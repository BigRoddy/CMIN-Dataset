2021-04-26	2021-04-26 09:08:51	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Honeywell Delivers 1Q Earnings Beat; Raises Guidance	Honeywell reported 1Q adjusted EPS of $1.92, coming in above analystsâ estimates of $1.80 per share and exceeding the high-end of the companyâs prior guidance range by $0.09. Meanwhile, Honeywellâs (HON) revenues in 1Q remained flat year-on-year but still came in ahead of consensus estimates of $8.08 billion. The aerospace and building technologies conglomerate reported revenues of $8.45 billion. Honeywellâs Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk said, âHoneywell delivered a strong start to 2021 with first-quarter results that exceeded our expectations. We are seeing promising signs of a rapid recovery in some of our markets, and we are poised to capitalize on new business opportunities as they ariseâ¦â âAs we look to the rest of 2021 and beyond, we are well positioned for the recovery to come. Our new offerings in growing markets like life sciences are gaining traction and the industries that were hardest hit by the pandemic are expected to improve throughout the year,â Adamczyk added. Revenues from HONâs aerospace segment fell 22% year-on-year on an organic basis to $2.63 billion but segment margin was up 110 basis points to 29% as a result of effective cost-management and one-time benefits. The companyâs building technologies segment returned a 2% year-on-year organic growth in sales to $1.4 billion, âdriven by strong bookings for services and security productsâ. The safety and productivity solutions business saw a 49% year-on-year rise in revenues to $2.1 billion fueled by double digit orders growth driven by rising demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and other productivity solutions. (See Honeywell stock analysis on TipRanks) The company also raised its guidance for FY21 and expects growth in organic sales to be in the 3% to 5% range. HON has forecasted adjusted EPS to be between $7.75 and $8.00, an increase of $0.15 from the low end of the earlier guidance range. The company expects free cash flow of between $5.2 billion and $5.5 billion. Following the earnings, Oppenheimer analyst Christopher Glynn assigned a Hold on the stock. Glynn said in a note to investors, âAero OM [operating margin] was exceptional at 29.0%, or ~28% excl. one-time/$30M benefit with the latter metric still strikingly high and flattish vs. record 1Q20 Aero OM. Robust operations seem accounted for in valuation.â Overall, consensus on the Street is a Moderate Buy based on 6 Buys and 4 Holds. The average analyst price target of $230.22 implies that the stock has upside potential of 2.5% to current levels.

2021-04-23	2021-04-23 21:20:27	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: SNAP, INTC, HON, INO	The market has been all over the place this week. After stocks looked fatigued, we had a routine dip. As bulls were buying that dip and stocks were rotating higher, a midday jolt on Thursday rattled investors. After a night to ponder, bulls were back to buying stocks on Friday. With all of that in mind, letâs look at a few top stock trades for Monday. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Snap (SNAP) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Snap (NYSE:SNAP) had a great post-earnings reaction in early trading, with a nice pop to the upside after solid results. But investors have sold those results. That would be less concerning if the market was performing poorly on the day. But the market â and tech specifically â is not performing poorly. So itâs a bit discouraging to see investors sell the rally in Snap. That said, the dip didnât do much technical damage.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips I will like Snap more on a move over $60, allowing it to clear this cluster of moving averages. Above that puts stout resistance in play near $65. If we can get a move over $60, then perhaps the stock can challenge the $70 to $73 area and the all-time highs. 7 Retail Stocks With E-commerce Locked In On the downside, however, a close below the 100-day moving average likely puts a weekly-down scenario in play. If that unfolds, $48 to $50 could be on the table. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Intel (INTC) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider While semiconductor stocks are trading well on Friday, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is not. However, itâs bouncing right where it needs to. Shares tested right down to the March low and the 100-day moving average. These levels acted as support, allowing shares to bounce. Keep an eye on this level, near $57.90. A close below this mark puts it below the 100-day moving average and gives traders a monthly-down rotation. That opens up $55 and the 200-day moving average. On the upside, though, look for a move over $60. Thatâs followed by a potential gap-fill up toward $62.25. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Honeywell (HON) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is enduring a modest dip on Friday, after the company reported earnings before the open. After a nice push to new all-time highs, shares are dipping down to the 21-day moving average. With buyers stepping in, look to see if they can push this back above the 10-day moving average and over $232. That opens the door the 161.8% extension near $235. From there, who knows, perhaps $250-plus is in play. On the downside, however, a break of Fridayâs low â also putting shares below the 21-day moving average â puts the $216 to $218 zone on the table. That puts Honeywell back into the prior breakout level, uptrend support and the 10-week and 50-day moving averages. 7 Big Data Stocks Supporting All Aspects of Life I would expect a bounce from this area should we get there. Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:INO) puked all over the rug this morning, and a hangover on Monday is possible. On Wednesday and Thursday, INO stock was perking up as it tried to break out of its downtrend. However, the 10-week moving average rejected it yesterday and today it plunged. Shares burst below critical support between $8.25 and $8.75. While itâs bouncing from Fridayâs low, keep these areas in mind. That is, the prior support zone and Fridayâs low. A break of Fridayâs low could put lower prices in play. A rally back to prior support needs to be reclaimed if bulls want to regain control. Look for this telling signal: Does prior support become resistance?

2021-04-23	2021-04-23 14:19:20	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Intel, American Express, Honeywell All Under Pressure After Earnings, But Snap Rebounds	The marketâs four-week winning streak looks threatened as todayâs session opens. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) closed just above 4185 a week ago and finished Thursday near 4135, so it would take a major rally for a green week after the taxmanâs visit yesterday. At the same time, there arenât a lot of new catalysts at work. Friday isnât the busiest earnings day of the season, but itâs just the calm before the storm. Next week is when the floodgates open and more than 100 S&P 500 companies report, including four of the five âFAANGâ companies along with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). More on that below. By this time a week from now, we should have a much better sense of whether analystsâ average estimate for 24% Q1 earnings growth is in the ballpark or needs adjustment. Despite Signs Of Rebound, Caution Still In Place Yesterday was a rough day thanks in part to new reminders of possible higher taxes (see more below). The Tech sector, especially semiconductors, took a licking, with those shares giving up a lot of Wednesdayâs gains. The so-called âhorsemen of riskâ were in the saddle as bonds and volatility galloped higher. Volatility eased a little this morning, but bonds continued climbing and the 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1.55%ânear the bottom of its recent range. Itâs been a slow data week, and today ends without many fireworks. The new home sales report for March is about the only big data point today, and analysts expect a steep climb to 912,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis from 775,000 a month earlier, according to research firm Briefing.com. Earnings-wise, companies are getting punished this morning. American Express (NYSE: AXP) and Honeywell (NYSE: HON) are both lower in pre-market trading. The pressure on HON appeared related to disappointment in its aerospace results, which missed the Streetâs views. AXP shareâs early softness is a classic case of what weâve been talking about this earnings season: Donât miss on revenue. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) shares also lost ground after reporting last night. The semiconductor firm may be getting a fish eye from investors because the company faces big costs to build new factories, which could potentially eat into margins. Having said that, itâs never a bad thing to see a company investing for its future, especially one like INTC which faces such heavy competition. One thing that stood out was INTCâs CEO saying the chip shortage could last at least two more years. Think about how that could affect automakers and everyone else. Itâs something to keep an eye on, because chips are used everywhere. Snap (NYSE: SNAP) had a very nice quarter. They lost money, but less than expected, revenue was solid, and user numbers looked good. The stock fell at first in pre-market trading, but then hustled back higher. One sector that performed pretty badly Thursday was Materials. Caught in the middle was Dow Inc. (DOW), whose earnings and revenue Thursday exceeded analyst expectations amid what analysts see as strong demand for its chemicals. If youâre an executive at DOW, youâre probably wondering what you have to do to impress Wall Street, considering the companyâs guidance also topped consensus views. Barronâs called the selling âa head-scratcherâ after a âblockbuster report.â Hard to argue with that. Maybe youâre wondering why itâs so hard for stocks to go up despite decent earnings this quarter. Well, when youâre near all-time highs, itâs hard to get rewarded. Itâs not like people are necessarily looking for a reason to buy more stock, especially stocks that have had incredible runs lately. âRead My Lips:â New Tax Proposal Hits Market This isnât a political column, but sometimes Washington makes it hard not to talk politics in this space. Weâre at one of those points after yesterdayâs Bloomberg report about the Biden administration possibly planning to raise capital gains taxes and tax rates on high earners. As you probably know by now, the news outlet reported that the Biden administration would increase the rate for the richest Americans to 39.6%, from 37%, percent, while raising the capital gains tax on people earning more than $1 million to 39.6%, from 20%. Stocks immediately took a clobbering on the news. Weâre not going to venture an opinion on the proposals themselves. But you canât help but think that some investors might see the news as a sell signal and try to exit positions ahead of any new taxes coming down from the Beltway. Thatâs just what tends to happen when thereâs news like this. If youâre an investor and had plans to sell anyway, maybe it just puts more oil on the fire to get it done. However, if youâre in the market for the long-term, a new tax proposal or two shouldnât necessarily affect your day-to-day planning. For one thing, thereâs absolutely no certainty that Congress has the ability to pass this proposal. For another thing, tax rates tend to change a lot over time, depending on the administration. Itâs like the weather in Chicago: If you donât like it now, wait a few minutes. While selling definitely picked up yesterday on the tax news, itâs really nothing all that new when you think about it, Briefing.com pointed out. After all, President Biden campaigned on higher taxes for the wealthy. So Thursdayâs sell-off might have been one of those times when people were looking for excuses to book some profit and chose that one. Overall, the Materials, Energy, Consumer Discretionary, and Info Tech sectors were hardest hit by selling yesterday. Not a single S&P 500 sector finished in the green. If stocks keep getting pounded today, a possible technical support point might be near the 50-day moving average for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), now at 3970. A drop below that might cause technical selling to pick up. Crude Choppy, Crypto Chopped Crudeâs had an odd week. Itâs chopped up and down and at one point fell below $60 a barrel amid worries about demand from India and other parts of Asia where Covid cases are up. Since reaching $60 a barrel for the first time post-Covid in mid-February, the crude front-month has been surprisingly stable. It hasnât fallen much below $60 or risen much above $65 over these two months. If you watch crude over time, youâll see it often carves a trading range and stays there for a while. It would probably take a move above the 2021 high of $67.98 or a drop below the March low of $57.25 to upset the apple cart much in this market. Itâs also been an odd week for Bitcoin. Well, maybe odd isnât the right word. Itâs just getting hammered, and fell below $50,000. Thatâs after piercing $60,000 for the first time not long ago. One possible reason for the weakness could be worry about how any new tax proposal could affect profits from trading in cryptocurrencies. Remember, thatâs still pretty unclear, and remains in the realm of speculation for now. Also, maybe itâs worth noting that the last time the capital gains tax went up (in 2013), the SPX rose 30%. CHART OF THE DAY: BUILDING UP. Need a data point to demonstrate the strength in all things building? Here are two: The S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index ($SPSIHOâcandlestick) and CME Groupâs Comex Copper futures (/HGâpurple line). As commodity prices continued to surge, homebuilder activity forged ahead in lockstep. Data sources: CME Group, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswimÂ® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Broken Record Department: Youâve heard it here before and youâll hear it again: Earnings drive the market. This may sound like the record is skipping, but itâs true. And if youâre only going to focus on earnings one week out of the quarter, make it this coming week or youâll miss the top-40 countdown. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are just a few of the big names stepping onto the earnings stage after this weekend. One thing they all have in common, obviously, is exposure to the Tech sector, even if AMZN, GOOGL, and TSLA arenât officially âTechâ stocks. Together, these stocks make up 80% of the so-called âFAANGs,â and MSFT is often thought of as a FAANG cousin who might fit on the list if itâs name didnât start with a letter that would mess up the cool word. Youâre also talking almost $9 trillion in market cap spread across those six stocks. Together, they make up more than a quarter of the S&P 500âs market capitalization, and how they do can really make or break an earnings season. Weâve already previewed GOOGLâs earningsâwhere advertising revenue and cloud technology are likely to be in focusâand FB, which has seen solid ad revenue growth but may have a couple headwinds ahead. Stay tuned for previews of AAPL, TSLA, and AMZN. Refi High: Speaking of broken records, hereâs an oldie but a goodie: with interest rates heading back down after last monthâs spike, mortgage applicationsâand specifically mortgage refinancesâare back on the front burner, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). Overall mortgage activity was up 8.6% on the week last week, but refi applications were up 10%, and as of last week make up 60% of all applications. According to Bankrateâs weekly survey, average rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage ticked down six basis points to 3.21% (but still 30 basis points higher than the record low set in January). In and of itself, refis are a good thing for the consumer economy, as they tend to lower a fixed line item in the budget, thus leaving more room for discretionary spending, like home renovations, for example. Where it gets tricky, however, is when refinancers take cash out of their homes (the âcash-out refiâ that hit fever pitch just before the financial crisis in 2008). According to Freddie Mac, borrowers cashed out about $48 billion in refis in Q4 2020âthe highest level since late 2008. When you look at the trends in housing and commodity prices (see chart above), itâs tempting to conclude weâre setting up for another bruising pullback. But the housing market is fundamentally different than it was in 2008. And considering how unprecedented the pandemic has been, itâs probably folly to compare anything to 2020 and draw conclusions. An Abundance Of You Know What: Before the tax worries cratered Wall Street yesterday, it had been a pretty nice broad-based rally at midweek, if you take the steep Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) losses out of the equation. Still, the better performing sectors over the last week have still been defensive ones like Utilities, Health Care and Real Estate. Plus you have the bond market making some gains and volatility edging higher. Caution seems to be the watchword. That being said, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) couldnât take out 20 on Thursday and the 10-year yield stayed above its recent 1.52% low. Those could be reckoning points to watch today and next week for hints at the marketâs next move. TD AmeritradeÂ® commentary for educational purposes only. Member SIPC.

Honeywell sees slow recovery in commercial aerospace business, shares fall	(Reuters) -Honeywell International Inc said on Friday sales at its aerospace business would trend at the lower end of its full-year forecast due to a slow recovery in its high-margin commercial aftermarket sales business, sending shares down 3%.  Honeywell, which makes aircraft parts for planes manufactured by Boeing Co and Canada's Bombardier Inc, saw its revenue tumble after the COVID-19 pandemic brought air travel to a standstill.  Rising infection rates and the lack of peak holiday travel led to fewer flight hours and hit the company's air transport aftermarket sales, which fell 48% from last year.	https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/honeywell-reports-9-7-fall-110532752.html?.tsrc=rss

In fact, Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) has produced a total return of just 188% over the last 10 years, underperforming the S&P 500's 264% total return.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/fc19101a-59af-3a51-a1d9-c73f78739470/3-stocks-warren-buffett.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-09	2021-02-09 14:53:27	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Unusual Options Activity Insight: Honeywell International	"Shares of Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) saw some unusual options activity on Tuesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $203.38. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-03-19 Strike Price: $210.00 Volume: 10046 Open Interest: 2961 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-02-04	2021-02-04 10:00:00	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	UPS Gives Old Jets New Life in CEOâs Push to âSweat the Assetsâ	(Bloomberg) -- Imagine ripping out the dashboard of your 20-year-old minivan and replacing it with the high-tech controls from a Tesla.Thatâs pretty much what United Parcel Service Inc. is doing to squeeze two more decades of life from dozens of aging Airbus SE freighters by revamping their cockpit computers. Itâs all part of new Chief Executive Officer Carol Tomeâs strategy to âsweat the assetsâ by increasing efficiency while reducing investment.The 52 Airbus A300-600 jets were purchased beginning in 2000 and the flight computer has such limited memory that it canât store full navigational maps, forcing UPS to divide the U.S. into five regions to hold the information. Each update takes 45 minutes and has to be done each time a plan needs to fly to a different area.âThis is a huge productivity improvement for us,â said Ed Walton, director of engineering for UPSâs aircraft maintenance unit. âWe had a 1970s-generation flight management system that only had 200K of memory. Itâs kind of shocking that we were able to stretch it out this long.âThe upgrades use a Honeywell International Inc. system and are a less-expensive alternative to purchasing replacement cargo jets. One drawback is that keeping old planes in service means burning more fuel. But Tome is under pressure to bolster profit margins and reduce capital spending, which will drop to $4 billion this year from $5.6 billion last year and more than $6 billion in each of the previous two years as UPS invested heavily to boost efficiency.UPS declined to detail how much itâs spending, or saving, on the avionic overhauls. The A300 is no longer in production, but a new Boeing Co. 767 Freighter, a slightly larger plane that UPS has bought recently, has a market value of $80.8 million, according to aviation consulting firm Avitas.The new Honeywell system will hold worldwide navigational maps and take about two minutes for updates. It also will have larger displays than the old screens and tools such as a central maintenance system and improved weather radar that enables pilots to avoid storms.The Atlanta-based courier plans to purchase 11 new aircraft this year, down from 16 in 2020, as air-cargo volume surges during the pandemic because of growth in online retail and Covid-19 vaccine distribution. Couriers are also hauling some freight that would have been carried by passenger jets had the pandemic not forced airlines to slash their schedules.Airbus completed the upgrade and flight testing of the first A300. UPS is looking to choose two companies to do the modifications, which take about three weeks, on the remaining 51 aircraft. The company expects to have them all retrofitted and flying by next year.For Honeywell, the contract is its first complete avionics replacement on a cargo plane, said Mike Madsen, chief executive officer of the companyâs aerospace unit. Doing such work for freight companies is a huge potential market.âMost of them operate the older aircraft because itâs economically attractive,â Madsen said. âThere are easily a thousand aircraft that could take advantage of this system.âFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-gives-old-jets-life-100000599.html?.tsrc=rss

Despite the 4Q beat, its shares closed 3.7% lower on Friday. Honeywellâs (HON) 4Q earnings of $2.07 per share remained flat year-over-year but topped the companyâs guidance range of $1.97-$2.02 per share as well as analystsâ expectations of $2.00. Its revenues of $8.9 billion declined 6% year-over-year but came in above the Streetâs forecasts of $8.4 billion. Organic revenues decreased by 7% during the quarter, reflecting weakness across most of its business segments. However, organic sales for its Safety and Productivity Solutions segment jumped 27% in 4Q. The companyâs CEO Darius Adamczyk said, âHoneywell's strong balance sheet put us in a good position to weather the challenges of 2020 while investing for future growth. We invested in high-return capital expenditures, repurchased $3.7 billion of Honeywell shares, completed three acquisitions, made six new investments within Honeywell Ventures, and announced our 11th consecutive dividend increase.â As for 2021, the company expects to generate revenues of $33.4 billion to $34.4 billion versus analystsâ expectations of $33.95 billion. It projects an organic revenue growth range of about 1% to 4% for 2021. Furthermore, Honeywell forecasts adjusted earnings to be in the range of $7.60 to $8.00 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 7% to 13%. Analysts were looking for earnings of $7.87 per share. (See Honeywell stock analysis on TipRanks) On Jan. 29, Cowen & Co. analyst Gautam Khanna maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $225 (15.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said, âQ4 adj EPS beat due to stronger sales in all segments, and margin impressed at Aero where aero aftermarket rose 26% vs. Q3.â Overall, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 9 Buys and 8 Holds. The average analyst price target of $210.19 implies upside potential of about 7.6% to current levels. Shares gained 13.9% in the past year.

2021-01-28	2021-01-28 15:10:04	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Honeywell International's Earnings Outlook	"Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) unveils its next round of earnings this Friday, January 29. Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for the earnings announcement. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Sell-side analysts expect Honeywell International's EPS to be near $2.0 on sales of $8.40 billion. In the same quarter last year, Honeywell International reported earnings per share of $2.06 on sales of $9.50 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on HON If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Friday, earnings would be down 2.91%. Revenue would be down 11.54% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 1.49 1.21 1.95 2.04 EPS Actual 1.56 1.26 2.21 2.06 Revenue Estimate 7.65 B 7.29 B 8.57 B 9.61 B Revenue Actual 7.80 B 7.48 B 8.46 B 9.50 B Stock Performance Shares of Honeywell International were trading at $199.21 as of January 27. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 16.68%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders should be content going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Honeywell International is scheduled to hold the call at 08:30:00 ET and can be accessed here.

2021-01-22	2021-01-22 17:34:59	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Under CEO Stuart Bradie, KBRâs Energy Shift Is Generating Promise	Nothing exemplifies the evolution of the economy â from energy to technology â better than the story of KBR (NYSE:KBR). In fact, KBR stock is a prime example. Source: IgorGolovniov/shutterstock.com KBR originally stood for Kellogg, Brown & Root, significant names in the 20th century energy industry. For instance, during the Giant years of the 1950s, Brown & Root was the main contractor to call into oilfields. Whatâs more, the Brown family name is even all over my alma mater, Rice University â the company actually the built our football stadium. All that is to say that the Browns were one of the greatest American entrepreneurial stories of their time. And, in recently exiting the energy business, KBR has now made one of the greatest executive turns of the early 21st century.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Thatâs all due to CEO Stuart Bradie â I wonder what the Browns would have made of him. A New Phase for KBR Stock In 2020, CEO Stuart Bradie led KBRâs exit from the fixed-price energy construction business. Instead of the old business, Bradie said that the new KBR will focus on government services and technology. 7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day This is a massive change. Energy services contracts, including liquified natural gas (LNG) terminals, had been 75% of the companyâs business as recently as 2015. On top of that, the company had been a part of Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) â the oil field services giant â up until 2007. But KBR followed its energy announcement in August by buying Centauri, a military technology contractor, for $800 million. In the companyâs second-quarter report, Bradie said about the shift to its two new areas of focus: âThe transformation of our operating model greatly simplifies our business and allows us to further reduce risk and narrow our strategic focus. We continue to move upmarket into differentiated areas that provide attractive returns, consistent growth and strong cash conversion.â Bradie came in as the CEO of KBR back in 2014, moving from the Australian energy and chemicals company Worley (OTCMKTS:WYGPF). He began the move out of energy when that business was at its peak, growing KBRâs government services unit through acquisitions like Honeywellâs (NYSE:HON) technology solutions business. Now, he says KBR has achieved carbon neutrality and plans to be net-zero in carbon by 2030. Moreover, the âachievement of the companyâs [environmental, social and governance] ESG goalsâ are now tied to its executive compensation plan. So far, it seems that these changes are going well. Instead of building LNG plants, KBR is now analyzing satellite data for the U.S. Geological Survey. Itâs also the advisor for a hydrogen project in South Korea. Plus, itâs winning contracts on plastic recycling and carbon recycling. This could all be great news for KBR stock. By the Numbers However, none of this will matter if the company canât do it at a profit. KBR stock entered trade on Jan. 22 at about $30.54 per share. Thatâs a market cap of about $4.38 billion, on what should be 2020 revenues of $5.82 billion. Of course, operations were hit hard by the pandemic and oil crash, so the company will likely report a loss for all of 2020. But KBR did make $52 million in net income for the third quarter, with revenue of nearly $1.4 billion, just $46 million short of what it did a year earlier. Moreover, analysts expect KBR to earn about 48 cents per share for the fourth quarter, on revenue of $1.5 billion. At the end of September, KBR reported $1.47 billion of long-term debt and $949 million in cash. However, as part of the transition, Bradie replaced the letter of credit system KBR had used for debt with a revolving credit facility that lets it borrow up to nearly $1.8 billion. The Bottom Line Thereâs no denying it: Bradie began executing his turn from the top of the energy curve and got his company and KBR stock out just as the market was crashing. Plus, in his third quarter report, Bradie noted $269 million in operating cash flow through September, solid margins of 9% and increased cash and earnings guidance for the full year. He dubbed the Centauri acquisition âhighly strategic.â Essentially, this CEO has turned an energy engineering firm into a technology services business against a backdrop of slowly falling energy prices. The company today is fully valued, maybe a little overvalued based on cash flow. But that doesnât mean it should fall off your radar. And Stuart Bradie is still just 54. When it comes to KBR, I canât wait for his next trick.

2021-01-15	2021-01-15 17:35:24	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Understanding Honeywell International's Unusual Options Activity	"Shares of Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $206.68.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-15  * Strike Price: $210.00  * Volume: 294  * Open Interest: 1721Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Understanding NVIDIA's Unusual Options Activity  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: Nordstrom(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

2020-12-24	2020-12-24 12:00:20	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	The Year We Were Hot for Supercold Freezers	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The pandemic has given many of us a newÂ appreciation forÂ things weÂ tookÂ for grantedÂ before Covid-19: time with friends and family,Â a night out at a restaurant, travelÂ â¦ and yes, evenÂ indoor air quality.Â Despite my being a columnist covering the industrial sector, I didnât spend much time thinking about ventilationÂ pre-pandemic, nor was I overly preoccupied withÂ the existence of technology that can produce temperatures as low as -70 degrees CelsiusÂ âÂ colder than the average temperature on Mars, but also the conditions needed to keep Pfizer Inc.âs Covid-19 vaccine stable.Â Now I think about both of those things all theÂ time. And so do investors: Itâs not a coincidence that two of the top 10 industrial stocks this year âÂ Carrier Global Corp. and Trane Technologies Plc âÂ make air conditioners and freezers.The pandemic has created something of a moment for ventilation and refrigeration.Â And yet, while the industry has invested in certain innovations and reconfigurationsÂ to adapt to the coronavirus, the underlying technology has existed for years, whirringÂ away quietly in the background of our lives. Really, itâs our awareness ofÂ these companiesâ capabilities thatâs changed.Â âIndoor air quality isnât a new concept,â Chris Nelson, president of Carrierâs heating, ventilation and air conditioning division, said in an interview. âIt has become âÂ I don't know if I would say more important, because obviously it wasÂ important from the get-go â but it's becoming very prevalent.â Knowing what we now know about airborne viruses and the importance of ventilation, humidity control and filtrationÂ in controlling the spread of disease, itâs hard to imagine society willÂ just forget and move on, he said.Â Nelson compared increasedÂ attentionÂ aroundÂ the importance of indoor-air quality to the reassessment of security measures following the Sept.Â 11 terrorist attacks.Â âHopefully it's the last airborne virus,â heÂ said. âBut likely not.âCarrier estimates that demandÂ for indoor-air quality improvements could generate $10 billion in new revenue opportunities across the industry, including $165 million of projectsÂ the company is already discussingÂ with customers. Some 90% of a personâs life is spent indoors, and people are also realizing the impact air quality can have on allergies, asthma and even cognitive capabilities, NelsonÂ said.Â Honeywell International Inc. has flagged a more thanÂ $600 million sales pipeline for its âhealthy buildingsâ products, whileÂ Johnson Controls International Plc CEO George Oliver has said his company isÂ looking at potentialÂ projects in this vein worthÂ âa couple of hundred millionâ dollars for just next year.While TraneÂ has always sold advanced technology that uses chemical reactionsÂ to clean the air, its typical customers were hospitalsÂ or labs.Â Purifying air with such next-level measures was a harder sellÂ pre-pandemic because the air-quality benefits werenât the kind of thingÂ you could physically see, DaveÂ Regnery, Traneâs president and chief operating officer, said in an interview. Now, customer inquiries are coming from all directions, he said. For example, Trane teamed upÂ with biodefenseÂ company Synexis to develop a system that purifies the air butÂ also coats and cleans the surfaces in the room. Itâs marketing this to K-12Â schools.Â Carrier is selling its portable OptiClean product âÂ which both scrubs the air and creates negative pressure that prevents air from spreading from one area to the next âÂ to retailers, hotels, factoriesÂ and more, Nelson said. Meanwhile, Johnson ControlsÂ is holding conversations with universities about designing pandemic-proof dormitories where each room canÂ be transformed intoÂ a pressurized isolation chamberÂ with the flip of a switch, Tyler Smith, executive director of the companyâs healthy buildings program, said in an interview. âNew buildings will be built differently because of what we learnedâ in the pandemic, he said.Executives from Carrier, Johnson Controls and Trane all expect theÂ increased interest in indoor air quality to ultimately translate into some kind of standardized climate-controlÂ ratings system thatÂ indicates where buildings fall on the spectrum of things like ventilation, humidity control, filtration and energy efficiency. This could beÂ akin to or even an expansion of theÂ Leadership in Energy and Environmental Designâs (LEED)Â ranking of green buildings or the Well system of assessing a facilityâs impact on health and well-being; basically, a calling card of sorts that advertises how clean the air is in that particular office space or indoor arena. Once thereâsÂ a standard, progress can be measured and problems can be rectified through digital solutions that turn buildings into treasure troves of data, which can then be analyzed and mined for recommendations on how to improveÂ performance.Â âThere will certainly be more standardization of what constitutes a âgoodâÂ building,âÂ Mike Ellis, chief digital and customerÂ officer at Johnson Controls, said in an interview. âThe pandemic is a catalyst to think about real estate in a different way.âÂ  The company recently launched its OpenBlueÂ software platform, which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to not only map out trouble spots but teach buildings to make their own improvements.Whether there will be as much of a need for ultracold freezers after the pandemicÂ is less clear, but the focus on vaccine distribution has brought some astonishing figures to light. About a quarter of shots degrade before they reach their final destination, andÂ a third of food intended for human consumption is wasted,Â David Appel, president of refrigeration at Carrier, said in an interview. âIf food waste was a country, it would be the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases,â he said. âTodayâs reality is shining a big bright light on the need for a stronger, more connected cold chain. We know that vaccine distribution at the best of times can be challenging. We know because that's what we've been doing for years.âTo meet the expected surge in demand for cold storage amid the massive Covid-19 vaccine rollout now underway, Carrier introduced mobile freezer pods enabled with temperature monitoring technology that can serve as temporary containers and extend the life of dry ice.Â The largest version of these containers can hold up to a million doses of a vaccine; Carrier has 300 of them ready to be deployed, another 300 on order and could ramp up production to 2,000 a month if needed, Appel said. These pods could be a vitalÂ stop-gap solution for countries such asÂ India that are behind the curve onÂ investments in cold-chain infrastructure, he said.Traneâs Thermo King refrigeration unit reworked a niche productÂ forÂ flash-freezing sushi-grade fish so it can be used to distributeÂ vaccines instead. Known as the SuperFreezer, this systemÂ canÂ get as cold asÂ -70 degrees Celsius â cold enough to preserve the taste, texture and freshness of fish used in sashimi and cold enough to store the coronavirus vaccines developed by Pfizer and BioNTech SE without dry ice, if needed. That may be important for rural areas with less access to dry ice, or if the spike in demand creates a shortage.Â Traneâs SuperFreezerÂ has about 60 times the capacity of typical freezer farms and the temperature can be adjusted to meet the requirements of Moderna Inc.âs coronavirus vaccine as well, Regnery said.Â And thatâs the funny thing about this pandemic. You never know how essential things like air scrubbers and sushi freezers are until you really need them.Â This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-12-16	2020-12-16 06:30:19	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	After Trumpâs Sanctions, Biden Can Reset With Turkey	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Turks are debating whether the sanctions imposed on their defense procurement agency by the Trump administration are âlightâ or âheavy.â The sanctions, under the Countering Americaâs Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, are meant to punish Turkey for its purchase of Russiaâs S-400 missile-defense system, which its NATO allies say compromise the allianceâs defenses.They target the procurement agency, known by its Turkish acronym SSB, for âknowingly engaging in a significant transactionâ with Rosoboronexport, Russiaâs main arms-export entity. The sanctions bar the SSB from U.S. export licenses and authorizations for any goods or technology, from loans or credits by U.S. financial institutions, and from U.S. Export-Import Bank assistance for exports. They also impose an American veto on loans by multilateral financial institutions to SSB.Sanctions have also been imposed on SSB president Ismail Demir and three other officials, blocking any assets they may have in American jurisdictions and barring their entry into the U.S.Many in Turkey view the sanctions announced on Monday as being âlightâ because the package does not include measures that could impact the countryâs financial system. But in reality, such measures were never likely. Once the U.S. decided to invoke CAATSA, the range of targets was limited to individuals or entities who are involved with, or have facilitated, the transaction with already sanctioned Russian military industrial companies.In my view, the package should be considered a moderately heavy set of measures, similar in nature to the CAATSA sanctions imposed on China in 2018, afterÂ Beijingâs purchase of the S400 system and the SU 35 fighter from Russia.A âlightâ package would have been limited to sanctions against specific officials. A âheavyâ package might have prohibited the SSB from engaging in U.S. dollar denominated transactions. Â But the act is not designed for use against a countryâs financial system like, say, the sanctions against Iran, which have their own separate legal basis in the Iran Sanctions Act.The sanctions, the first of their kind against a NATO ally, will essentially affect Turkeyâs burgeoning military-industrial ecosystem. Direct military sales are not at risk since these transactions can be carried out directly by the Turkish military. But the sanctions will handicap the ability of the Turkish government to embark on long-term partnerships with American companies; these are necessary for the development of advanced platforms like new fighter planes or missile-defense systems.There is also a risk that European companies may also be spooked by these measures and be less willing to enter multinational military-industrial projects led by the SSB.The ban on access to American technology could also hinder the ability of Turkish military companies to export systems that incorporate U.S. technology. The planned $1.3 billion sale of attack helicopters to Pakistan has already been delayed because the U.S. has been holding back export clearances for the helicopterâs Honeywell International engines.How will Turkey respond? Ahead of the sanctions announcement, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that he would regard their imposition as âdisrespectfulâ to Turkey. But since the announcement, the foreign ministry has said only that it âwill retaliate in a manner and timing it deems appropriate.âPolicymakers in Ankara now face a quandary. Turkeyâs reaction can take the form of further alienation from the West, building on the narrative that the West has become an unreliable strategic partner and is seeking to undermine the countryâs inevitable rise to world-power status. Turkey would then seek to deepen its collaboration with non-NATO powers like Russia and China. The end result could be more sanctions and Turkeyâs divorce from the Western community of nations, a detrimental outcome for both sides.A more palatable alternative is for the Turkish government to recognize the overall costs of its anchorless foreign policy of the past few years, and view the incoming Biden administration as an opportunity to re-engage with Washington. The âwait and seeâ tone of the statement issued by the foreign ministry can be taken as an indication of the willingness to await the change of guard in the White House.Bidenâs arrival represents an opportunity for a broader reset. The new president will inherit a vastly differentÂ geopolitical landscape compared to the last year he held office as vice president. Turkey figures more prominently now in many of the regional conflicts and dynamics. The convergence of foreign-policy visions would undoubtedly help both Turkey and the U.S. to navigate their regional challenges.Provided that Washington and Ankara agree on such a common vision enshrined in a new strategic roadmap, the priority should be the removal of the CAATSA sanctions. The National Defense Authorization Act awaiting veto-proof congressional approval includes a clause that the lifting of CAATSA sanctions be conditional on Turkey ceasing ownership of the S-400 system. That may be politically unfeasible: It is tantamount to asking the Turkish government to publicly acknowledge the futility of a multi-billion dollar purchase.Â Instead, Ankara and Washington could possibly agree on a joint monitoring regime that would eliminate the surprise element in any future decision to operationalize these systems.The CAATSA sanctions should therefore be viewed as the first act of a new Turkey-U.S. relationship that will be shaped by the willingness of Biden and Erdogan to find common ground and salvage a critical relationship.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sinan Ulgen is the executive chairman of Istanbul-based think tank EDAM and a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinionSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-sanctions-biden-reset-turkey-063019272.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-07	2020-11-07 20:30:00	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Whatâs Ahead Under President Joe Biden, Industry by Industry	(Bloomberg) -- Now that the campaigning is over, the work begins for Joe Biden to start making good on the policy changes he promised. Hereâs a breakdown of how a Biden presidency may affect some two dozen U.S. industries and what might rise to the top of his agenda as he takes over from Donald Trump in January. A few giant tech companies -- practically industries unto themselves -- are included for good measure.There are recurring themes in this compilation: The more closely a company interacts with individual American consumers, the more pressing are matters of Covid-19 restrictions and wages. For technology and industrial companies, trade and visa policies are key. While thereâs a chance Americans may not know until January whether Republicans keep control of the Senate, some executives are fine if the government stays divided because it lowers the odds of major legislation.These items were crafted by Bloomberg News beat reporters and editors, and each industry and company name links to a corresponding Bloomberg Intelligence dashboard or profile. For an even more specific analysis of the public policies at stake -- including the probability of passage -- see the Election Matrix put together by our Bloomberg Intelligence colleagues.CONSUMERS: Cars, Planes & RetailAIRLINES: Biden-era regulators may have a heavier hand than airlines felt under Trump. Elaine Chaoâs Transportation Department gave airlines great leeway on consumer issues. Debates over seat space could be revived under Biden, as could the levels of aircraft carbon emissions. The DOT also has declined to mandate face coverings on planes. Potential Biden changes to the National Labor Relations Board may help union organizers at carriers such as Delta Air Lines Inc. One question is whether a Biden administration would be more hostile to additional consolidation, especially if airlinesâ finances worsen and creditors seek structural changes. -- Brendan CaseAUTOMAKERS: Bidenâs election cuts both ways for car companies. His plan to renew and fund more tax credits for consumers who buy electric vehicles could help manufacturers including General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., Tesla Inc. and Volkswagen AG that are investing billions in electric models that still sell in small numbers. On the other hand, Biden is more likely to levy tougher emissions rules on the gas-burning vehicles that pay Detroitâs way. -- David WelchREAD MORE: Detroit Faces Delicate Dance With Red-State SupportersCANNABIS: Bidenâs win may hasten federal legalization, helping cannabis companies get more access to capital from banks and letting marijuana businesses accept credit cards and have checking accounts. This could happen with the passage of the STATES Act, which defers legalization to the states, or the MORE Act, which would remove cannabis from the list of controlled substances. Thereâs hope that either bill would help get rid of tax code 280E, which bars cannabis companies from deducting their operating expenses for tax purposes -- something that could immediately see many of their earnings turn positive. That said, such scenarios arenât likely until at least 2021. -- Tiffany KaryREAD MORE: Cannabis, No Longer so Divisive, Draws More Conservative SupportCASINOS: Biden has said he doesnât support the Justice Departmentâs decision last year to reassert provisions of the 1961 Wire Act, a move viewed as a threat to online gambling in the U.S. The Trump administrationâs stance threw a cloud over the fastest-growing part of the industry: online and sports betting. Bidenâs harder line on coronavirus restrictions could close casinos again if the pandemic worsens, but his close ties to casino-worker unions could see future stimulus funds directed toward them. -- Chris PalmeriMANUFACTURERS: Major watch items include perennial concerns such as taxes and regulation, as well as trade -- especially whether Biden will seek to improve global ties after four years of tensions stoked by Trump. The stakes are particularly high for aerospace companies in China, where a rebound in air travel offers a rare bright spot amid the coronavirus pandemic. That will put an even sharper focus on what is already a crucial market for Boeing Co., General Electric Co. and Honeywell International Inc. For defense contractors, Bernstein analyst Doug Harned expects spending priorities to be similar under either Biden or Trump because global threats are high, and building more planes and ships is a way to preserve U.S. jobs and jolt the economy. Biden is widely expected to raise corporate taxes in line with his plan of hiking the rate to 28% from 20% currently. -- Brendan CaseREAD MORE: Transatlantic Trade War Brews as EU Eyes Nov. 10 Tariff StrikeRESTAURANTS: Bidenâs goal to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from $7.25 could reduce profit and lead to some job cuts, even as it otherwise improves workersâ living standards. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Michael Halen sees Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. and Texas Roadhouse Inc. as among the most at risk because of their prevalence in low-wage states. Labor already accounted for 31% of restaurant costs in 2019, surpassing food. Restaurateurs could be helped if Biden brings new funding, loans or paycheck protections. But any further Covid-19-related shutdowns or dining restrictions, which Biden has hinted at, could hurt. -- Carolina GonzalezRETAILERS: Retailers, particularly those deemed nonessential such as department stores, could be at higher risk of more Covid-19-related closings under Biden. They also may have to contend with higher expenses, especially if Biden gets the federal minimum wage lifted to $15. That said, Biden also will renew stimulus talks with urgency, increasing the likelihood that American wallets and small businesses get a boost. -- Jordyn HolmanHEALTH CARE: Insurers, Pharma & Med TechHEALTH INSURERS: Bidenâs win will mean new efforts to bolster the Affordable Care Act -- and expand insurance coverage and subsidies to help more people afford it. Heâll roll back some of Trumpâs administrative changes that weakened the ACA. Heâs said heâll create a public health-insurance option like Medicare that could compete with private insurers. -- John TozziMEDICAL TECHNOLOGY: Biden plans to double down on testing to help control the coronavirus outbreak, bolstering drive-through sites, investing in next-generation technology and creating a board to shepherd the production and distribution of tens of millions of tests nationwide. He also pledged to return production of medical-technology goods to the U.S. and stockpile essential components to reduce dependence on other countries in a crisis. -- Michelle Fay CortezPHARMACEUTICALS: Biden would seek to strengthen and cement the Affordable Care Act, expanding access to health insurance to even more Americans and helping them afford their medications. He has said he plans to address the high prices Americans pay for prescription drugs with proposals that include allowing the governmentâs Medicare program to negotiate costs, letting patients import drugs from abroad and linking price hikes to inflation. -- Michelle Fay CortezTECHNOLOGY, TELECOM & MEDIAALPHABET INC.: The Obama administration was quite cozy with Alphabetâs Google and other big tech companies, with workers doing stints in the White House or government and then returning later to Silicon Valley. Itâs likely former Google employees will be top candidates for Biden administration positions. That said, the attitude toward big tech has shifted considerably since the Obama years, and Biden may keep the tech giant at armâs length because of concerns that Google has grown too big and powerful. Biden has spoken out specifically against Section 230, a part of a law from the early days of the internet that protects big platforms including Google Search and YouTube from being sued for things their users post. The companies contend the rule is vital to keeping the web free and open, but politicians increasingly want it changed. Biden could put energy behind the Democratic proposal to hold social-media platforms liable for the misinformation and harmful content posted on them. That could increase the cost of moderating YouTube, or even slow growth if the company is forced to vet videos before they go up. -- Gerrit De VynckAMAZON.COM INC.: While a Biden administration would likely mean a break from Trumpâs Twitter attacks on Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, Democratic control over the White House and Congress could mean ramped-up antitrust scrutiny of the retail giant. The Democrat-led House Antitrust Subcommitteeâs investigation included recommendations that, if passed into law, could place restrictions on Amazonâs ability to operate the largest online marketplace and sell its own goods in the same digital storefront. -- Matt DayAPPLE INC.: Bidenâs victory could be a major win for Apple, since heâs less likely to maintain a trade war with China and may loosen tariffs that have hurt the iPhone makerâs margins on some products. Biden also has pledged to reverse a Trump policy and offer more H-1B visas to foreign engineers Apple and other technology companies want to hire. Biden appears more likely to negotiate on antitrust issues; his criticisms about Big Tech hurt Appleâs quest to protect the way its App Store works. Cynthia Hogan, Appleâs former chief lobbyist in Washington, was on Bidenâs vice-presidential search committee, potentially giving Apple a leg up with the new administration. -- Mark GurmanCHIPMAKERS: For the $400-billion chip industry, Bidenâs win probably will ratchet down a trade war between the U.S. and China. Most U.S. semiconductor makers have their products manufactured overseas, and the Trump administration imposed import tariffs that disrupted this global supply chain. Trump also slapped sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co. and other Chinese tech companies, hurting the ability of U.S. chipmakers to sell into the largest market for their products. In turn, China redoubled efforts to build a domestic chip industry and shed its dependence on U.S. technology, earmarking billions of dollars for the effort. Any easing of these tensions will benefit the U.S. chip sector. -- Ian KingHOLLYWOOD: While Biden has taken a tougher stance on economic reopening than Trump, his election may not disrupt Hollywood much. The industry has only partially gone back to work, hampered by the drastically increased costs of making new content. Biden has signaled heâll prioritize getting industries battered by the virus back on their feet, suggesting companies could access funds needed to resume operations. When the pandemic finally does clear, life in Hollywood will probably go on as normal. The American film industry has come to dominate the world, in part because it has enjoyed wide, bipartisan support for decades. -- Kelly GilblomSOCIAL MEDIA: The end of the Trump era may make it easier for Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. to enforce their own rules without a sitting president at the middle of most debates. Bidenâs arrival also might ease internal tension at the companies: Hundreds of Facebook employees held a virtual walkout in June, for example, after Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg refused to remove a Trump post about protests in Minneapolis. As Trumpâs online platform of choice, Twitter may have the most to lose by his departure from the White House. A Biden presidency may temper political posts on TikTok, the music-video app that became a home for activist clips during the pandemic. -- Kurt Wagner and Shelly BanjoREAD MORE: Thriving New York Times, Fox News Ponder a Post-Trump ScenarioTELECOM / WIRELESS: The phone giants -- AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. -- donât really get a big friend in the White House with President-elect Biden. Itâs likely network neutrality comes back as a key issue for the Democrats, who will push to establish internet-fairness rules and possibly impose price rules on network traffic. Under Trump, the earlier rules were found to be an overreach by regulators. Another agenda item is broadband for all. You can expect this âdigital-divideâ problem to be addressed. Thereâs one big break with a Biden win: The GOPâs call for a government-run 5G network will go away. -- Scott MoritzCOMMODITIES & ENERGYAGRICULTURE: Any Biden rollback of tariffs on Chinese goods could clear the way for more shipments of U.S. farm products to Asia. But thereâs concern a transition away from oil under Biden could erode demand for corn- and soy-based biofuels, which are mixed in with petroleum-based motor fuels. Some more left-leaning Democrats also may try to take a harder line against big agriculture companies. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker have said the U.S. response to coronavirus outbreaks at meat plants this year was âfeckless.â -- Michael HirtzerCOPPER & INDUSTRIAL METALS: Industrial metals such as copper would be a big beneficiary from additional stimulus and infrastructure spending, according to analysts including those at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The upside under a divided government will be more limited or delayed. Goldman says global spending on green infrastructure will fuel metals demand in the next few years, noting a âfront-footedâ policy environment in Europe and China, with prospects for a similar U.S. agenda under a Biden administration. -- Yvonne Yue LiENERGY: Bidenâs victory could end up reshaping the U.S. energy sector in years to come, although the president-elect may have limited room to maneuver if Republicans retain control of the Senate. Biden has pledged to spend trillions of dollars to speed up the transition from fossil fuels, slash emissions and curb climate change. Biden also has promised to ban new fracking on federal lands, which he may try to achieve via an executive order. Such a move would limit shale companiesâ operations in several states, including New Mexico. Bidenâs clampdown on emissions would reverse the Trump administrationâs relaxation of environmental regulations. That potentially raises costs for the oil and gas industry. -- Simon CaseyGOLD: The prospect of additional U.S. stimulus after the election could dent the dollar and raise the specter of inflation, giving a lift to goldâs status as a store of value. Two circumstances that helped push bullion to its record -- negative real yields and unprecedented liquidity provided by central banks and governments -- will be the main drivers to propel prices regardless of who becomes the next president, said Michael Cuggino, portfolio manager at Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds. -- Yvonne Yue LiSTEEL & ALUMINUM: These industries were a top priority for Trumpâs tariffs and trade policies, and tariffs probably wonât go away any time soon under Biden, who hasnât placed trade at the top of his first-actions list. Producers and consumers have adjusted for the 25% duty on steel imports and the 10% duty on aluminum, and removing them may alienate Midwesterners who helped elect Biden. It also would compel producers including U.S. Steel Corp., Century Aluminum Co. and the United Steelworkers union to lobby for protections. Itâs more likely Biden will keep the tariffs and embrace multilateral trade negotiations with key allies -- the E.U., Japan, Canada -- to oppose subsidized companies in China that produce more than half the worldâs steel and aluminum. Trump openly shunned multilateral trade partnerships, so this would be a big change in policy. -- Joe DeauxMONEY: Finance & Venture CapitalFINANCE: Bidenâs win could be good for Wall Street if he and lawmakers quickly pass a massive stimulus bill that boosts financial markets. But thereâs a big risk for banks, hedge funds and private-equity firms over time if Biden concedes to progressive Democratsâ demands that he appoint industry skeptics to key roles at the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission -- powerful entities that manage the economy and police trading. And Biden has pledged to rescind Trumpâs tax cuts, which have been a boon for banks. -- Jesse WestbrookVENTURE CAPITAL: Biden has said he will allocate $10 billion to state and local venture-capital programs, which should help bolster startups and their backers around the country. But in tax terms, VCs probably will end up taking a hit. Biden has promised to increase corporate taxes and eliminate a preferential treatment of capital gains -- the way most gains from venture funds are taxed -- for the richest Americans. If public-equity investors decide corporate earnings will decline under Biden and stock markets tumble, some startups may be encouraged to delay initial public offerings. -- Sarah McBrideFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ahead-under-president-joe-biden-203000344.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-04	2020-11-04 13:30:02	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Covid-Proofing Air Is a $10 Billion Opportunity	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When's the last time you actually thought about your office's air conditioner? Pre-pandemic, assuming it worked, probably never. Today? Probably a lot. AndÂ even once the coronavirus outbreaks have subsided and a vaccine is finally in hand, youâre probablyÂ still going to feel differently about the air youÂ breathe, especially indoors.Increased interest in filtration, disinfection and other tools forÂ improvingÂ the quality of indoor air will likely create a new revenue opportunity of multiple billions of dollars across the industry, Johnson Controls International Plc CEO George Oliver said on a call Tuesday to discuss the building-products companyâs most recent quarterly results. Johnson Controls alone is looking at potentialÂ projects in this vein worth âa couple of hundred millionâ for just next year, he said. That echoes commentary from rivals including Carrier Global Corp., whichÂ estimatesÂ the ultimate market for indoor air-quality improvements willÂ reachÂ about $10 billion, includingÂ $150 million of potential business opportunities the company has already identified for itself. Honeywell International Inc. cited a more thanÂ $600 million sales pipeline for its âhealthy buildingsâ offerings.Â Itâs in these companiesâ interest to tout this opportunity. Heating, ventilation and air conditioner (HVAC) systems have been a rare bright spot in an industrial sector thatâs struggled to inspire investors with third-quarter results that signaledÂ aÂ sureÂ but slowÂ recovery. Consumers have been snapping up new air conditioners amid a lockdown-inspired home-improvement wave, but even commercial landlordsÂ areÂ investing at a greater rate than expected as they try to lure peopleÂ back to offices, restaurants and retail space.Â There were fears that air conditioners were to blame for spikes in coronavirus cases as hot summer weather pushed people indoors. The reality is that these systems can be an effective tool in fighting off contagions â with some upgrades. These range from adding higher levels of filtration and allowing for more outside air flow to installing ultravioletÂ light disinfectant systems and digital-monitoring technology that lets building managers know if everything is working as it should. All of these cost money.Â âIt's something that everybody needs,â Honeywell CEO Darius Adamczyk said on a call to discuss third-quarter results last week.Â âAt least in the U.S. and some other parts of the world, people are not working in their workplace yet. But when they do come back, they do want to come back to a healthier environment. I think we're kind of hitting the spot there and the time to implement those solutions is now, not after people come back.âCarrier CEO Dave Gitlin pointed out that people spend a whopping 90% of their lives indoors on average, meaning that if you are 50 years old, youâve spent 45 yearsÂ sitting inside. That is bothÂ depressing and instructive. We may be more aware of our time inside after having enduredÂ lockdowns, but even in a pandemic-free future weâre still going to be breathing in an awful lot of indoor air. And it seems likely that after everything the world has been through, the average person is at least going to think twice about the quality of that air.Â This themeÂ fits hand in hand with a broader pivot toward sustainability in both the HVAC industry in particular and the manufacturing economy more broadly. A building thatâs helping the environment by releasing fewer greenhouse gases doesnât have the same appeal if the air within its four walls can be a (real or perceived) conduit for disease. What weâve learned is that our previous standards of air purification didnât hold up to the test of the pandemic and those need to evolve accordingly, Oliver of Johnson Controls said. After all,Â the coronavirus is unlikely to be the last novel pathogen the world encounters.Trane Technologies Plc estimates there areÂ 1.7 trillion square feet of building space around the world and that some 400 billion of that is non-residential, communal real estate. If all of that ultimately needs to be upgraded, well, you get the picture.Â This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

Honeywellâs 3Q Sales Drop 14% As Covid-19 Hurts Aircraft Demand	"Honeywell Internationalâs 3Q revenues fell 14% to $7.8 billion, reflecting weak demand across its multiple end markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower sales weighed on its bottom line as the diversified technology and manufacturing company's adjusted EPS fell 25% to $1.56 year-on-year.Nonetheless, the companyâs revenues and adjusted earnings per share managed to surpass Street estimates of $7.65 billion and $1.49 per share, respectively. Moreover, the company recorded sequential âimprovements in sales growth, margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share.â (See HON stock analysis on TipRanks).Honeywellâs (HON) aerospace division recorded the highest revenue decline of 25% due to lower commercial aircraft demand. Delays in building solutions projects and lower demand for building products led to a 8% decline in the company's building technologies segmentâs sales. Revenues at its performance materials and technologies unit declined 16% due to reduced demand.Meanwhile, the company saw an 8% improvement in safety and productivity solutionsâ revenues mainly âdriven by double-digit Intelligrated and personal protective equipment growth as well as a return to growth in productivity solutions and services, partially offset by lower gas sensing volumes.âFor 4Q, Honeywell expects revenues to land between $8.2 billion and $8.5 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 11%-14%. Adjusted EPS is forecasted to be in the range of $1.97-$2.02, down 2%-4% from the year-ago quarter. For the full year, sales are anticipated to fall 12%-13% and generate between $31.9 billion and $32.2 billion. The comany's adjusted EPS guidance range of $7-$7.05 implies a decline of 14%.Following its earnings release, Cowen & Co. analystÂ Gautam KhannaÂ reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $160 (3% downside potential). In a note to investors, Khanna wrote, âAdj. Q3 sales/EPS beat expectations as HON managed costs aggressively, and initial Q4 EPS is above Street on stronger cost controls. Aero A/M drop was 47% vs. Q2's 54%, & initial C21 color (sales growth at all segments; ""strong"" incrementals; balance sheet deployment potential) is fairly bullish.âCurrently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 4 Buys and 3 Holds. With shares down nearly 7% year-to-date, the averageÂ price targetÂ of $179.86 implies upside potential of 9% to current levels.Related News:  Activisionâs 3Q Profit Soars 132% On Strong Gaming Demand  Starbucks Tops 4Q Estimates, Sees Strong Global Comps In FY21  Columbia Sportswear Sinks 17% After Hours On Weak 3Q Earnings More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Marvell To Snap Up Inphi In $10B Chip Deal   * AstraZeneca Sells Rights To Hypertension Drugs For $400M   * Facebook Drops 6% on âUncertainâ 2021 Warning; J.P.

The sector is still 10.6% below its prior 2020 highs. Those were set in the first quarter of the year, before the novel coronavirus rattled the market.Â 
For what itâs worth, thatâs about average vs. the other industries and the overall market. The S&P 500 is down 7.3% from its highs, although it was able to set new highs even after the pandemic selloff.Â 
When considering the other 10 S&P 500 sectors, the industrial sector is in the top six when it comes to how far off its highs it is. With five sectors below it, the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLI) is in the middle of the pack.Â InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
When it comes to performance though, itâs in the bottom half.Â 
Over the past year, industrial stocks have lost over 4%. Thatâs better than three other groups. However, it lags seven other sectors, three of which have generated double-digit returns in that time.


					7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy for the Second Wave				

In the end, though, that doesnât matter. Industrial stocks have been around for centuries and they will be around for centuries more. Letâs look at seven industrial stocks that are worth buying now.Â

Industrial Stocks to Buy: Honeywell (HON)

Considered by many to be a best-in-breed industrial name, itâs hard to lead off a list of industrial stocks and not include Honeywell. Unfortunately, though, HON stock has kept pace with the sectorâs performance.Â 
Yet, despite a massive selloff in the markets lately, HON stock is only down 7% on the year. Considering that so much of the industrial sectorâs business is tied to the economy, things could look a lot worse.
In any regard, Honeywell has its feelers in all the right places.Â 
The company has made its living dominating areas such as aerospace and control panels. The latter are used for a lot of things, from machinery to thermostats. Over the years though, Honeywell has built on its offerings.Â 
It includes safety equipment, healthcare, pharma, manufacturing and supply chain management. For its buildings and city unit, the company states, âFrom skyscrapers to stadiums to shopping centers, drive connectivity, productivity and security for everyone in them.â
Further, Honeywell is expanding into the internet of things, or more specifically, the Industrial Internet of Things. For many investors, they like that HON stock is capitalizing on its legacy businesses, while also expanding into new frontiers.Â 
Plus, Honeywell pays out a 2.3% dividend yield.Â

Is there an industrial company better prepared to handle an influx in demand than UPS? Because of the pandemic, this logistics operator is now benefiting from a sharp rise in e-commerce sales.Â 
Thatâs right â itâs not just Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reaping revenue from our current situation. Big-box retailers, e-commerce venders and others have all seen an explosion in online sales. If you havenât had the time to go through last quarterâs earnings results, just look at information from the St. Louis Federal Reserve. It shows that online sales have made up a growing percentage of overall retail sales for years. But in 2020, that figure has exploded.
In any case, that has resulted in big-time business for UPS. Revenue is forecast to climb over 9% this year, but that may be conservative. In Q3, revenue ballooned 15.9% year over year to $21.2 billion. That smashed expectations by over $1 billion.Â

Unless you expect online sales to slow, UPS doesnât seem like a name to bet against. Itâs currently one of the stronger industrial stocks on the market.

The only reason some investors interested in industrial stocks may skip over UPS is to take a closer look at FedEx.Â 
What I love about FDX stock is the same thing I like about UPS: demand is simply overpowering the two companies. When customers canât get enough of a companiesâ goods and services, thatâs a great problem to have.Â 
Of course, one day, Amazonâs own delivery services may create a problem for FedEx and UPS. However, that problem is not one weâre seeing right now. FedEx is forecast to grow revenue by a similar amount to UPS this quarter, up 10.7%.Â 
Moreover, itâs the companyâs explosion in earnings that we should take notice of. Last quarter, earnings of $4.87 per share beat estimates by more than $2 a share.Â 
Consensus expectations â which may now prove conservative â call for 67% earnings growth this year. Thatâs not a one-year gain, followed by a reversion year, either. Analysts expect almost 10% growth next year, too.Â 
At the end of the day, shares trade at over 17.6 times this yearâs forward earnings. At the very least thatâs reasonable. One could even make the case that itâs cheap, given the secular trend in e-commerce sales and the earnings boom at FedEx.Â 

Boeing (BA)

Boeing is a bit of a controversial pick down here, isnât it? Of all the industrial stocks, this one has so many negative catalysts working against it that itâs hard to be excited.Â 
To be frank, shares are down 55% this year and down 67% from the all-time highs made in February 2019. Thatâs when Boeingâs second 737 MAX jet crashed, sending the company into a rabbit hole of headaches, controversy and losses.Â 
Throw in the fact that the aerospace industry has been ravished by the novel coronavirus, too, and many are wondering why Boeing would be a buy.Â 
So, why is it?
Boeing is one half of a duopoly on plane manufacturing. Between Boeing and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY), virtually all large jets are made by the two companies. And while BA stock may take a while to regain its crown, it canât go much lower from here. At least, from a business perspective.Â 
Add in that the U.S. government has a national interest in seeing Boeing survive (and really, thrive) as a defense contractor, and thereâs even less reason to worry about the companyâs liquidity.Â 
Further, the 737 MAX is making progress toward getting back into flight â although whether or not consumers accept the plane is another story. European regulators just gave it the green light. Boeing now waits on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). But by and large, the negatives are starting to fade away for Boeing, and its future is looking brighter.

Perhaps this one is still too risky for investors who want it at a lower price. But, to me, this looks like a buy-and-throw-it-in-the-bottom-drawer kind of situation â with a multi-year outlook.Â 

3M Co (MMM)
 Click to EnlargeSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com
	
When it comes to industrial stocks with dependable dividends, 3M is near the top of the list. The company kicks out a 3.7% yield. Thatâs more than four times the yield one will get with the 10-year Treasury bond.Â 
Better yet, MMM stock is also consistent in how often the dividend gets raised. 3M has not only paid, but has raised its annual payout for 61 consecutive years. Anytime a company has accomplished such a feat, itâs worth a look.Â 
On the downside, 3M is starved for growth. On the plus side, itâs not seeing its revenue take a big hit from the novel coronavirus. In fact, the company is doing considerable business in the healthcare and PPE fields. That has helped offset the slower growth its seeing in its other businesses.Â 
Revenue is forecast to fall less than 1% this year, while earnings are forecast to fall a little under 8%. However, in 2021, expectations call for 10% earnings growth, erasing 2020âs drop.Â 
Even as the pandemic rages on, the economy is moving in the right direction. And that will bode well for the company in 2021, particularly if its strong business units stay strong.Â 

Lockheed Martin (LMT)

Lockheed Martin is not among the quintessential industrial stocks. Thatâs because investors consider it more of a defense stock, which is true by industry but not by sector.Â 
In any regard, LMT stock seems to be presenting an opportunity. In mid-October, Lockheed reported earnings, delivering a top-line and bottom-line beat for Q3. In the third quarter, the company grew revenue by 10.2% and its earnings by 8.7%. Further, management upped its guidance.Â 
The company now expects earnings of roughly $24.45 a share vs. its prior outlook range of $23.75 to $24.05 per share. For revenue, management forecasts sales of $65.25 billion vs. a previous outlook range of $63.5 billion to $65 billion.Â 
Despite all that, on Oct. 20 shares fell 3% on earnings and another 1.4% in the following session.Â 
That leaves the stock trading at about 13.2 times this yearâs forward earnings. Lockheed is forecast to grow earnings by more than 11% this year and 6.7% next year and just reported a solid quarterly result. On top of that, it pays out a nearly 3% dividend yield.

To me, that sounds more like an opportunity than a red flag.Â 

Caterpillar (CAT)

Last but not least, it would be hard to leave Caterpillar off the list of top industrial stocks.Â 
While CAT stock is highly levered to the economy, weâre not seeing the type of breakdown typically associated with a deep global recession. In fact, shares are higher, up 5% in the past month after its rally.Â 
Why? Because itâs likely that some sort of infrastructure deal will eventually come to fruition. Whether itâs a Democrat or Republican-occupied White House, both sides have an incentive to put people to work with a big infrastructure bill.Â 
On top of that, most of the world is looking to get back to regular life. In some cases, thatâs merely a hope and not a plan. For others, though, construction, road work and other tasks needing heavy machinery will start back up. That makes 2021 a rebound year.Â 
These two catalysts should be a boon for Caterpillar â or at least, thatâs what the stock price is reflecting amid the current rally.Â

2020-10-30	2020-10-30 12:04:34	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	A Look Into Honeywell International's Debt	Shares of Honeywell International (NYSE: HON) moved higher by 10.64% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Honeywell International has.Honeywell International's Debt According to the Honeywell International's most recent financial statement as reported on July 24, 2020, total debt is at $22.09 billion, with $17.59 billion in long-term debt and $4.50 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $13.78 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $8.31 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Honeywell International has $63.60 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.35. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

Earnings Preview for Honeywell International	Honeywell International (NYSE: HON) announces its next round of earnings this Friday, October 30. Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Friday's Q3 earnings announcement.What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS.Earnings And Revenue Wall Street analysts see Honeywell International reporting earnings of $1.49 per share on revenue of $7.65 billion. In the same quarter last year, Honeywell International reported earnings per share of $2.08 on revenue of $9.09 billion.What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the &quot;consensus estimates.&quot; A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an &quot;earnings surprise&quot; and may move the stock by a considerable margin.View more earnings on HONThe analyst consensus estimate would represent a 28.37% decrease in the company's earnings. Sales would have fallen 15.8% from the same quarter last year. In comparison to analyst estimates in the past, here is how the company's reported EPS stacks up:Quarter Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2019  EPS Estimate 1.21 1.95 2.04 2.01  EPS Actual 1.26 2.21 2.06 2.08  Revenue Estimate 7.29 B 8.57 B 9.61 B 9.11 B  Revenue Actual 7.48 B 8.46 B 9.50 B 9.09 B  Stock Performance Over the past 52-week period, shares of Honeywell International have declined 8.87%.

The last presidential debate has come and gone, and itâs unlikely to have swayed a polarized voting public. Weâre now also just 12 days out from Election Day. The outcome remains rife with uncertainty. Unfortunately, thereâs also a strong chance of more political theater in the cards.
Itâs a different story on Wall Street, though. A critical vote was decided this past month. That referendum was bullish and is typically great for the market and for investing in Dow Jones stocks. Iâm referring to the historically significant and consistently strong follow-through day signal the major indices scored on Sept. 30.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Follow-through days, or FTDâs, are incredibly robust. No major market bottom has occurred without one in place. Still, the technically driven event isnât a guarantee of future profits. Just ask investors long DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG). The leading sport bettor outfit topped one day after the key market signal. While the broader market has climbed a couple percent in October, DKNG is off nearly 30%. A similar tale can be seen in recent hot-to-trot EV play Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS).
Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN)
Honeywell International (NYSE:HON)
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM)
To be fair, up-and-coming growth plays arenât alone in defying the marketâs most recent FTD. Even blue-chips arenât immune to pressure. IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are firmly in the red in October. And constituents Visa (NYSE:V), Chevron (NYSE:CVX) or Boeing (NYSE:BA) arenât exactly killing it either. With that in mind, letâs visit the price charts of this bellwetherâs newest recruits.

Dow Jones Stocks to Trade: Amgen (AMGN)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The first of our newly anointed Dow Jones stocks to trade right now is Amgen. The biotech giantâs long-term monthly chart reveals a stock thatâs been in an uptrend since the financial crisis of 2008â2009. But in 2020 shares are showing signs of topping.
Technically, a bearish divergence in AMGNâs stochastics as the stock formed a higher-high relative to last Decemberâs prior pivot top is a warning. Now, and with shares breaking beneath a three-month-long bearish-leaning consolidation pattern, this Dow Jones stockâs welcome mat looks to have disappeared.
Iâd recommend short exposure in Amgen using the March $210/$190 bear put spread for protection. This strategy will help bears get through next Wednesday nightâs earnings event with less financial and mental stress in anticipation of a larger correction towards trend support going into 2021.

Honeywell International (HON)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The next of our Dow Jones stocks to trade is Honeywell. Technically, the diversified technology and manufacturing outfit has been a workhorse within the bellwether. And thereâs little to suggest HON stock canât continue rallying to new highs.
Honeywellâs earnings are a week from today. The observation is HONâs V-shaped monthly base will see the stock break out to new highs in the reportâs aftermath. Backing that view, stochastics are trending nicely higher within neutral territory. Also, shares of Honeywell are demonstrating relative strength and positioned less than 3% from the patternâs all-time-high. In total, this is one Dow Jones stock thatâs making the rights moves.


					7 Gambling Stocks That Will Eventually Go on a Winning Streak				

To take advantage of an earnings catalyst, but also limit downside exposure through the quarterly release and Novemberâs political theater, Iâm bullish on the shorter-term Nov $180/$185 call vertical.

Salesforce.com (CRM)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The last of our Dow Jones stocks to trade is business software behemoth Salesforce.com. As with the election, Iâm torn when it comes to CRMâs price chart and how Iâd like to see the stock play out.
On the one hand, a steep and likely unsustainable rally since Marchâs Covid-19 double-bottom is at risk. Shares of Salesforce put together an overbought monthly doji decision candlestick in September. Itâs the kind of technical evidence which could mark the end of a bullish cycle in CRM and the start of a larger corrective move. Or maybe not?
Alternatively, if 2020 and the past four years have proven anything, itâs that anything, including more momentum, is possible. And as a Dow Jones stock thatâs first and foremost a blue-chip tech stock in a hot space, that shouldnât be ignored.
With a week to go in October for a full monthly candle to form, price action shaping up as an inside consolidation and earnings a full month out, my advice is to wait until November to cast your bullish or bearish ballot in CRM stock.

2020-10-12	2020-10-12 13:58:47	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	A Look Into Honeywell International's Debt	Shares of Honeywell International (NYSE: HON) moved higher by 14.52% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Honeywell International has.Honeywell International's Debt According to the Honeywell International's most recent balance sheet as reported on July 24, 2020, total debt is at $22.09 billion, with $17.59 billion in long-term debt and $4.50 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $13.78 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $8.31 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Honeywell International's $63.60 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.35. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Honeywell International's Debt Overview(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-08	2020-10-08 18:52:21	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Google Readies Cheaper Nest Thermostat With Hand Gesture Control	(Bloomberg) -- Google is preparing to launch a $129 Nest Thermostat with hand gesture controls, its most aggressively priced offering to date in the smart home thermostat market, according to people familiar with the plans.The new model is set to go on sale in coming weeks. The lower price compares with $249 for Nestâs flagship thermostat and the $169 Nest Thermostat E. Like that cheaper model, the new version will have a plastic casing instead of the metal design of the high-end version.Google is also replacing some touch-based controls with a new technology that relies on hand gestures, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private details. The new thermostat will include a sensor similar to the Soli system included in last yearâs Google Pixel 4 phone. The component reads a userâs hand gestures, so they can swipe their hand up or down near the device to control the temperature or move their hand toward or away to navigate menus. A Google spokesperson declined to comment.Read more: Google Abandons Apple, Samsung Rivalry With New 5G Pixel PhonesThe new thermostat continues Googleâs recent strategy of offering lower priced hardware. Last year, it started launching cheaper Pixel phones. This year, the company lowered the specifications of its flagship Pixel phone and is pricing the Pixel 5 at $699, a $100 drop from the Pixel 4. It also recently priced a new Nest Audio speaker at $99, below some competing products.The Google hardware division is under pressure to show results that benefit the companyâs bottom line after hundreds of millions of dollars in development costs.At $129, the thermostat may compete better with rivals from Honeywell and Ecobee and could potentially serve as a way to introduce new customers to Google hardware products.Google acquired Nest in 2014 and for years kept it as a standalone company under parent Alphabet Inc. In 2018, Nest was integrated into Googleâs larger hardware division and last year the company started merging Nest and Google accounts to unify its smart home strategy.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-readies-cheaper-nest-thermostat-185221469.html?.tsrc=rss

Based on the company's closing price on Friday, the new annual dividend implies a yield of 2.3%. It marks the 11th consecutive year in which the software-industrial company has ramped up its dividend.Honeywell International (HON) said that the new dividend will be effective in the fourth quarter, and the quarterly dividend of $0.93 per share will be payable on Dec. 4 to shareholders of record on Dec. 13.In July, Honeywell posted stronger-than-expected 2Q earnings of $1.26 per share, in comparison to analystsâ expectations of $1.21. Its revenues of $7.48 billion also beat the Street estimates of $7.29 billion. However, both earnings and revenues declined 40% and 19.1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis due to a 26% decline in aerospace sales related to Boeing's 737 MAX delays and weak demand for commercial aircraft. (See HON stock analysis on TipRanks).On Aug. 11, RBC Capital analyst Deane Dray cut the stock to Hold from Buy and slashed the price target to $158 (2.2% downside potential) from $166. Dray noted that the company has lagged in a cyclical rebound as it remains ""in the throes"" of an extended downturn in both its commercial aerospace and oil and gas businesses. The analyst added that the commercial airline and oil and gas sectors pose challenges in 40% of Honeywell's end markets. He believes that the valuation is ""undemanding hereâ amid few catalysts in the near term.Currently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock.

2020-09-24	2020-09-24 17:43:02	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Garrett Motion Bondholders Said to Discuss Rival Bankruptcy Loan	(Bloomberg) -- Junior creditors to auto-parts maker Garrett Motion Inc. are preparing a rival proposal to provide the bankrupt company with financing for its restructuring, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The group of bondholders organized and is in the process of hiring investment bank Moelis & Co. to represent them in the case and submit an offer for a debtor-in-possession loan, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. The group is getting legal advice from Ropes & Gray, Bloomberg previously reported.Garrett filed bankruptcy this week, struggling to deal with a pandemic-related slowdown in business on top of asbestos liability reimbursements it owes to its former parent Honeywell International Inc. The payments Garrett owes to Honeywell relate to asbestos claims stemming from Honeywellâs old Bendix brake business.Representatives for Garrett and Moelis declined to comment.The original $250 million bankruptcy financing package that Switzerland-based Garrett proposed was attacked by shareholders and Honeywell, in part because it contained deadlines that could rush a potential $2.1 billion sale to KPS Capital Partners. The deal had the support from holders of 61% of its outstanding senior secured debt but didnât include a plan to resolve the asbestos liabilities, which sit behind other forms of debt in line for repayment.A potential DIP from the bondholder group would also be around $250 million, the people said, but could be longer-term financing and remove milestones tied to a potential sale of the company.Honeywell objected to the KPS deal in a court hearing Monday, saying it would relieve Garrett of its responsibility for the asbestos payments, and Garrett agreed to consider a rival financing deal submitted by Oaktree Capital Management and Centerbridge Partners.The two investment firms are seeking the support of Honeywell for their proposed bankruptcy loan as they consider making a bid for Garrettâs assets, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Oaktree and Centerbridge aim to cut a deal with Honeywell to resolve Garrettâs $1.3 billion in disputed asbestos liabilities and win the conglomerateâs approval for their bid.A final DIP loan must be approved by the court and gain support from Garrettâs senior and junior creditors.The case is Garrett Motion Inc., 20-12212, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York.

2020-09-23	2020-09-23 15:04:57	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Garrett Motion Creditors Seek Honeywell Support for Rival Loan	(Bloomberg) -- Oaktree Capital Management and Centerbridge Partners are seeking the support of Honeywell International Inc. for their proposed Garrett Motion Inc. bankruptcy loan as they consider making a bid for the assets of the bankrupt auto supplier.The two investment firms would aim to cut a deal with Honeywell to resolve Garrettâs $1.3 billion in disputed asbestos liabilities and win the conglomerateâs approval for their bid, according to people familiar with the plans.Honeywell hasnât yet indicated its position, and other creditors may pitch additional proposals, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing confidential plans. Garrett looks attractive to many potential buyers or investors, they said, as its finances are largely stable apart from the asbestos liability overhang.Garrett filed bankruptcy this week, in part because of asbestos reimbursements owed to Honeywell, its former parent. Honeywell objected to a proposed bid from KPS Capital Partners at a court hearing Monday, saying the deal would relieve Garrett of its responsibility for the asbestos payments. Garrett said at that hearing it would consider Oaktree and Centerbridgeâs competing loan proposal, which could put them in prime position to ultimately own Garrett.Asbestos OverhangAuto-parts maker Garrett was part of Honeywell until its 2018 spinoff, and blames the firmâs asbestos-related liabilities for helping put it into bankruptcy this week. Making a deal with Honeywell to resolve those claims would provide a potential bidder with an upper hand in the companyâs bankruptcy auction process, the people said.Garrett sought bankruptcy protection Sunday with a plan to sell itself to private equity firm KPS for $2.1 billion. The reimbursements Garrett owes to Honeywell relate to asbestos claims stemming from Honeywellâs old Bendix brake business. The proposal had the support from holders of 61% of its outstanding senior secured debt but didnât include a plan to resolve the asbestos liabilities, which sit behind other forms of debt in line for repayment.Representatives for Garrett Motion, Honeywell, Oaktree and Centerbridge declined or didnât respond to requests for comment.Expedited SaleThe plan was attacked in court by shareholders and Honeywell, in part because it contained deadlines they said would expedite the sale to New York-based KPS. Honeywell attorney Nicole L. Greenblatt of Kirkland & Ellis claimed the loan and the bankruptcy case were being rushed so Garrett could get out of the debt it owes its former parent.Read More: Garrett Shareholders Force Firm to Look at New Bankruptcy LoanGarrettâs plan to sell itself to KPS in bankruptcy may be âambitiousâ given the objections from Honeywell and other parties, Negisa Balluku of Bloomberg Intelligence wrote in a report Tuesday.Garrett, based in Switzerland, sued over the asbestos agreement in 2019, accusing Honeywell of âsaddling Garrett with unconscionable and illegal covenants.â Honeywell has said the suit has no merit. Asbestos is a potent cause of malignancies, including a deadly form of lung cancer.KPS specializes in manufacturing companies. Targets have included Briggs & Stratton Corp., the bankrupt maker of landscaping equipment, as well as the Baker Hughes Co.âs oil pump business and Humvee maker AM General.The case is Garrett Motion Inc., 20-12212, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York.

2020-09-21	2020-09-21 14:58:41	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	How Blacklisting Companies Became a Trade War Weapon	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.Â Sign up here.Â Tariffs arenât the only weapon in a trade war. Countries are also turning to blacklists to restrict the economic activities of certain foreign companies. While such measures are often described as necessary to preserve national security, theyâre increasingly being deployed as policy tools to gain leverage in trade negotiations. In the case of the U.S. and China, disputes over human rights or geopolitics also can play a role.1&#92;. Who is using blacklists?President Donald Trump has placed dozens of Chinese companies on the U.S. Commerce Departmentâs âentity listâ -- a classification that restricts their ability to purchase U.S. software and components. Chinaâs government has said itâs developing a blacklist of its own, targeting foreign companies, organizations and people it calls âunreliable entities.â Export powerhouses Japan and South Korea also have deployed trade restrictions in a renewal of a long feud dating back to Japanâs colonization of the Korean peninsula in the early 20th century.2&#92;. Who is on the U.S. list?The most prominent among those blacklisted, primarily on national security grounds, is Huawei Technologies Co., the telecommunications giant at the forefront of fifth-generation, or 5G, mobile technology. Another 28 Chinese companies were blacklisted for alleged human rights violations against Uighur Muslims in Chinaâs far west Xinjiang province. Those companies include two of the worldâs largest manufacturers of video surveillance products, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co., and a pair of artificial-intelligence companies, SenseTime Group Ltd. and Megvii Technology Ltd.3&#92;. What does it mean to be blacklisted by the U.S.?Those on the U.S. entity list are prohibited from doing business with American companies without first obtaining a U.S. government license. The list was created in 1997 as a way to sanction companies that helped build weapons of mass destruction. Itâs since been expanded to cover activities considered âcontrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.â Targets can be âbusinesses, research institutions, government and private organizations, individuals, and other types of legal persons,â according to the Commerce Departmentâs Bureau of Industry and Security, which administers the list as part of U.S. Export Administration Regulations.4&#92;. How is China responding?By developing its own list of âunreliable entities,â which are countries, companies or people defined as having âseverely damaged the legitimate interestsâ of Chinese firms by failing to obey market rules, violating contracts or blocking or cutting off supply for noncommercial reasons. Those on the list may be subject to penalties such as trade restrictions, investment bans, visa restrictions and fines. They can apply to be removed from the list. Those targeted for the list may be given a grace period to rectify their alleged transgressions.5&#92;. Who is on Chinaâs list?China hasnât named anyone yet, but there are plenty of possible targets. HSBC Holdings Plc could make the list because of its participation in the U.S. investigation of Huawei. FedEx Corp. has been under scrutiny after China accused it of mis-routing some parcels sent by Huawei. Chinese state media has raised the specter of backlash against U.S. companies including General Dynamics Corp. and Honeywell International Inc. in connection with a proposed $2 billion U.S. arms sale to Taiwan. China also vowed retaliation against U.S. companies participating in a proposed $8 billion U.S. sale of Lockheed Martin Corp. F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan. China also has pledged to retaliate against Trumpâs sanctions related to human rights violations.6&#92;. What explains the increased use of blacklists?Itâs part of what trade hawks in China and the U.S. see as a generational fight for technological and economic supremacy of the 21st century. The Chinese government has leveraged its massive state resources to support industrial policies like âMade in China 2025,â and a 2017 development strategy that aims to make China the worldâs primary artificial intelligence innovation center by 2030. The Trump administration, backed by many in Congress, views this as a threat to Americaâs economic and national security and has actively sought to curb Chinaâs technological ambitions.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blacklisting-companies-became-trade-war-145841799.html?.tsrc=rss

Garrett Files For Bankruptcy Protection Amid Fallout With Honeywell	Switzerland-based auto-parts manufacturer Garrett Motion Inc (NYSE: GTX) has voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and proposed a $2.1 billion sale of its business to KPS Capital Partners, LP.What Happened: In less than two years of listing as a public company -- post spinoff from former parent Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) -- Garrett Motion has voluntarily filed for bankruptcy protection to protect capital and long-term business sustainability.The coronavirus pandemic has hit the company's sales as U.S. car manufacturers have slowed production and burned through cash.Garrett also took over significant liabilities during the spinoff in the form of payments to victims of asbestos exposure arising from Honeywell's Bendix division. Last year, Garrett had sued Honeywell, seeking to negotiate asbestos indemnity.&quot;Although the fundamentals of our business are strong and we have continued to try to develop our business strategy, the financial strains of the heavy debt load and liabilities we inherited in the spin-off from Honeywell - all exacerbated by COVID-19 - have created a significant long-term burden on our business,&quot; Garrett President and CEO Olivier Rabiller said.Garrett has tapped private-equity KPS Capital Partners as a stalking-horse bid to acquire the company's assets for $2.1 billion following its chapter 11 filing.Why It's Important: The unusual imposition of a 30-year indemnification agreement by Honeywell, immediately prior to the spinoff, pressured the finances of Garrett.A Honeywell spokeswoman on Sunday said that Garrett has filed for bankruptcy for the &quot;single, improper purpose of avoiding the legitimate and reasonable financial commitments&quot; to Honeywell, reports the Wall Street Journal.&quot;Garrett always has been capable of fulfilling those obligations with the assets it received in the spin-off,&quot; said Honeywell.Lenders holding 61% of senior secured debt support the restructuring agreement to boost the balance sheet. Garrett seeks a $250 million debtor-in-possession financing facility from KPS and a syndicate of top banks, pending approval from the bankruptcy court.Price Action: Garrett's shares fell 16% on Friday to close at $2.01 and have fallen 80% year-to-date.See more from Benzinga  * E-Commerce, Leadership, Blockchain: Why Wedbush Is Turning Bullish On Overstock  * BP Calls Out Oil Demand Peak, OPEC Cuts 2021 Outlook  * History Repeats Itself At Facebook As It Launches Campus Feature(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-11	2020-09-11 10:00:42	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Apple's Rising Class of LeadersÂ Will Shape a Post-Tim CookÂ Era	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and his top deputies are focusing greater attention on developing a new generation of leaders to eventually run some of the iPhone makerâs most important divisions such as hardware development, services and marketing.As Cook begins his 10th year at the helm, his management group is filled mostly with senior vice presidents who have worked at Apple for more than two decades, made tens of millions of dollars and are at or near the ages of 55Â to 60 when many previous executives have stepped aside. That, along with typical corporate planning, has spurred the Cupertino, California-based company to cultivate its next class of top managers, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified talking about internal company discussions. Apple declined to comment.Cook, who took over from Steve Jobs in August 2011,Â has led Apple to become the worldâs most valuable company and the first in the U.S. with a market capitalization that topped $2 trillion. Even with the companyâs success, the next group of leadersÂ will need to navigate rising global antitrust concerns, build stronger relationships with app developers, reduce the reliance on Chinese manufacturing and find devices or new services to carry the company beyond the iPhone.The CEO has given no indication heâs ready toÂ retire, but if the 59-year-old Cook moved onÂ tomorrow, look no further than Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, 57, to take over. Williams is seen as the heir apparent, having run the companyâsÂ global operations under CookÂ for the past several years. In 2013, he took over development of the Apple Watch and Appleâs health initiatives, and last year, added oversight of hardware and software design.Â Read more:Â Appleâs Heir Apparent Is Much More Like Tim Cook Than Steve JobsIn many ways, Williams is seen as pragmatic as Cook and as someone who wouldn't letÂ the companyÂ miss a beat. He is an operations-focused executive like Cook rather thanÂ a product visionary like Jobs or former design chief Jony Ive. With the companyâs decade of success under Cook, itâs unlikely theÂ board would want to shift away from thisÂ proven formula.Â Below, Bloomberg takes a look at possible successors to the current executives in charge of each major Apple division.Â Marketing:Greg Joswiak, 56, took over for Phil Schiller as Appleâs senior vice president of worldwide marketing in August, but Schiller, 60, had been gradually handing off some responsibility for years,Â according to people familiar with the transition.Â At Apple, the product marketing organization is broader than ads, as the group helps choose which features to add to devicesÂ and helps manageÂ product development.Â JoswiakÂ joined Apple in the 1980s, and is just about three years younger than his semi-retired predecessor. TheÂ company has a list of potential successors to Joswiak, with the âsmart moneyâ being on newly appointed vice presidentÂ of iPhone marketing Kaiann Drance, 42,Â to eventually take over, according to a person close to the company.Â Other potential contenders include Stan Ng and Susan Prescott. Ng,Â vice president of Apple Watch marketing, has been a mainstay in Appleâs marketing organization since the late 1990s, starting off on the Mac, transitioning to the iPod, and then working on the iPhone before the Watch.Â Prescott, 55,Â oversees marketing for apps and enterprise.Software Engineering:Craig Federighi, 51, is the youngest member of Appleâs executive teamÂ and is likely to remain in his role for several more years. But ifÂ he stepped down, Federighi has at least two key lieutenants thatÂ could fill the role.Â Sebastien Marineau-Mes, vice president of Intelligent Systems Experience, and Jon Andrews, who was named a vice president in charge of CoreOS last year,Â are seen by people close to Apple as most likely to be promotedÂ if necessary.AndrewsâsÂ CoreOS is the most fundamental component of Appleâs operating systems, the layer that handles underlying features like wireless networking and the file system.Â Marineau-Mes used to hold Andrewsâs role, but in 2016 was movedÂ to oversee the Photos and Camera apps in addition to system security. More recently, Marineau-MesÂ was shifted toÂ workÂ on features like the new iOS 14 widgets.Â Marineau-Mes was hired away from BlackBerry Ltd. in 2014Â after running the Canada-basedÂ companyâs software division, andÂ Andrews joined Apple in 2006.Services:Services are one of Appleâs fastest growingÂ segments and a key driver for device sales. Eddy Cue, 55, was named the senior vice president of the unit in 2011.Â Cue, who has worked more than 30 years at Apple, started at the companyÂ byÂ managing customer service teams and now oversees Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, Apple Maps, many of the applications that run on the companyâs devicesÂ andÂ dealmaking forÂ content.Â As for Cueâs eventual successor, Peter Stern, 48, is at the top of the short list.Stern, who joined Apple from Time Warner Cable in 2016, is a content dealmaker. HeÂ oversees the business side of Appleâs video efforts and leads work onÂ Apple News, Apple Books, iCloudÂ and theÂ company's advertising platforms. He also helped handleÂ the development of Appleâs upgraded TV app last year and is leading the charge on Appleâs push into services bundles.Â Operations:Appleâs operations division is perhaps the companyâs most important. TheÂ team is responsible for cranking out hundreds of millions of devices fromÂ Asia and shipping them across the world. The group also mustÂ developÂ manufacturing techniques, sourceÂ componentsÂ and strikeÂ deals with suppliers.Â Cook ran Appleâs operations before handing over that responsibility toÂ Williams. Last year, Apple tapped Sabih Khan, 54, as senior vice president of operations. BeyondÂ Khan,Â Apple has a team of several veterans such asÂ operations executives Dan Rosckes, Rob YorkÂ andÂ Rory Sexton.But the most likely long-termÂ successor, according to people familiar with the group, is Priya Balasubramaniam, head of operations for the iPhone.Â BalasubramaniamÂ has been in her current role since 2014 and joined Apple nearly 20 years ago. She is in charge of the production, supply chainÂ and repair network for Appleâs most important product as well as underlying components.In 2017, Balasubramaniam helped fix development challenges with the iPhone Xâs facial recognition sensor at facilities in South Korea. The phone ended up shipping in time for the holiday season and helped lead to strong overall sales.Hardware Engineering:Dan Riccio, 57,Â has run Appleâs hardware engineering division sinceÂ 2012 and oversees the hardware development of almostÂ every Apple device.Â The group has several vice presidents who runÂ different areas, but John Ternusâs profile inside and outside of the company has steadily risen over the past several years. As a top lieutenant to Riccio, Ternus, 45,Â is in charge of hardware engineering for the iPad and Mac. He also contributes to the development of several other products.Â A person who knows Ternus called himÂ a well-respected manager whoÂ understands the technology, and despite his rising profile, has remained unassuming âÂ all characteristics of aÂ potential future division head or even CEO.TernusÂ recently supervisedÂ the development of the new iPad Pro design, an increasedÂ focus on the Mac after the company let several lines languishÂ and has been key in the companyâs transition from IntelÂ Corp. to its own Mac processors.Â Hardware Technologies:JohnyÂ Sroujiâs Hardware Technologies group has increasingly become one of Appleâs most important assets. His teamâs chips have powered the iPhone, iPad, and Apple WatchÂ with performance outpacing many rivals. The group is also developing chips at the core of Appleâs upcoming augmented-reality headset and glasses, cellular modems for future iPhonesÂ and processorsÂ to replace those from Intel in Macs.Â Srouji, 55, joined Apple in 2008Â and was appointed to Appleâs executive team in 2015. He is a demanding leader who keeps a tight grip on a team that has a rising profile inÂ theÂ chip industry.Â None of his direct reports are seen as having Sroujiâs clout to run such a demanding division. Still, Sribalan Santhanam, 54, isÂ most likely to take the role if Srouji were to step down or retire, people close to the company said.Santhanam, the companyâs vice president of Silicon Engineering, joined Apple in 2008 when his previous employer P.A. Semi, was acquired to kickstart Appleâs in-house chip efforts. His profile has risen lately after he announced the iPhone 11âs processor and was one of the showmen of Appleâs Mac processor transition.Retail &Â Human Resources:When Angela Ahrendts left her post as Appleâs retail chief last year, Tim Cook tried something new: promoting an insider to the job. Cookâs first choiceÂ as head of retail in 2012, John Browett, cameÂ from the outside and clashed with a culture of customer service, which triggeredÂ his departure after less than a year. While Ahrendts revamped the look and operations of stores, some employees and customers werenât pleased with the changes.Â Read more:Â How the Apple Store Lost Its LusterSince taking over last year,Â Deirdre OâBrien has pushed Apple retail online amid the Covid-19 pandemic and navigated opening and shuttingÂ locations on an ad hoc basis. If OâBrien, 54, were to step down from her post as head of retail and human resources, Apple has a bench of lieutenants in place to take over.Â The company could consider again splitting the role into two positions, such as promoting a retail leader of a major geographyÂ in addition to having a standalone human resources executive. Apple could also look to hire an outsiderÂ as it did before.Â Chief Financial Officer,Â General CounselÂ and Machine Learning:Â About a year before the retirement of previous Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer in 2014, Apple hired current CFO Luca Maestri, 56, away from Xerox Corp.Â He served as corporate controller and vice president of finance before taking the CFO job. If Maestri were to leave Apple,Â itâs possible the company could once again look for an outsider to take the job. It could also considerÂ Saori Casey, its current vice president of finance, who oversees the companyâs books and is responsible for putting together earnings reports.Â The company has also hired outsiders for its past two general counsels: the current holder of the job Kate Adams, 56, came from Honeywell, while her predecessor, Bruce Sewell, joined from Intel.Â Appleâs senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy role was created specifically for John Giannandrea, 55, who earlierÂ held a similar job at Google. Giannandrea does not have a clear top lieutenant, so if he were to depart Apple, itâs unclear who would replace him or if Apple would fold the unit back into the Software Engineering department.Â For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-rising-class-leaders-shape-100042248.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-09	2020-09-09 12:30:39	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Why Are N95 Masks Still So Difficult to Get?	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last week â which is to say, six months into a pandemic that has killedÂ more than 185,000 Americans â the American Nurses Association released the results of a survey of its membership. The survey asked whether nurses were still experiencing shortages of personal protective equipment, or PPE.The answer was a resounding yes. âA thirdÂ reportedÂ that they were out of or short of N95 respirators designed to offer maximum protection in a hospital setting,â according to Bloomberg News. (They are called N95s because they filter out 95% of airborne particulates, including viruses.)Early in the pandemic, N95 masks were in such short supply that hospital personnel were reusing them for days at a time instead of following the proper protocol of discarding them after a single use. Today, that is still the case; almost 60% of the nurses surveyed said theyâreÂ âre-using single-use protective equipment for five or more days, and 68% said their facilities mandate re-using the supplies,â Bloomberg reported.When I emailed a top hospital administrator to ask whether mask shortages had eased up, she sent me a one-line reply: âSupply chain is still royally screwed up, and canât get N95s.âHow can this be? The initial shortage of N95s in March and April was more or less understandable. According to 3M Co., the biggest mask maker in the U.S., demand for N95s didnât just double or triple in the wake of the pandemic; it rose 40-fold. Hospitals needed them, but so did dental offices, long-term care facilities, Covid-19 testing sites and many other facilities.Â The effort to acquire N95s became a mad scramble. The supply chain collapsed. âBrokersâ(1) popped up everywhere, claiming to have access to millions of masks, supposedly stored in warehouses in Los Angeles or Guangzhou or Seoul. Usually, these claims were bogus, but even when they werenât, obtaining those masks was extraordinarily difficult, with dozens of brokers all promising to deliver the same masks. The market was filled with fakes. Oil traders and hedge funds jumped in, trading masks as if they were oil futures. The price for many masks shot up from around $1 to as much as $5 or $6. Meanwhile, 3M â which has not raised its prices during the pandemic â ramped up production from 22 million N95s a month before the pandemic to 50 million by June. It wasnât nearly enough.Today, 3Mâs U.S. run rate is 1 billion N95s a year. Worldwide, it expects to be churning them out at a rate of 2 billion a year by the end of 2020. The company has also imported tens of millions of N95s from its facilities in China under an agreement with President Donald Trump, who invoked the Defense Production Act. Honeywell International Inc. is also manufacturing N95s for the U.S. market, as are a handful of other companies.Â Still, hospitals and other entities, including state governments, are having nearly as much difficulty obtaining N95s as they did early in the pandemic. The scarcity has not eased. The N95 black market is still going strong. States are still bidding against one another for mask supplies. Counterfeits and substandard masks are still being sold as the real thing (although 3M has worked hard to rid the market of bogus 3M masks). The only reason this isnât a bigger issue is that the influx of Covid-19 hospital patients has eased. But if the pandemic has a second wave in the fall, as many fear, itâs going to get ugly again.Consider the situation in Minnesota. The state has orders for more than 5 million N95s, which it hopes to allocate to hospitals thatÂ need them. According to the Star Tribune in Minneapolis, it has received only 337,000 masks so farÂ through traditional 3M distributors.Â Minnesota contracted with Supply Link Inc., a small Ohio company, for an additional 2 million N95s, for which it agreed to pay $4.75 each â or $9.5 million in total. Matthew Kaspar, SupplyÂ Linkâs president, told me that the company had lined up the purchase, signed a sales agreement and found financiers to front the down payment, which the state was prevented from doing by law. âI actually had Minnesota on the phone with the so-called distributor,â said Melissa Hill, the Supply Link executive in charge of the deal. The distributor assured state officials that it was all on the up-and-up.It wasnât. When four trucks were sent to the warehouse that supposedlyÂ held the masks, Supply Link discovered it was barren. âThis is a very dark market,â Hill said. The companyâs experience is typical of the scams that are taking place in the N95 black market. Wayne Waslaski, an official with the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, told me that he now thinks it is unlikely the state will ever see those 2 million masks. But Hill and Kaspar insist that they wonât stop trying to unearth them.Â Minnesota does know where an additional 500,000 N95 masks reside: in a warehouse in China, where they have been tied up for more than three months. The hangup? The U.S. government, which has refused to allow them to be imported. Which gets to the ultimate cause of the problem: the Trump administration.When you get right down to it, it will be years before the enormous gap between the supply of N95s and demand will narrow in the U.S. Before the pandemic, hospitals didnât use them much, not even for most surgical procedures; a typical hospital might go through a few thousand a month, rather than the hundreds of thousands it now needs monthly. Globalization pushed most mask manufacturing overseas âand once the virus arrived, few countries were willing to allow N95s to be exported. And with such a severe supply shortage, it was inevitable that black marketers and scam artists would try to take advantage of people who needed to buy masks. None of this is surprising; markets donât function properly when supply and demand are so out of whack.What needed to happen in March â and still needs to happen â is the federal government should be using the Defense Production Act to take control of the N95 market. It alone has the power to negotiate mask deals with countries like China and Vietnam. It could have sent an important message by punishing price gougers and counterfeiters. It could have enlisted other civic-minded companies besides 3M to begin manufacturing N95s. And it could have allocated N95s (and other PPE for that matter) to states and hospitals and nursing homes as they were needed â shifting mask shipments away from states where coronavirus cases were on the wane and toward emerging hot spots.Â  A competent federal effort wouldnât have ended the supply-demand imbalance, but it could have drastically reduced its effect on the country.The Federal Emergency Management Agency insists that it has done just that, but the effort has been paltry. Minnesota, for instance, has received a pathetic 3,000 masks from the federal government. Whatâs more, as the Associated Press pointed out in July, âlow population, mostly rural statesâ â i.e. red states â did better by FEMA than more populous states that were hit harder by the virus. âFor example, Montana has received 1,125 items of protective gear per [confirmed Covid-19] case, compared with 32 items per case in Massachusetts, an early hot spot,â the AP wrote. A FEMA spokesperson said that PPE was âdistributed evenlyâ to the states.But the federal government has also hijacked for its own stockpile imported masks that hospitals had already paid for. It has stood aside as the market for N95s devolved into the Wild West. And the FDA, in particular, has made it extremely difficult to import even bona fide N95 masks that were madeÂ abroad.Donaldson Company Inc., a filtration company based in the Minneapolis suburbs, is the company trying to bring in those 500,000 masks from China. It has state-of-the-art air-filtration labs scattered around the world, including in China. Though the company had no experience with N95s, it raised its hand to help Minnesota source them. Scam artists in China swarmed all over the company, and early on, it used its labs mainly to detect fraudulent N95s. âWe likely saved the state millions of dollars by screening out the procurement of bad masks,â its CEO, Tod Carpenter,Â told me.Eventually, Donaldson found a legitimate manufacturer in ChinaÂ and set up a supply chain. The company then purchased 500,000 high-quality masks that they believed met the emergency authorization requirements the FDA had established to deal with the pandemic. Those were the masks Donaldson intended to sell to the state â at cost, Carpenter said.Â After testing them â and confirming that the Chinese company had the necessary registration from its government â Donaldson applied to the FDA to have them brought into the U.S. The agency said no; the application had to come from the manufacturer. The Chinese company then submitted an application directly. Again the FDA said no because its registration was temporary. When the Chinese company got its permanent registration, it tried one more time. Guess what? The FDA still said no.Â âWeâre scratching our heads here,â Carpenter told me. âWeâre a filter company. We have labs. We know how to do this. Just tell us what we need to do.â But the FDA wonât talk to Carpenter because under its rules, it can only discuss such matters with the manufacturer, not the distributor. Although Donaldson is still trying to find ways to make its case to the FDA, itâs a stalemate.During the Republican convention, Trump boasted about shipping âhundreds of millions of masks, gloves and gowns to our frontline health care workers.â Having now spent time digging into the world of PPE, I find the following account more credible. It took place in Rhode Island a few months ago, after Governor Gina Raimondo pleaded with FEMA for hospital gear from the federal stockpile.âIâd just constantly get the runaround,â she recounted to Politico.Â  She continued: âOne time they promised me, âOK, it will be there today, a truck full of PPE.â I said: âTell me the time, Iâll check on it myself.â They said 7 p.m. Great. At 7 p.m., no truck. I call and ask where is it, they say 9 p.m. Fine. Around 9 p.m., I get a text from FEMA: Governor, the truck arrived. Hallelujah! I called my director of health. âGreat news, the truck is finally here!ââÂ Then they opened the truck. It was empty.(1) One such broker was Brian Kolfage, the decorated veteran who lost both legs and an arm in Iraq in 2004. Last month, he was among those indicted, along with Steve Bannon and two others, by the Department of Justice, which accused them of diverting money that had been raised to build a wall at the Mexican border for personal uses.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2020-08-25	2020-08-25 21:28:36	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Oil, Gasoline Climb to Five-Month Highs With Hurricane Nearing	(Bloomberg) -- Crude and gasoline futures both climbed to levels not seen since before the pandemic as Hurricane Laura rattled toward a key stretch of the U.S. Gulf Coast that is home to the nationâs greatest concentration of refining capacity.U.S. gasoline futures jumped 2.1% and crude futures added 1.7% Tuesday, bringing both contracts to the highest since early March. The storm is expected to make landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday along the Texas-Louisiana coast as a Category 3 hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center. More than 84% of oil output in the Gulf of Mexico has shut and refiners including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Citgo Petroleum Corp. have reduced operations or closed plants in preparation.âThe energy patch is facing a potentially cataclysmic situation in the next 48 hours,â in part as forecasts show âthe storm on a collision course with some of the largest refineries in the world,â Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA, said in a note.The spread between the September and October gasoline contracts rose to as high as 15 cents per gallon during the session, the widest backwardation in a year. The price action âimplies the market is worried about extreme shortage,â Yawger wrote.Some of the largest U.S. refineries are shutting in advance of Laura, affecting nearly 3 million barrels a day of capacity along the U.S. Gulf Coast, according to a Bloomberg calculation. Thatâs about one third of the Gulf Coast refining capacity, according to figures from Lipow Oil Associates.Still, the hurricane will likely only have a short-term impact on prices with this yearâs lackluster summer driving season nearing an end and a pickup in consumption remaining questionable due to the coronavirus pandemic.âEven if the resumption of offshore production were to be slow, increasing the loss of supply, there is a large inventory buffer that precludes a sudden tightening of crude oil availability to refiners when they resume their operations,â said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London.U.S. crude stockpiles are currently at the highest seasonal level in decades, according to Energy Information Administration data.U.S. crude inventories fell by 4.52 million barrels last week and gasoline stockpiles fell by more than 6 million, the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported, according to people familiar. If confirmed by the EIA report on Wednesday, it would be the fifth-straight weekly decline in crude stocks. On the other hand, the API report showed another build in distillate supplies.âThe severe gasoline draw reflects careful inventory management for refiners and distributors to not be stuck with higher quality than they need come the middle of September,â as specifications change for the winter season, said Tom Finlon of GF International. Meanwhile, cash-market gasoline for Colonial Pipeline loading outside Houston rose to the highest in eleven months on Tuesday morning as retailers sought to secure supplies ahead of Laura.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-edges-lower-one-u-002024680.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-25	2020-08-25 12:32:08	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Honeywell International's Debt Overview	Over the past three months, shares of Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) increased by 13.38%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Honeywell International has.Honeywell International's Debt Based on Honeywell International's financial statement as of July 24, 2020, long-term debt is at $17.59 billion and current debt is at $4.50 billion, amounting to $22.09 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $13.78 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $8.31 billion.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Honeywell International has $63.60 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.35. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For August 12, 2020  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For August 11, 2020  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-25	2020-08-25 07:13:10	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	3M or Honeywell: Which Industrial Stock Is The Street Favoring?	Generally, the industrial sector-which includes aerospace, construction, manufacturing and many other businesses, is quite vulnerable to an economic downturn. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted several businesses and led to huge unemployment. Its impact on industrial stocks has been drastic.Both 3M and Honeywell have been in the news for massive production of personal protective equipment, especially N95 masks. But these industrial giants are highly diversified companies and are involved in several other businesses, most of which are struggling due to the slowdown triggered by the pandemic.Using TipRanksâ Stock Comparison tool, we will compare these two industrial giants to see which stock is better positioned to recover faster.3M Company (MMM)The unprecedented surge in the demand for 3Mâs N95 masks was not enough to offset the impact of COVID-19 on the sales from end markets like healthcare elective procedures, automotive OEM (original equipment manufacturers) and aftermarket, general industrial, commercial solutions and office supplies.3Mâs second-quarter sales fell 12.2% to $7.2 billion and adjusted EPS declined 16.4% to $1.78. Sales from the companyâs Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer divisions fell 9.2%, 20.9%, 0.4%, and 6.2%, respectively. The companyâs aggressive cost cuts helped in reducing costs by $400 million in the second quarter.3M was struggling even before the pandemic and was unable to deliver strong numbers for businesses like healthcare and consumer, which are not that cyclical. As part of its restructuring efforts, the company streamlined its business segments to four instead of five, sold certain underperforming businesses like drug delivery, reduced headcount and implemented a new global operating model.Meanwhile, 3M is investing in research and development to capture growth opportunities in air quality, automotive electrification and food safety. (See MMM stock analysis on TipRanks)JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa maintained his Hold rating for 3M following the recent results. A well-executed second quarter against a challenging environment and a âstronger-than-expected bouncebackâ in July made him raise the price target to $159 from $154.RBC Capital analyst Deane Dray was disappointed with the lower-than-anticipated second-quarter earnings and organic sales growth as well as the third-quarter margins outlook. However, he increased his price target to $170 from $158 for 3M stock while maintaining a Hold rating based on a potential positive inflection in July sales given a low-single-digit rise in month-to-date revenue.3M stock has declined 7% so far this year and the average price target of $165.44 indicates a modest 1.2% rise over the next 12 months. One Buy rating, 6 Holds, and 2 Sells add up to a Hold consensus for 3M.Honeywell International (HON)Industrial conglomerate Honeywell provides products and solutions to a wide variety of industries ranging from aerospace, defense, to heaters and Internet of Things solutions.Honeywellâs second-quarter sales fell 19% to $7.5 billion as the pandemic hit its major businesses though areas like defense, warehouse automation and personal protective equipment delivered a strong performance. The quarterâs EPS declined 40% Y/Y to $1.26.The companyâs Aerospace business, which is its largest division by sales, plunged 28% due to lower demand as commercial air travel came to a standstill due to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the strength in the defense and space business saved the segment to some extent.Honeywell Building Technologies sales were down 19%. Performance Materials and Technologies sales also fell 19% hit by the pandemic as well as the softness in the oil and gas sector.Safety and Productivity Solutions sales dropped 1% Y/Y as weakness in sensing and Internet of things, productivity products, and gas sensing, was partially offset by robust demand for personal protective equipment and double-digit growth in Intelligrated. Notably, Intelligrated, which provides warehouse automated solutions, experienced a 300% rise in bookings as e-commerce spiked since the pandemic.Honeywell expects its third-quarter organic sales to be down 15% as Aerospace, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Building Technologies sales are expected to fall by over 25%, 10%, and 10%, respectively.Amid this crisis, the company is looking for prospects in providing customer solutions in areas like e-commerce, health and safety. It is also making cost cuts in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion this year, of which 60% to 70% would be permanent cost reductions.Following the better-than-feared results, JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa maintained his Buy rating for the stock and raised his price target for Honeywell to $185 from $177. The analyst believes that the companyâs âgrowth vectors moving forward are underappreciated,â including the connected portfolio and automation products for warehouses and buildings.However, on August 11, RBC Capital analyst Deane Dray downgraded Honeywell to Hold from Buy and also lowered the price target to $158 from $166. While the analyst recognizes that the company is among the best-in-class multi-industry operators, he is concerned about the weakness in commercial aero and oil and gas markets.Dray summarized, âHoneywell is likely to lag in a cyclical rebound. Patient investors may ultimately be rewarded.â (See HON stock analysis on TipRanks)The Street has a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy rating for Honeywell International with 10 Buys and 5 Hold ratings. Honeywell stock has declined about 10% year-to-date. Analysts expect an upside potential of 3.3% with a 12-month price target of $164.62.ConclusionIt will take quite some time for both 3M and Honeywell to recover to pre-COVID levels as their key businesses are closely aligned to economic recovery. While 3M has a higher dividend yield of 3.6% compared to Honeywellâs 2.3%, Wall Street consensus and long-term prospects appear to make Honeywell a more favorable stock pick right now.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanksâÂ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanksâ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-08-25	2020-08-25 04:17:38	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Apple Stock Split Causes Dow Jones Industrial Average Shuffle; Salesforce, Amgen, Honeywell To Make Entry	The S&P Dow Jones Indices, a division of S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI), on Monday announced certain changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) composition, effective Aug. 31.What Happened: Three new stocks will be added to replace existing stocks in the DJIA index.Cloud computing solutions provider Salesforce.com Inc. (NYSE: CRM) will replace Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM), biotech company Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN) will replace Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), and Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) will replace Raytheon Technologies Corp. (NYSE: RTX).The decision to replace three stocks in the index came after Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) declared a 1:4 stock split, which would also come into effect on Aug. 31.Why It Matters: The iPhone maker is one of the constituents of the DJIA index and the company's stock split decision could bring down the index weightage on the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) IT sector. With the new additions, S&P Dow Jones hopes to offset this reduction and remove company overlap in the index.What's Next: To ensure consistency, new divisors will be used to rebalance the index, specifics of which will be available in the S&P Dow Jones Indices FTP (EDX) site on Aug. 28, according to the statement.Price Action: At the time of the market close on Monday, the DJIA index was up 1.35% at $28,308.46.Among the three new entrants, Salesforce.com shares traded 3% higher at $214.8 in the after-hours session Monday. Amgen shares traded 4% higher at $245, and Honeywell shares were up 3.8% at $165.5.

2020-08-17	2020-08-17 19:16:02	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	U.S. High-Grade Bond Sales Set Record, Reach $1.346 Trillion	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. corporate investment-grade issuance reached a record $1.346 trillion Monday, surpassing 2017âs full-year total in less than eight months amid seemingly endless investor appetite following the Federal Reserveâs unprecedented steps to bolster liquidity.The Fedâs March pledge to use its near limitless balance sheet to buy corporate bonds has lifted nearly every corner of the market, allowing struggling cruise lines, plane makers and hotels to tap much needed financing while providing top-rated companies from Alphabet Inc. to Visa Inc. and Chevron Corp. access to some of the cheapest funding ever seen.Just five months ago, this kind of issuance was virtually unimaginable. The market was frozen as the coronavirus ravaged the U.S. and brought the economy to a standstill. But following the central bankâs intervention, demand quickly returned, and hasnât waned since. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Corporate index reached a record low 1.82% in early August, down from more than 4.5% in March.âCorporate treasurers got the bejesus scared out of them when the funding markets completely shut down in the third and fourth weeks of March,â Gregory Staples, head of fixed income at DWS Investment Management, said earlier Monday. âSo there was the recognition that liquidity is very important and the markets may not be open forever.âA $6.5 billion debt offering from Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and 10 other deals helped secure the issuance record on Monday. The sale in five parts from the owner of the New York Stock Exchange will finance its acquisition of Ellie Mae Inc. Honeywell International Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. were also in the market.As 2020 enters the home stretch, thereâs little sign the borrowing binge is slowing. Investors have poured over $100 billion into funds that buy high-grade bonds over the last 17 weeks, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper.And the cheaper borrowing costs are enticing American companies to return to credit markets two, three, even four times. Many are refinancing debt due in the coming months and years, taking advantage of the opportunity to extend their maturities.More than 30 borrowers priced deals last week, issuing almost $50 billion. DoubleLine Capital said it expects supply to reach $1.9 trillion before the year is out.Still, the barrage of issuance is starting to take its toll on returns, with high-grade bonds in the midst of their worst month since March. They lost 1.58% last week and are down 1.2% so far this month, on track for the first decline since the pandemic took hold and upended markets earlier this year.âWith the debt that these companies have raised, you have to keep in mind that it does add cash to the balance sheet,â Barry McAlinden, senior fixed-income strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said Monday. âTheyâre still very prudent. The narrative isnât that theyâre being reckless at all in adding leverage to the balance sheet during uncertain times.â(Updates total issuance in headline, first paragraph, adds Monday issuance in fifth paragraph and quote at the end)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-high-grade-bond-sales-174906525.html?.tsrc=rss

He thinks strength in 20% of a company can't help to offset the weakness in the other 80% for an extended period of time.Instead of Fastenal, Tepper would buy Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON). It has the best balance sheet in the sector, but it has some issues which provide us with a good entry point. The main issue for Honeywell is its aerospace segment, explained Tepper.Todd Gordon looked at a long-term chart of Fastenal and he sees more upside for the stock. He said it's the best in breed industrial distributor and it has been raising its dividend.

GE stock price target kept at a 9+% discount at CFRA given 'severe' relative weakness in Aviation	CFRA analyst Colin Scarola reiterated his $6 price target for General Electric Co.'s stock , which is 9.4% below current levels, citing his outlook for &quot;poor cost performance&quot; after the industrial conglomerate reported disappointing second-quarter results, which included a &quot;severe decline&quot; in revenue for GE's Aviation business. &quot;The [COVID-19] pandemic's outsized impact on air travel is driving the downturn in Aviation, but we note a materially worse trend than similar businesses,&quot; such as at rival Raytheon Technologies Corp. . GE Aviation revenue fell 44% to $4.38 billion, missing the FactSet consensus of $4.62 billion. Meanwhile, Raytheon reported Tuesday that Collins Aerospace sales fell 35% to $4.30 billion, above expectations of $3.56 billion, according to FactSet. And Honeywell International Inc.  reported on July 24 aerospace sales that dropped 28% to $2.54 billion, but beat the FactSet consensus of $2.41 billion. Scarola said despite his &quot;poor outlook for GE's demand and cost performance,&quot; he was keeping his rating at hold, as the 40% year-to-date decline leaves shares near fair value. Over the same time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has lost 6.9%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ce53923f-ac1d-386b-9500-73cda559e2cd/ge-stock-price-target-kept-at.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-29	2020-07-29 17:14:35	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Boeing and GE Comebacks Get a Covid Setback	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It would be hard for things to get much worse in commercial aerospace, an industry hit particularly hard by the global Covid-19 pandemic. Sober tones and a slew of writedowns out of industry stalwarts Boeing Co. and General Electric Co. provided more evidence ofÂ just how dour the outlookÂ is from here.Second-quarter resultsÂ from the two companies on Wednesday were predictably bleak for a period that includedÂ the worst of the coronavirus slump in air travel andÂ a rush to ground unneeded planes, retire older models and cancel orders for new ones. The best that could be said is that the nearly $8 billion in cash that Boeing and GE burned through collectively in the quarterÂ wasnât quite as terrible as analysts had feared.Â GE at least indicated it expected aÂ  sequential improvement in overall company cash flow in the second halfÂ of the year, with a return to positive numbers by 2021.Given CEO Larry Culpâs tendency to set a low bar, the companyâs usual back-end-weighted seasonality and the likelihood of some moderation in the pressures facing the aviation business as cost cuts take effect and planes come back into service, thereâs at least a possibility that GE could end up with a moderately positive number this yearÂ âÂ although Culp was reluctant to commit to that when pestered repeatedly by analysts on the earnings call. Boeing, too, may find a path to positive cash flow in 2021, Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said on the earnings call, but thereâs little hope of redemption on that front this year. Both companies are bracing for a lower-growth future.Boeing announced fresh cuts to production plans it had already dialed back in April to reflect weaker demand for both its grounded 737 Max and the wide-body 787 and 777 models that are typically used for longer-haul,Â international flights. In an email to employees, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun warned that the company was studying the feasibility of consolidating 787 production in one facility, given the lower rate. A plan to ramp up production of the Max to 31 planes a month by the beginning of 2022 âÂ versus an earlier target of 2021 âÂ may still be too optimistic, writes Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard. While U.S. regulators have signaled they may finally be ready to lift a grounding order by early in the fourth quarter, Boeing still has roughly 450 undelivered Max planes sitting in storage. Delivering those to airlineÂ customers who arenât at all interested in adding to their fleets right now will be a challenge. âI donât know why we wouldâ take delivery of a Max jet this year,Â Gary Kelly, CEO of the planeâs largest operator,Â Southwest Airlines Co., said in an interview with Bloomberg News last week. Calhoun estimates it will take about three years for passenger traffic to recover to 2019 levels.Â TheÂ production cuts, of course, are also bad news for GE, which makes the engines for the Max, the 787 and the yet-to-be-approved 777X.Â âThis will be a multi-year recovery, given the dynamics on the existing fleet and new deliveries going forward,â Culp of GE said in a phone interview. Asked why he hadnât followed Boeing and fellow aerospace suppliers Raytheon Technologies Corp. and Honeywell International Inc. in putting a specific time frame on getting the aerospace market back to last yearâsÂ levels, he said he didnât take issue with forecasts for a recovery byÂ 2023 to 2024, but cautioned that thereâs âa level of false precision in that.â On a call with analysts, he flagged some early signs of improvement â particularly in China, where plane departures were trending down only 9% year over year in late July, compared with earlier slumps of more than 70%. But the coronavirus creates a hosts of unknowns. âAs we work through all of this, weâre mindful that the fall is going to be really important,â CulpÂ said in the interview.Â âWhat happens with cases?Â How do governments respond?Â How does the public respond, let alone the flying public?Â Operationally, we have a conservative posture.âUnlike Boeing âÂ which signaled on Wednesday that it would likely need to cut more than the roughly 16,000 jobs it has already announcedÂ it was eliminating âÂ Culp said it would be premature to look at an expansion of GEâs plans to reduce its aviation divisionâs headcount by 25%.Â A plethora of charges gummed up the numbers at both companies. Ranging from acquisition writedowns to asset impairments, severance expenses and ongoing headaches related to the Max, these charges are a testament to the severe rethink of growth expectations in what had been a high-flying industry. Most notable at Boeing was a $923 million charge in its services arm related to severance expenses and an impaired view of certain assets due to the coronavirus. Calhoun appeared to walk backÂ his predecessorâs goal of building a services business with $50 billion in revenue in an interview with Aviation Week earlier this month. HeÂ cited a need for âtransparency and supportâ for the supply chain and a preference for airlines to buy newer, more efficient jets rather than tap Boeing for services so they can keep flying old ones. The push into lucrative maintenance and spare-parts workÂ by previous CEO Dennis Muilenburg had ruffled the feathers of suppliers who were simultaneously being pushed to drastically cut costs. Taken together, the charge and the comments suggest Boeing is planning for a future where thereâs less of this kind of aircraft spending to go around.Â On a similar note, GE took a $608 million charge in the second quarter related to its aerospace long-term service agreements to reflect updated billing and cost assumptions, including lower expectations for aircraft utilization.Â GE also took a roughly $900 million goodwill writedown related to its 2016 purchases of 3D-printing companies Arcam and Concept Laser as the growth expectations that underwrote those pricey takeovers got pushed out with the slump in aviation.Â Itâs also writing down $839 million of goodwill in its GECAS aircraft lessor arm, with the bulk of that related to the $1.8 billionÂ takeover of helicopter leasing company Milestone Aviation of 2015. Analysts hadÂ warnedÂ that business mightÂ be subject to writedowns since late 2018 when rivalÂ Waypoint Leasing Holdings Ltd. filed for bankruptcy.Â For Boeing and GE âÂ two companies still trying to right themselves fromÂ major setbacks that predate the pandemicÂ âÂ the Covid reckoning has been a bruiser. And the pain will continue for the foreseeable future.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

The caution came after the oilfield giant posted its weakest sales in 14 years. Schlumberger is spending $1 billion to eliminate 21,000 jobs.Meanwhile, Honeywell is targeting cost savings of as much as $1.6 billion in 2020 with actions such as permanently cutting the workforce, reducing work schedules, canceling merit-based increases and slashing executive pay.In Europe, Swiss elevator maker Schindler Holding AG is planning 2,000 job cuts and French aerospace firm Thales SA said about 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) of revenue will disappear this year.Singapore to Finish Testing Most Migrant Workers by August (7:14 a.m. NY)Singapore will complete testing most foreign workers living in dormitories by the beginning of next month, allowing for more businesses to resume activities as their employees are cleared to return.By early August, Singapore will have tested most foreign workers living in dormitories, officials said at a press briefing on Friday, a group previously stated to be 323,000-strong. There are still 28,000 workers serving out their isolation period in various quarantine facilities, they said.Austria Watches Surge of Rhinovirus (6:45 a.m. NY)An Austrian decision to re-tighten mask requirements came as a new surge of rhinovirus cases signaled that people are not following social distancing and hygiene rules as closely, an adviser to Health Minister Rudolf Anschober told journalists.The rhinovirus -- a cause for the common cold with symptoms like runny nose, sneezing and coughing -- is unrelated to the coronavirus, but uses similar channels for infection, and its spread was curbed during the lockdown. In recent weeks, though, itâs risen to even higher numbers than in previous years, a worrying sign for the coronavirus situation, said Professor Elisabeth Puchhammer-Stoeckl of the Medical University of Vienna.Starting today, face masks are mandatory again in Austrian supermarkets, banks and postal offices. Infections have been above 100 per day for much of July, after lingering in the 20s and 30s in June, and the number of active cases stood at 1,461 on Friday, about four times the level on June 14.Russia Cuts Rates (6:30 a.m. NY)The Bank of Russia delivered its third interest-rate cut in a row, but surprised most economists in a Bloomberg survey by opting for a smaller reduction than at recent meetings. The central bank has now slashed interest rates by 325 basis points in the past year, in line with other major emerging markets.Russiaâs economy has been hammered by virus-related lockdowns and falling demand for oil. The economy is heading for its deepest slump in more than a decade, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting a 6.6% contraction. Incomes slumped 8% in the second quarter, the biggest drop since a financial crisis in 1998.The country is one of the most-affected by the virus in the world, with confirmed cases topping 800,000 on Friday.German Study Shows Dogs Can Sniff Out Virus (6:15 a.m. NY)A German foundation has published a study that shows that specially trained dogs can identify patients infected with the coronavirus. The dogs need only a weekâs training and could be deployed to detect infections at places such as airports, border crossings and sporting events, according to the Stiftung Tieraerztliche Hochschule Hannover.Eight dogs from Germanyâs armed forces took part in the study and had a success rate of 94%, the foundation said.Johnson Warns of âTough Timesâ (6:10 a.m. NY)Boris Johnson warned the U.K. will still be dealing with the coronavirus pandemic in mid-2021 and said his government is preparing for a second wave of infections over the winter months.âWe will have tough times ahead in keeping this virus under control, and we have tough times ahead in coming through economically,â the prime minister said Friday in a Sky News interview. âI think that by the middle of next year that we will be well on our way past it.âMinisters outlined plans to widen the normal winter flu vaccination program, doubling those eligible for free injections, as it seeks to minimize pressure on hospitals if coronavirus and flu outbreaks occur at the same time. In televised comments to nurses on Friday, Johnson said he regards those who oppose vaccinations as ânuts.âFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/victoria-reports-six-deaths-u-025647751.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-24	2020-07-24 11:47:43	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Honeywell International's Debt Overview	Over the past three months, shares of Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) rose by 7.87%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Honeywell International has.Honeywell International's Debt Based on Honeywell International's financial statement as of May 1, 2020, long-term debt is at $11.54 billion and current debt is at $4.57 billion, amounting to $16.11 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $7.72 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $8.39 billion.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Honeywell International has $57.42 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.28. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Importance of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Recap: Honeywell International Q2 Earnings  * Earnings Scheduled For July 24, 2020  * A Peek Into Honeywell's Price Over Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-09	2020-07-09 09:00:37	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Policy and Investment Failures Doomed the Biofuel Revolution	(Bloomberg) -- The mood was celebratory on a humid June evening in 2011 as a red-and-white Gulfstream G450 belonging to Honeywell International Inc. took off from a New Jersey airport at sunset on a history-making flight to Paris.I was onboard the executive jet to report on the first transatlantic flight powered by biofuels. One of the Gulfstreamâs engines was burning a blend of petroleum and a sustainable aviation fuel made with oil from the seeds of the inedible weedÂ camelina.Video screens tracked the G4âs route retracing Charles Lindberghâs pioneering 1927 flight across the Atlantic, though our journey was far plusher. At the touch of a button, pleated white shades descended over the aircraftâs large oval windows and fresh air filled the optimally pressurized and quiet wood-trimmed cabin.Technology from Honeywellâs subsidiary UOP hadÂ refined the camelina into renewable jet fuel, and as we reached cruising altitude executives settled into wide leather seats and clinked wine glasses. The trip avoidedÂ emitting 5.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide compared to a conventional flight.âWeâre ready to go to commercial scale and commercial use,â saidÂ Jim Rekoske,Â a Honeywell vice president.Yet nine years later, biofuels account for only a tiny fraction of global jet fuel consumptionâless than 0.1% in 2018 according to the International Energy Agency. In the U.S., the federal Energy Information Administration projects that the consumption of all biofuels will rise from 7.3% of total fuel consumption in 2019 to just 9% in 2040 if oil prices remain low. Even if petroleum prices skyrocket, biofuel consumption is predicted toÂ increase to just 13.5% by 2050.Global investment in biofuel production capacity, meanwhile, plunged from $22.9 billion in 2007 to $500 million in 2019, according to BloombergNEF. That has significant implications for decarbonizing transportation, which is key to keeping global average temperature rise to 1.5C to avoid catastrophic climate impacts.âAlthough biofuels production has grown in recent years, the current growth is clearly insufficient to support the requirements of the energy transition,â the International Renewable Energy Agency concluded in a 2019 report.Biofuelâs dramatic fall stands in stark contrast to other renewable energy technologies. Over the past decade, solar and onshore wind prices dropped 90% and 70% per megawatt-hour, respectively, according to BloombergNEF, and theyâre now the cheapest form of new energy generation for two-thirds of the world. The price of lithium-ion battery packs fell 87%, and BloombergNEFÂ predicts electric cars will become cost competitive with gasoline vehicles by the mid-2020s.But many advanced biofuels startups have either collapsed or now use their technology to make additives for cosmetics, dietary supplements, and food.What went wrong? In short, a mismatch between government policy and the investment and time needed to ramp up complex biofuel supply chains. Venture capitalists accustomed to the relatively quick returns delivered by tech industry startups werenât prepared to finance what could be a decade-long slog to develop new biofuels. Entrepreneurs were overly confident about their technologiesâ potential while government policy did not offer theÂ types of incentives and mandates that allowed the nascent solar and wind industries to take on fossil fuels and become self-sustaining.Above all, biofuelsâ competitiveness was whipsawed by widely fluctuating crude oil prices. Now the industry faces new challenges from the Covid-19 pandemic that has devastated airlines and resulted in a petroleum glut.âLow oil prices makes it very hard for biofuels to compete,â says BloombergNEF analyst Daisy Maugouber. âThatâs why policy has to support advanced biofuels.âBack when the Honeywell Gulfstream touched down at Paris-Le BourgetÂ Airport on a bright June morning in 2011, it seemed that the green jet age had dawned. Investors were still pouring billions of dollars into biofuel startups, and at the Paris Air Show that week, airline executives told me of their plans to transition to liquid renewables to meet expected government mandates and as a hedge against then-soaring oil prices.Over the next several years, I tracked the flight path of advanced biofuels, assuming it would follow the trajectory of solar and wind and upend the old energy order. I was wrongâas were the investors and entrepreneurs who misread the market.Demand remains, though.Â United Airlines Holdings Inc. powers flights operating out of Los Angeles International Airport with biofuels, and JetBlue Airways Corp. announced plans to start using biofuels at San Francisco International Airport this year. Qantas Airways Ltd. had previously pledged to fuel its LAX flights with biofuels beginning in 2020.Â On Wednesday, Amazon.com Inc. announced a 12-month deal to buy sustainable aviation fuel for its Amazon Air fleet.And the need for biofuels hasnâtÂ diminished. Thereâs currently no feasible alternative to decarbonizing two huge and growing sources of COâ emissionsâaviation and shipping. If a Green New Deal is to spark another biofuels boom, then itâs crucial to get it right this time.In July 2012, I boarded another historic flight, this one decidedly less luxe. Strapped backwards into a Navy C-2A Greyhound and wearing an inflatable survival vest and helmet, I was on the first military transport powered by advanced biofuels to land on an aircraft carrier, in this case one refined from algae and used cooking oil.After a short, deafening flight from Honolulu, the twin-prop plane landed on the deck of the USS Nimitz. The nuclear aircraft carrier was steaming off Oahu for a demonstration of the Navyâs Great Green Fleet, the first strike force running on biofuels, though just for two days.Two destroyers, a guided missile cruiser and 71 aircraft were burning biofuels. F/A-18 fighter jets screamed across the sky while E-2C Hawkeyes patrolled the perimeter and Seahawk helicopters ferried Navy brass to the Nimitz.The military is the nationâs largest single consumer of fuel, so the Navyâs purchase of 450,000 gallons of biofuel for the exercise signaled a potentially huge defense market for liquid renewables. Unlike corn ethanol, advanced or so-called second-generation biofuels use nonfood feedstocks like camelina, algae, waste oils, and tallow and donât require modifications of engines or pipeline infrastructure.Utilities under state renewable-energy mandates often sign decades-long agreements to buy electricity from solar and wind developers. The Navy, however, typically issues one-year fuel contracts. That left investors wary of financing biofuel refineries without some guarantee of long-term demand, says Jim Anderson, global project development director for renewables at Honeywell UOP. âThat continues to be a challenge,â he says.The Navy contracts were not only short-lived but alsoÂ sporadic. It would be another three-and-half years before the Navy formally launched the Great Green Fleet on January 20, 2016, with a strike force powered by a one-time purchase of 77 million gallons of biofuel. Exactly a year later, Donald Trump took the oath of office and effectively sunk the Obama administrationâs Great Green Fleet, though some financial support for biofuels continued under previously signed contracts.Mandates like state renewable portfolio standards turbocharged the solar and wind markets by requiring utilities to obtain a growing percentage of electricity from green energy sources. Industry veterans say that instituting similar requirements that government agencies, airlines, and other fossil fuel customers use a certain volume of biofuels could spur long-term investment.Â âI think it certainly helps to drive the demand for biofuels,â says Anderson of sustainable aviation fuel mandates.A month after the 2012 Great Green Fleet demo, I visited the Green Crude Farm, 30 acres of oblong ponds growing algae under the blazing sun in a remote patch of the New Mexico desert. A San Diego startup called Sapphire Energy Inc. built the demonstration project, having secured $104.5 million in federal grants and loan guarantees and raised $244 million in venture funding.With the encouragement of the Navy, Sapphire aimed to produce 1.5 million gallons annually, which it said would be competitive as long as oil prices stayed at around $100 a barrel. Three years later, crude oil prices had dropped below $50 a barrel and Sapphire and other promising startups were faltering. By 2017, Sapphire was out of business.âA number of things happened all at once as these companies began to scale,â says Tim Zenk, a former Sapphire executive. âThey spent their initial capital and didnât have a long enough runway to survive a very difficult energy market in the absence of policy to support biofuel production.ââOne takeaway from biofuel executives is that the sector needs sustained investment from corporations and other institutional investors, the type of commitment Silicon Valley typically cannot provide. âThe venture capital market is not really the right financial vehicle for biofuels,â says Zenk.What can governments do to revitalize the promise of biofuels?The main federal policy to spur production, the 15-year-old Renewable Fuel Standard program (RFS), has proved insufficient to make advanced biofuels competitive. The RFS mandates that gasoline and diesel producers blend a growing volume of second-generation biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Yet annual targets have been slashedÂ because of a lack of supply. The 2020 statutory target of 30 billion gallons had to be revised to 20 billion gallons. In other years, targets for specific classes of advanced biofuels were lowered by as much as 86%. The program expires in 2022.For solar and wind producers, feedstocksâsun and breezeâare free and inexhaustible. Feedstocks for biofuels can constitute 50% or more of production costs. âAny viable feedstock must have the potential to be available cost-effectively in very large quantities,â says Gene Gebolys, chief executive officer of biofuels refiner World Energy Inc.Most advanced biofuels today are made with scavenged feedstocks, such as used cooking oil collected from restaurants. So far, efforts to cultivate nonfood feedstocks at mass scale have failed.In late 2013, I was ushered into an unmarked one-acre greenhouse in a San Diego suburb where a startup called SGB Inc. was raising jatropha. The drought-resistant inedible bush bears walnut-sized seeds rich in oil and can be grown on marginal land.Â By sequencing jatrophaâs genome, SGB scientists created hybrid strains that produced oil in volumes that they said could make an aviation biofuel competitive with petroleum, then selling for around $100 a barrel. When oil prices crashed, so did SGB.Â âWe had the technology, but when energy prices contracted, the mass market lost interest in biofuels,â says Kirk Haney, a venture capitalist and former SGB CEO. âFarmers wonât grow your crop if thereâs no market.âIndustry analysts say that to buffer biofuels from gyrations of the oil market, liquid renewables need the type of government incentives that allowed solar and wind companies to build supply chains, production capacity, and achieve economies of scale. They cite policies such as Californiaâs Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), which requires that petroleum refiners reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels at least 20% by 2030. They do that by purchasing credits generated by biofuel producers.âPolicies like the LCFS in California and the U.S. RFS nationwide provide the basis for monetizing carbon reductions and, in so doing, drive innovation,â says World Energyâs Gebolys, whose company is spending $350 million to expand annual production capacity at its Los Angeles area refinery nearly seven-fold to 306 million gallons.In January, Norway began requiring jet fuel to contain at least 0.5% advanced biofuels, and Sweden is considering a similar mandate. The 191 member states of the International Civil Aviation Organization have agreed that biofuels should replace conventional jet fuel âto a significant percentageâ by 2050.Despite the challenges, the search for breakthrough feedstocks continues. Exxon Mobil Corp. says it has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in advanced algae biofuel technology with the goal of producing 10,000 barrels a day by 2025. And a Los Angeles area startup, Marine BioEnergy Inc., secured a $2.1 million federal grant in 2016 to develop ways to cultivate kelp in offshore farms for harvest as biofuel.âKelp raised in the open ocean doesnât require land, fresh water, pesticides, or artificial nutrients,â says Cindy Wilcox, Marine BioEnergyâs president and co-founder.To test the feasibility of the concept, University of Southern California scientists constructed a âkelp elevator.â During a trial off Catalina Island last year, giant kelp was attached the triangular device and loweredÂ to a depth of 260 feet at night to absorb cold-water nutrients, thenÂ brought backÂ to the surface at dawn.The kelp grew three times faster and weighed four times more on average than kelp growing naturally at a control site, according to Diane Kim, associate director of special projects at USCâs Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies.Wilcox says kelp biofuel could be competitive with oil at $60 a barrel. Whether that projection is realistic depends on overcoming technological, financial, and regulatory hurdles.âAt the end of the day, the cheapest product in a commodity market wins,â says Haney. âI donât see biofuels coming from plants or algae will be a realistic alternative without some form of government policy to drive this.âFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/policy-investment-failures-doomed-biofuel-090037953.html?.tsrc=rss

The Moderate Buy analyst consensus shows 11 Buy ratings versus 4 Hold ratings. Meanwhile, the $153.50 average price target forecasts shares will rise 4.7% in the coming 12 months.

2020-06-15	2020-06-15 17:48:43	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Shortage of Safety Supplies Adds to Risks for U.S. Reopening	(Bloomberg) -- First came the dash to equip U.S. hospitals with protective gear when the coronavirus swept across the country. Now companies are scrambling to get a limited supply of masks, gloves and disinfectants they need to reopen.For businesses already struggling from the pandemic, that means further constraints on time and costs. The shortages also present a conundrum as Americaâs economy restarts: If companies canât get enough supplies, more people are at risk for the virus, adding to the prospect of another surge in cases that would leave the market even more short of protective equipment.âItâs been challenging,â said Peter Elitzer, president of Peter Harris Clothes, a discount retailer that has reopened almost all of its 79 stores. âHow do you find the masks? How do you find the sanitizer? How do you find the wipes? Forget it. To get the Clorox wipes is completely impossible.âElitzer shelled out $60 a gallon for hand sanitizer before tracking down a distiller that could produce it for $35 -- still triple the usual price. Plastic barriers, masks and thermometers are selling at premiums, he said. The company had to furlough workers just to cover the $50,000 in added expenses.Inventories will remain tight and short-term price spikes are expected for high-demand items as businesses crank back up just as doctors begin performing elective surgeries again, said D.G. Macpherson, chief executive officer of W.W. Grainger Inc., the largest U.S. distributor of industrial supplies. Hospitals also are rebuilding stockpiles ahead of a potential second wave of the virus later this year.âThings are still challenged now in a number of categories,â Macpherson said in an interview. âItâs getting better, I would say. But thereâs a long way to go.âAs manufacturers scurry to meet demand, bottlenecks are popping up. Honeywell International Inc. crammed a typical nine-month procedure into six weeks to open production sites for N95 masks in Rhode Island and Arizona. The company wants to add more capacity but is bumping up against a lack of the filter material thatâs sandwiched between the inner and outer layers.Thereâs no easy fix because there are only two manufacturers of the machines that produce the material, said Will Lange, chief of Honeywellâs personal protective equipment business.Disposable gloves and hospital gowns are among the items with the biggest kinks in the supply chain, he said. Honeywell is looking to set up U.S. output of hospital gowns after beginning a production line in North Africa. The company doesnât make gloves but procures them from third-party manufacturers and sells them, a task thatâs become difficult after the World Health Organization put in an order for âmultiple millionsâ of them, Lange said.The tight market for those products could become critical if Covid-19 resurges. As it is, cases are accelerating in some states, with Texas and Florida reporting record numbers of new infections. This has led to concerns that reopenings may come at the cost of spreading the virus.âI donât think the supply chain is ready yet for a second wave of massive demand for PPE,â Lange said. âItâs probably going to take about nine months to get to a really good spot.âMaryam Barnes, an orthodontist in the Dallas suburb of Allen, Texas, said she is paying exorbitant prices for masks, gowns, face shields and other supplies just as the number of patients sheâs able to schedule has dropped by half because of social distancing.âDisposable gowns -- those are ridiculous,â Barnes said. They can cost as much as $20 each, whereas it used to be $20 to $30 for boxes of 50, she said.âStrangeâ ActivityThe top concerns among small-business owners are whether customers will return as they reopen and if there will be adequate supplies of hand sanitizer, disinfectants and face coverings, according to a survey in May by the National Federation of Independent Business.The trade group, which represents about 300,000 small businesses, had urged members to begin accumulating those supplies about a month ago in anticipation of the reopening, said Holly Wade, director of research and policy analysis. Thereâs concern that larger companies with more buying power will have an edge in acquiring essential goods, squeezing small businesses even more on availability.âThereâs so much strange business activity thatâs happening right now,â Wade said. âEven if they have a supply now, itâs unclear how long those will last and if theyâll be able to restock.âH Town Restaurant Group, which has four locations in the Houston area, stocked up on about six weeks of supplies including masks, gloves and sanitizer and is purchasing more in case a second wave of the virus puts more pressure on the supply chain, said co-owner Tracy Vaught. The group is operating at a loss as it opens its restaurants at limited capacity, and the extra cost of protective gear for her 150 employees doesnât help.âItâs just what we have to do to be in business,â Vaught said. âItâs not negotiable.âIn Albany, New York, Elitzer of Peter Harris Clothes worked from his dining-room table during the lockdown to secure supplies. Locally made face coverings cost $8 apiece before he received a shipment from China at $1.45 each. He negotiated acrylic barriers down to $75 each from a local sign manufacturer, after initially paying as much as $175.Other entrepreneurs are also proving resourceful in finding their own solutions. Steve Trollope, who co-owns a prenatal-imaging center in Reno, Nevada, resorted to making his own hand sanitizer from aloe and Everclear grain alcohol to provide for workers and the patients he attended throughout the pandemic.âEarly on, it was a real scramble. We were at the point of getting desperate to locate certain items,â said Trollope, who now can buy sanitizer again. âThe supply chain seems to be mending itself.âGrainger expects demand for plastic barriers, masks, disinfectants and other supplies related to Covid-19 to be elevated for the long term. Companies are adopting practices that wonât fade even if the virus eventually does, said Macpherson, the CEO.âFor the next few years, weâre going to be in a world where these types of products are going to be the norm for how we work,â he said. âFrankly, when we go into the grocery store, you ask yourself, âWhy didnât we always have this? Why did we let people sneeze on each other in the first place?ââ(Updates with wave of new cases in 11th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shortage-safety-supplies-adds-risks-174843261.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-09	2020-06-09 01:51:29	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Can the U.S. EndÂ Chinaâs Control of the Global Supply Chain?	(Bloomberg) -- The trade war amplified calls in the U.S. and elsewhere for reducing dependence on China for strategic goods. Now, the pandemic has politicians vowing to take action.The Trump administration has talked about bringing supply chains home from China, and even publicly floated the need for a group of friendly nations in Asia that could help produce essential goods. President Donald Trump last month even said the U.S. would âsave $500 billionâ if it cut off ties with China.But interviews with nearly a dozen government officials and analysts in the Asia-Pacific region show that any broader effort to restructure supply chains is little more than wishful thinking so far. While governments are pushing to win investments, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.âs planned state-of-the-art semiconductor factory in the U.S., it wonât be simple to dismantle an entrenched system when many companies are struggling to survive.More likely is that the virus will accelerate a change that was already driven by market forces as rising wages and costs in China over the past decade caused an exodus of lower-value manufacturing, much of it to Southeast Asia. Thatâs despite the desire from some in the Trump administration to start decoupling the worldâs biggest economies as the U.S. and China spar over everything from the virus to 5G networks to Hong Kong.âThe rhetoric meets the reality, which is that many firms have supply chains set up the way they do for very sensible reasons,â said Deborah Elms of the Asian Trade Centre, which has seen an increase of companies looking for advice on reorganizing to increase competitiveness. âComing out of Covid, itâs going to be even harder to move supply chains because your cash flow is low, your staff are working from home or coming slowly back into the office, and the business climate has shifted.âWhile the world trade network mostly held up well amid rolling lockdowns as Covid-19 spread, the economic cost fueled calls among politicians for greater self-sufficiency and alternatives to China. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whose department announced an Economic Security Strategy last year, in April named Australia, New Zealand, Japan, India, and South Korea as countries that the U.S. has been talking to on supply chains.A key plank of the State Departmentâs new Economic Security Strategy is expanding and diversifying supply chains that protect âpeople in the free world,â according to Keith Krach, a State Department official who leads efforts to develop international policies related to economic growth.Krach said in April a so-called âEconomic Prosperity Networkâ of like-minded allies would be built for critical products.âChina Plus OneâIndustries would include pharmaceuticals, medical devices, semiconductors, automotive, aerospace, textiles and chemicals, among others.But the idea right now appears to lack any firm foundation. The State Department doesnât have jurisdiction over trade, and officials in other Asian countries said no formal talks were taking place. A person close to the administration said Krach is prone to pushing grand ideas publicly that havenât yet become policy.Still, other governments are moving on their own to shift production away from China -- especially since the Covid disruptions. This includes Taiwan and Japan, which were among the biggest investors in Chinaâs manufacturing capacity in the early days.âMany companies have already begun adopting a âChina plus oneâ manufacturing hub strategy since the U.S.-China trade war began in 2018, with Vietnam having been a clear beneficiary,â said Anwita Basu, head of Asia country risk research at Fitch Solutions. While the pandemic will give that another push, âshifts away from China will be slow as that country still boasts an annual manufacturing output that is so large that even a group of countries would struggle to absorb a fraction of it.âIn 2019, Taiwanese officials encouraged the islandâs firms to build a ânon-red supply chainâ outside of China, passing a law that promised rent assistance, cheap finance, tax breaks and simplified administration for investments in Taiwan. The move helped the islandâs economy weather the trade war last year and led to more than NT$1 trillion ($33.5 billion) pledged or invested domestically, and more overseas.Japan recently started down the same path, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâs government budgeting about 220 billion yen ($2 billion) for companies shifting production back home and 23.5 billion yen for those seeking to move production to other countries.âEveryone agrees we really have to reconsider the sustainability of supply chains,â Hiroaki Nakanishi, chairman of Hitachi Ltd. and head of Japanâs biggest business lobby Keidanren, said on television last month. âItâs unrealistic to suddenly return all production to Japan. But if we are totally reliant on one specific country and they have a lockdown, there will be huge consequences.âSouth Korea has similar plans as part of its economic blueprint for the rest of the year, announced earlier this month. The government said it will provide tax incentives, ease investment-related regulations and expand financial support for companies that âu-turn.â Yet, it hasnât said how much money will be earmarked for the entire support program.For all that, China retains some key advantages. Last year 38% of Taiwanâs $11 billion of overseas investment still went to the mainland, as did 10% of Japanâs -- despite increased investments in Southeast Asia over the past few decades due to periodic bouts of anti-Japanese rioting in China.Young Liu, chairman of Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry, whose Foxconn unit manufactures iPhone in plants in China, said in mid-May that itâs difficult to move assembly of mobile devices to the U.S due to the sheer number of workers needed.âChina remains unmatched as a manufacturing site given its numbers of skilled workers, deep supplier networks and the governmentâs credible public support for manufacturers and provision of reliable infrastructure,â wrote Gavekal Dragonomics analyst Dan Wang in a report in April.Even if companies find economic alternatives to Chinese factories, or bow to political pressure to increase production in their home markets, thereâs another reason why production inside China continues to make sense: the vast and growing Chinese domestic market.Tesla, HoneywellTesla Inc. is now producing cars there for what is now the worldâs largest auto market, and last month Chinese Premier Li Keqiang sent Honeywell International Inc. a letter welcoming its new investment in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus outbreak started. He and other Chinese officials have touted continued economic cooperation with the U.S. and vowed to implement a âphase oneâ trade deal with the U.S. reached in January.âThe formation and development of global industrial and supply chains are determined by market forces and companiesâ choices,â Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in March. âAs such, it is unrealistic and insensible to try to sever them or even trumpet âshiftingâ or âdecouplingâ theories as they run counter to economic law.âFor all the talk of dependence on China, the pandemic showed that other nations could quickly adapt to meet the need for critical supplies when Chinaâs lockdown halted deliveries of protective clothing, ventilators and medical supplies. Vietnam rapidly ramped up production of face masks, exporting more than 415 million in four months, while the U.S. pushed automakers and other manufacturers to retool plants to make respirators and other critical supplies.Over the long term, however, there are questions of whether those models are sustainable -- and who will pay for new plants outside China.Waving a WandA May 14 executive order from Trump allows the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., Americaâs development bank for emerging markets, to partner with the Department of Defense in the U.S. to lend money to American companies looking to build out supply chains for critical goods such as ventilators and generic drugs.But with governments already having to fund trillions of dollars in bailout packages for existing businesses and companies going bust in droves, finding the extra capital to restructure global supply chains is a tall order. Andrew Hastie, an Australian lawmaker and chair of the nationâs security and intelligence committee, called in a recent essay for âtime limited tax incentivesâ to build national self-reliance in key pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other critical goods.In the end, the biggest force diluting Chinaâs position in the global supply chain will likely be the long, slow evolution of global trade, as companies see opportunities that arise from new markets, new technologies and changing patterns of wealth. Why would a firm âsay to their staff and their shareholders we have opted for political reasons to change the way that we do things,â said Elms, whose organization helps governments formulate trade policy.âThe numbers have to make sense,â she said. âThe structure that you have is based on millions of individual company decisions. Itâs not so easy to wave a wand and say: Make it so!â(Updates with South Korean policy to get companies to invest at home in 16th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-end-china-control-global-210000930.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-21	2020-05-21 16:41:51	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Ford Is the Poster Child for America's Grand Reopening	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- After a prolonged shutdown, Ford Motor Co. officially resumed production at its North American factories this week. It hasnât been as smooth a process as the company might have hoped: Ford had to temporarily close two critical facilitiesÂ this week to allow for a deep cleaning after workers tested positive for the coronavirus. An Explorer SUV plant in Chicago was closed a second time after an employee at a nearby supplier facility tested positive for the virus, causing a parts shortage.This is the reality of manufacturing for the time being as companies fret about worker safety and the legal and reputational risks of not doingÂ enough to protect employees. Unlike Ford, whose products fall into a category of consumer spending thatâs become even more discretionary amid the pandemic,Â wide swaths of the industrial sector were deemed essential and allowed to remain operational. Those companies, too, have had their share of growing pains as they adjust to a new way of working.Boeing Co. temporarily closed its factories in the Puget Sound area in March after a worker died of the coronavirus and later briefly shuttered work at its 787 plant in South Carolina. CBS Minnesota reported earlier this month that a Honeywell International Inc. facility in Minneapolis had closed after a worker tested positive. Whirlpool Corp. closed its Amana, Iowa, refrigerator plant at least twice after employees tested positive for the virus, according toÂ the Gazette local paper. Deere & Co. and Altria Group Inc.âs Philip Morris USA are among the many others that have had to close plants on a limited basisÂ to avoid outbreaks among workers.Â Lockheed Martin Corp., meanwhile, said this week it will temporarily slow production of the F-35 fighter jet because of delays at suppliers.Â Â Itâs a lot harder, though, to bring factories back to life than it is to just figure it out as you go along. Ford may be a manufacturer, but because itâs one of the few to have experienced an extended lockdown, itâsÂ arguably aÂ better benchmark for the non-industrial economy. You better believe that office-based companies that have sent most of their workers home are keeping a close eye on how the likes of Ford fare in flipping the switch back on. SeeingÂ the automakerâs setbacks this week, companies that can operate without their employees clustered in the same place may be less keen to rushÂ back.Â Theyâre getting a more continuous stream of work out of their employees now than they would if they had to hit the pause button and clear out the office every few weeks. And the mixed messages from the White House aren't helpful: President Donald Trump is due to visit a Ford factory in Michigan thatâs been converted to ventilator production and has been wishy-washy on whether he will adhere to the companyâs face-mask requirements.Â Already, American Express Co. CEO Steve Squeri andÂ Visa Inc.Â CEO Al Kelly said this week that most of theirÂ employees would work from home for the rest of the year. Some 28% of employers recently surveyed by Challenger, Gray & Christmas said they would make work-from-home arrangements permanent for at least some employees. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and social media site Twitter Inc. are among those who have publicly said remote working will be their indefinite default option.Â Facebook Inc. said Thursday it would follow suit and move to a more permanent remote workforce.At the end of the day, manufacturing or non-manufacturing, it's all interconnected.Â How permanent this shift to work from home will beÂ is debatable, but if companies end up needing less office space, by default that means fewerÂ HVAC systems, commercial lighting, fire and security products or even 3M Co.âs Post-it notes. And if workers arenât going to be commuting, do they still need to buy cars from Ford? There's a lot riding on getting reopening right.Â Â  Â Â This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-05-20	2020-05-20 15:00:59	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Safe-Flying Vision: Virus-Killing Robots, Fever Checks by Camera	(Bloomberg) -- Honeywell International Inc. has been thinking about what it will take to coax people back onto airplanes. A virus-killing robot that can patrol empty aisles between flights, zapping out ultra-violet light, makes a good start.The company has more in mind: temperature-taking cameras that can also flag airport officials when people arenât wearing a face mask properly, a system that spots overcrowded areas, and air-quality sensors that constantly monitor for pathogens.âWe think these systems will be absolutely sufficient to get people back on planes,â said Mike Madsen, chief of Honeywellâs aerospace unit, which provides a wide range of aircraft parts and services to the industry. âItâs not enough to feel safe just on the airplane, theyâve got to feel safe and be safe all the way from door to door.âMaking people secure when flying again isnât just important to airlinesâ survival. Honeywell needs the industry back on its feet so that its own aerospace business can recover from a slump thatâs expected to reduce revenue in its largest unit by 25% this quarter.Honeywell is uniquely poised to meet the challenge. The company can tap into technology itâs developed for other parts of its business, including warehouse automation, building security and gas detection equipment. It also makes protective gear. After boosting production of N95 masks to help supply medical workers during the pandemic, it can offer those masks to airlines, too.Airport Walk-ThroughHoneywell is talking with airports and about 100 airlines about implementing the safety equipment, Madsen said in an interview this week. A lot of the systems, such as the infrared cameras and air-quality sensors, are available now. Others, such as the beverage-cart-sized, UV-light robot, are a few months away.Madsen has a vision of how all these systems can work together to make travelers safer. Hereâs how he described what it could soon feel like to walk through an airport and board a plane in a world plagued by Covid-19:Upon entering the airport, an infrared camera automatically takes your temperature and confirms that you are wearing a mask. The checks continue periodically as you head for your gate, and a system also alerts authorities if people are crowded too closely together.Before you get on the plane, two robots ply the aisle, blanketing the interior with ultraviolet light with the power to kill pathogens like the coronavirus. Sensors tucked into nooks and crannies show if the machines miss a spot. As a double precaution, a disinfectant fogger flows from the air vents of the empty plane to sanitize the air, surfaces and the air-supply system itself.Employees that tidy up enter the plane after the robotic deep cleaning, keeping them safe. The cleaning procedure takes only about 10 minutes, so your boarding time is still on schedule. Before getting on the plane, youâre handed a kit with a mask, wipes, hand sanitizer and non-latex gloves.During the flight, the cabin air is monitored with hockey puck-sized, wireless sensors to ensure itâs safe. The monitoring also helps airlines pump in engine-warmed fresh air in just the right amount to avoid dragging needlessly on power and burning extra fuel.After leaving the plane at your destination, you donât notice that youâre again scanned for temperature and compliance for protective gear as you traverse the airport. You also may not see the wireless sensors distributed throughout the airport to check that air is circulating properly. The information you and other passengers provided to the airlines or airport security is added to a database thatâs available in case contact tracing is required.Many of these solutions didnât exist three months ago before the virus began spreading throughout the world, Madsen said. As lockdown restrictions ease and business reopen, people will need to travel.

2020-05-07	2020-05-07 18:44:52	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	3 Stocks Flashing Signs of Strong Insider Buying	Are we moving towards a full market recovery? The waters are still murky, and thus, the trajectory of stocks remains somewhat unclear. Therefore, the pros on Wall Street suggest selecting an investing strategy that regardless of the broader marketâs movements, will yield returns. One such approach involves following those on the inside.These insiders are a companyâs board members and corporate officers who are held accountable to shareholders. Given the nature of their roles within a company, they know the ins and outs of the business, and have access to information that could spur share price movements before the general public. To make it fair for everyday investors, corporate insiders have to disclose any purchases or sales. There could be several reasons to sell shares, but thereâs usually only one reason insiders buy, so a purchase could be a signal to investors that gains are on the horizon.Bearing this in mind, we used the Insidersâ Hot Stocks tool from TipRanks to pinpoint three stocks insiders have been snapping up recently. The platform also revealed that each ticker has received Buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Letâs jump right in.Boyd Gaming (BYD)Owning and operating 29 gaming properties in ten states, Boyd Gaming is one of the largest casino entertainment companies in the U.S. While the bears might point out that 2020 hasnât been kind to this name, the insider sentiment is swinging strongly positive.On the first of this month, executive chairman William S. Boyd, pulled the trigger on 100,000 shares. As for the value of the purchase, it came in at $1,607,000.BYD has scored fans within the analyst community as well. Writing for Deutsche Bank, analyst Luis Chinchilla tells clients âthe current environment has provided investors the opportunity to own Boyd Gaming, a high-quality credit in our view, at attractive pricing based on our expectations.â He added, âFrom a fundamental perspective, we like this credit owing to (1) the company's ownership of an attractive portfolio of properties in the regional markets; and (2) sufficient liquidity to navigate the challenging environment.âIn a recent call with investors, management stated that all of its properties are currently closed and after factoring in CAPEX, interest expenses, rent and OPEX, the company is burning through about $60 million per month. Having said that, its liquidity of $741 million, not including the $90 million worth of cage cash, should be enough to support its operations for the next twelve months, in Chinchillaâs opinion.Looking forward, Chinchilla said, âWith regard to our expectations, we currently forecast total leverage to peak at ~13.7x in 2020. We anticipate that the company will pay down the revolver before year-end 2020. For 2021, we expect total leverage to decrease to ~6.3x.âIt should be unsurprising, then, that Chinchilla upgraded his rating to a Buy. Not to mention the $22 price target puts the upside potential at 28%.What does the rest of the Street have to say? As it turns out, other analysts are generally on the same page. 9 Buys and 2 Holds add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. Given the $24.60 average price target, shares could rise 48% in the next year. (See Boyd Gaming stock analysis on TipRanks)Honeywell International (HON)Leading the way for more than 100 years, Honeywell is one of the premier industrial companies, with it boasting four operational segments including aerospace, home and building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions. Despite its recent rough going, HON insiders are betting on a turnaround.On April 24, not one, not two, but ten different company Directors made informative buys in the amount of $57,615. Following the purchases, the Directors saw their holdings increase by 429 shares.Credit Suisse analyst John Walsh appears to echo the Directorsâ sentiment. He acknowledges that it could take a few years to see a muted recovery in the aerospace market, but that doesnât mean investors should write HON off.â...we see value in HON based on their history of operational execution and strong liquidity position. In our opinion, HON should be among the first industrial cos to restart share repo or deploy capital for M&A. HON also offers a way to participate in unexpected Aerospace upside, as their portfolio will face less parked aircraft risk without commercial engines,â Walsh explained.Additionally, HON is preparing for the worst. To this end, management stated that itâs planning to reduce fixed costs by $1.1-$1.3 billion in 2020 by trimming discretionary spending, limiting hiring and reducing incentive payouts. It should be noted that 30-40% of these cuts will only be short-term.Walsh added, âCompared to 2008 crisis, we think HON is better prepared to weather the downturn this time. HONâs balance sheet is less levered at 0.8x (net debt) versus 1.2X in Q4 2008. Honeywellâs pension asset allocation has resulted in overfunding despite recent market volatility. HON also refinanced â¬1 billion of debt and raised additional $6 billion through 2-year DD-TL. This leaves the company with over $20 billion of liquidity.âSure, some investors have expressed concern regarding the rate in which demand is recovering in China and sales declines in the next quarter, but Walsh argues that this should be partially offset by HONâs defense segment.Taking all of this into consideration, Walsh stayed with the bulls. Along with his Outperform call, he bumped up the price target from $148 to $158, indicating 18% upside potential. (To watch Walshâs track record, click here)As for the rest of the Street, the bulls have it. HONâs Moderate Buy consensus rating breaks down into 9 Buys and 4 Holds received in the last three months. The $149.08 average price target suggests shares could surge 11.5% in the next year. (See Honeywell stock analysis on TipRanks)Unity Bancorp, Inc. (UNTY)Through its community-oriented commercial bank, Unity Bank, holding company Unity Bancorp is able to provide a diverse range of accounts as well as a complete portfolio of business products and online services. Shares have already gained 43% in the last month, but judging by the insider activity, even more growth could be in store.Digging deeper into the insider activity, a total of three informative buys were made since April 22. The first of these purchases was made by Director Mark Brody, who spent $3,463 to acquire 295 shares. Making our way to the larger purchases, Robert Dallas and David Dallas, Directors and over 10% owners of UNTY, snapped up 20,000 shares, spending $305,550 in the process.On the analyst front, Boenning & Scattergoodâs Erik Zwick has also been singing UNTYâs praises. Part of the excitement surrounding this name is related to its most recent quarterly results. For the first quarter of 2020, EPS landed at $0.50, versus $0.52 in the prior-year quarter. While this figure fell slightly short of the consensus estimate, it exceeded Zwickâs $0.46 call.In addition, its NIM expanded by 4 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 3.92% as the companyâs liability sensitive balance sheet is ideally positioned to absorb recent Fed Funds rate cuts, according to Zwick. Core fee revenue also flew past the analystâs estimate thanks to gains on the sale of mortgage loans.It should be noted that non-accrual loans and net charge-offs could rise during the second half of the year with the fading of deferral periods and government stimulus impacts. However, Zwick thinks that âUnity is a conservative underwriter and is closely working with its borrowers, which should help limit the magnitude of losses.âThe analyst added, âThe company operates a traditional, commercial-focused community bank model that we believe should be attractive to risk averse investors who prefer steady growth and a focus on efficiency. Combined with an attractive footprint, above-peer profitability, strong capital and reserves and the ability to grow tangible book value 11%-plus annually, we believe the risk/reward profile is favorable today with shares trading at a discount to peers on a P/TBV basis (0.84x vs. 0.90x).âTo this end, Zwick maintained his Outperform rating and $21 price target. Should this target be met, a twelve-month gain of 45% could be in the cards. (To watch Zwickâs track record, click here)Looking at the consensus breakdown, it has been relatively quiet when it comes to other analyst activity. Only one other analyst has published a review recently, but it was also bullish, making the consensus rating a Moderate Buy. At $19, the average price target implies 41% upside potential.

2020-05-05	2020-05-05 23:12:39	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Trump Says U.S. Must Reopen Even If More Americans Get Sick, Die	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump launched headlong into his push to reopen the country on Tuesday, saying Americans should begin returning to their everyday lives even if it leads to more sickness and death from the pandemic.Trump, speaking in Phoenix during his first trip outside Washington in more than a month, said heâs preparing for âphase twoâ of the U.S. response to the coronavirus. That will include disbanding the White House task force of public health experts, including Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, that have steered the government response to the outbreak so far.Trump acknowledged that reopening the economy would likely lead to more suffering.âWill some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes,â Trump said. âBut we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.âOn his visit to a Phoenix-based Honeywell International Inc. factory producing medical masks, Trump made his most forceful case yet that the economic damage to the country has become too great to sustain an extended shutdown. He encouraged Americans to think of themselves as âwarriorsâ as they consider leaving their homes, a tacit acknowledgment of deep public reservations about re-opening the country too soon.The president has expressed increasing frustration with the coronavirus-sparked recession that has put more than 30 million Americans out of work and hurt his case for a second term. The U.S. continues to have the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world, with about 1.2 million people infected and more than 70,000 killed so far.Speaking separately in an ABC News interview that aired Tuesday evening, Trump said closing down the nation was âthe biggest decision Iâve ever had to make.âAnd he was resolute about the decision to reopen the nation, despite the certainty of suffering it will cause until a vaccine is developed.âThereâll be more death,â he said. âThe virus will pass, with or without a vaccine. And I think weâre doing very well on the vaccines but, with or without a vaccine, itâs going to pass, and weâre going to be back to normal.ââBut itâs been a rough process. There is no question about it,â Trump said. âI think our economy is going to be ragingâ next year, he added.No Face MaskWhile in Phoenix, Trump encouraged states to ease social-distancing measures and allow businesses to reopen, though he cautioned that it should be done âsafely.âYet, the president declined to set an example for the nation by engaging in one government-recommended safety protocol himself: wearing a face mask. As he toured the Honeywell plant, Trump wore only safety goggles. Music from his standard campaign rally soundtrack played over loudspeakers, including Lee Greenwoodâs âGod Bless the USAâ and Guns Nâ Rosesâs âLive and Let Die.âSenior White House officials also did not don the masks, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend when social distancing isnât possible. Factory workers, members of the press and other support staff did. Trump also lamented that he had to stand six feet apart from two supporters during his speech, including one who was wearing a sequined denim vest with his campaign slogan.Trump said that âdoctorsâ he didnât name had advised him to close the economy âfor a couple of years.ââI created, with a lot of other very talented people and the people of our country, the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest that weâve ever had,â Trump said. âAnd then one day they said, âwe have to close our country.â Well, now itâs time to open up.âPublic-health experts have repeatedly warned the country risks a second wave of infections if restrictions are lifted too early, which could lead to another round of shutdowns and economic damage.Models âSo WrongâBut even as Trump said a full-scale re-opening could lead to more deaths, he expressed optimism the virus would go away. And he added that if cases do rebound, it would be like a âfireâ that could be extinguished âfast.âHe also dismissed two new projections that painted a gruesome picture of what could happen if the country lifts shutdown orders too quickly: a Johns Hopkins University model showing deaths could reach 3,000 per day by June 1 and a University of Washington analysis showing the U.S. death toll could reach 135,000 by the beginning of August.âThese models have been so wrong from day one. Both on the low side and the upside. Theyâve been so wrong, theyâve been so out of whack. And they keep making new models, new models and theyâre wrong,â the president said.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said earlier Tuesday the Johns Hopkins model, included in a government document obtained Monday by the New York Times, relied on âfaulty assumptionsâ about mitigation efforts and didnât represent federal government projections.âThe people of our country are warriors,â Trump said of Americans, some 69% of whom are âsomewhatâ or âveryâ worried about contracting Covid-19, according to an analysis of polls by fivethirtyeight.com.Vice President Mike Pence said earlier Tuesday the White House has begun discussing disbanding the coronavirus task force that has advised Trump on the federal response to the outbreak, a move that could happen as soon as later this month.âMike Pence and the task force have done a great job, but weâre now looking at a little bit of a different form and that form is safety and opening. And weâll have a different group, probably, set up for that,â Trump said in Phoenix.When asked if the move meant he considers the mission of combating the virus to be accomplished, Trump replied: âNo.âFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-says-u-must-reopen-213146395.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-01	2020-05-01 21:31:27	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	10 Stocks to Buy as They Ride a Coronavirus Tailwind	"[Editor's note: ""10 Stocks to Buy as They Ride a Coronavirus Tailwind"" is regularly updated to include the most relevant information available.]After suffering one of the worst declines in history, the investment markets mounted a comeback in the second half of March. Even this small piece of optimism appears to be failing, though, due to enormous fundamental pressures. Nevertheless, not everything is melting down. Certain industries may offer what I'll call, for lack of a better phrase, coronavirus stocks to buy.For this list of publicly traded companies, I'm focusing on names that are mostly relevant to the present crisis. While virtually all sectors have printed red ink, a few individual companies either have performed surprisingly well amid the chaos or have pertinent businesses that are on discount. Additionally, many of these coronavirus stocks to buy offer upside potential once we get through this awful season.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOver the last few weeks, we've seen radical changes in our society. Just a month ago, we never heard phrases like ""social distancing"" or ""flattening the infection curve."" Now, they've become part of our everyday lexicon.As well, certain household products which we've never given a second thought to are now considered the modern-day gold coin. Of course, some analysts may assume that once the pandemic dies down, demand for coronavirus stocks may die with it. However, that might not be the case.  * 10 Stocks to Invest In for a Post-Coronavirus Whipsaw Consider that the Great Depression forever changed American life and the generations affected by it. For better or for worse, the hoarding of essentials may become permanently etched into our memory. Though many states are reopening from mandatory shutdowns, this painful period of sacrifice will not be forgotten.Here are the ten coronavirus stocks to buy for our new normal. Coronavirus Stocks to Buy: Teladoc Health (TDOC)Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Back in the good ole days when my biggest concern was the outrage I felt that the Houston Astros - remember those guys? - could keep their ill-gotten World Series title, I liked Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC). However, I didn't quite like the price tag on TDOC stock. Well, with the smelly stuff hitting the proverbial fan, Teladoc is one of the few coronavirus stocks that will enjoy perhaps universal bullish consensus.You want to talk about social distancing? With Teladoc's smartphone app, you can have all the social distancing you want. Obviously, this is a net positive for the patient. However, in the age of the disease known as Covid-19, the safety of medical professionals is also paramount.According to the Wall Street Journal, during the peak of the crisis, our healthcare infrastructures suffered myriad problems, including recently financial pressures. Thus, it is absolutely vital that doctors and medical professionals be protected during this crisis. And Teladoc will help not only in this outbreak but also for other contagious diseases in the future. Under our new paradigm, TDOC stock is an easy buy among coronavirus stocks. Gilead Sciences (GILD)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Obviously, pharmaceutical firms have experienced a surge in momentum as they race to find a Covid-19 treatment. Out of these industry-specific coronavirus stocks to buy, I'm looking carefully at Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD). Like other competitors in the field, Gilead got to work immediately on a vaccine. But with regulatory approval a long time away, health experts are looking at currently available treatments. This obviously helps the case for GILD stock.  * 7 Stocks Insiders Are Buying Big Amid the Market Panic According to NPR, Gilead's antiviral, intravenous medicine remdesivir has garnered significant interest. Given its potential to address Covid-19, the drug underwent and is still undergoing multiple clinical trials across the globe. Recently, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci expressed his support for remdesivir due to encouraging results in reducing Covid-19 recovery time.Interestingly, the Food and Drug Administration never approved remdesivir, nor did any other country's regulatory agency. Basically, GILD stock may have new life thanks to a retreaded product. Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO)Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com A smaller-capitalized competitor to Gilead, Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:INO) has nevertheless made one of the biggest splashes among coronavirus stocks to buy. Long mired in mediocrity in terms of market performance, INO stock exploded higher when Inovio announced a possible vaccine. From just the genetic profile of the coronavirus, the company utilized their proprietary technology to produce this potential solution.In a way, INO stock has a near-term and long-term narrative. Logically, with several pharmaceutical companies racing for a viable treatment, Inovio should attract interest. Yes, there's much competition. However, this is a dynamic situation.More importantly, Inovio's capability of fast-tracking a vaccine without physically receiving a sample of the virus is impressive. Right now, INO stock is taking a hit so you wouldn't necessarily want to dive into this speculative name. Still, when shares calm down, you may want to consider it with money you can afford to lose.True, Gilead's remdesivir has sucked the momentum out of INO. But because the world is now focused on infectious disease mitigation, Inovio has received a booster shot of relevance. Clorox (CLX)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com Synonymous with cleaning products, most people know about Clorox (NYSE:CLX) perhaps by muscle memory or instinct. One thing is for sure though: prior to the pandemic, I've never fielded a question from someone interested in buying CLX stock. Well, this is one more item to include in our new normal. Among coronavirus stocks to buy, Clorox is easily the sexiest.Once panic hit our communities, this brand flew off the shelves. Now, it's gotten to a point where if someone had a choice between a ""Bennie"" and a Clorox hand sanitizer, they'll probably pick the latter. That's one way to justify buying CLX stock.  * 10 Stocks to Invest In for a Post-Coronavirus Whipsaw Another? I think this outbreak may forever change our consumer psyche. Even after the coronavirus fades away, we will likely stock up for the next big virus, just in case. This gives CLX stock a longer upside pathway. Honeywell (HON)Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Due to the incredible volatility that we've seen, Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is by no means a sure thing. Currently, shares have turned negative once again as economic vulnerabilities have recently come to the forefront. Still, HON is one of the most relevant coronavirus stocks to buy.As you know, N95 masks were immediately taken off the shelves. Using no hyperbole, this inventory shortage created a national security risk as hospitals were running short themselves. In response, Vice President Mike Pence appealed to both Honeywell and 3M (NYSE:MMM) to step up production.Of course, this was a temporary catalyst for HON stock. Frankly, the news has only briefly benefited HON stock. At the same time, Honeywell offers many utilitarian products that may also rise in demand.As well, consumer priorities will likely shift because of this pandemic. Therefore, HON stock still has upside potential once this period of volatility fades. Home Depot (HD)Source: Mihai_Andritoiu / Shutterstock.com Perhaps no other retailer has received as much interest during this crisis as Costco (NASDAQ:COST). When Covid-19 started making headway at home, people bum rushed their local Costco stores to stock up on the essentials. But I think Home Depot (NYSE:HD) will start to get some love. Though HD stock - like so many others -saw red in March, the underlying company is a vital cog in our communities.If you think about it, Home Depot is like the U.S. Postal Service. Through hurricanes, earthquakes and other Acts of God, Home Depot is open to serve the core needs of the public. Once people go through their 800 gallons of mayonnaise, they'll realize that home renovations don't wait for pandemics.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy After the Seismic Market Shift Whether it's light bulbs that need replacing or a smoke detector that won't shut up, Home Depot has got your back. Therefore, this is a great time to consider HD stock. Dynatrace (DT)Source: Shutterstock As cases of Covid-19 began spreading across the U.S., many companies urged their employees to work from home. Thus, the concept of telecommuting is no longer an alien luxury. In many states, it remains a mandatory order. In this environment, you have many obvious names to pick from. But investors may want to take a look at Dynatrace (NYSE:DT) and DT stock.A new name, Dynatrace had its initial public offering in summer 2019 and it's made a huge impact. What makes them stand out is not just that they offer enterprise-level, all-in-one cloud-based solutions but that they have resilient infrastructure that enables apps supported on their platform to perform on demand, all the time. As everyone works from home, this resilience is a critical factor.Plus, this outbreak gives Dynatrace the opportunity to showcase its advantages over the competition. Don't get me wrong, there's risk involved with a new name like DT stock. Still, this is also one of the more compelling names among coronavirus stocks to buy. Zoom Video Communications (ZM)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com Admittedly, most of the coronavirus stocks to buy that are featured on this list have seen wicked volatility. When Wall Street panics, few are left unscathed. I hate to use this hackneyed phrase but it is what it is. However, Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) has decisively bucked this trend. On a year-to-date basis, ZM stock has jumped 107%.To be fair, skeptics may point out that Zoom will lose its luster after the coronavirus fades. But on the other hand, delays in the federal response contributed to the U.S. becoming the coronavirus epicenter. Therefore, key states such as California or New York are reluctant to reopen their states.  * 8 Best Performing Stocks During the 2020's Market Meltdown In other words, that's a lot of people suddenly forced to telecommute. And that might not change for some time. Cynically, Zoom has the nation's biggest hostage audience. Honestly, this is a huge deal for ZM stock. Aflac (AFL)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com From the get-go, I'm going to say that you shouldn't rush to buy supplemental insurance provider Aflac (NYSE:AFL). As the weeks turn into months, the company is likely to face several claims. At the same time, the markets are back in turmoil. Not surprisingly, the federal government has thrown everything they have at this pandemic.In turn, such actions will likely reduce yields, which does not help AFL stock. To quickly summarize, insurance companies take premiums from their clients and invest the money into high-quality, low-risk investments. However, low yields kill returns in these vehicles.So, why am I talking about AFL stock in this gallery of coronavirus stocks to buy? It goes back to my previous argument: the Covid-19 pandemic could permanently change people's behavior, resulting in greater demand for supplemental insurance.I would just wait for the present volatility to calm before considering a position in Aflac. Sturm Ruger (RGR)Source: Shutterstock Guns are controversial. Personally, I believe the Second Amendment should stand as is because let's face it: you can't depend on the government for anything. Indeed, the delayed Covid-19 response and the general sense of confusion across the political aisle proves this point. As well, fears of social unrest have bolstered Sturm Ruger (NYSE:RGR) and RGR stock.Predictably, millions of Americans have stocked up on firearms and ammo. Amid this frenzied buying, though, is a curious demographic: Asian Americans. Fearing a racist backlash for the coronavirus - and our leadership isn't helping matters here - many of them are now armed.Good for them and for all Americans who take their personal safety seriously. If you want to depend on your local law enforcement agency to protect you, that's also fine. But I think we can all agree that RGR stock is a very relevant name right now.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies. Over the past several years, he has delivered unique, critical insights for the investment markets, as well as various other industries including legal, construction management, and healthcare. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-04-17	2020-04-17 13:46:35	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Big Earnings Day As Honeywell, Procter & Gamble, Schlumberger Among Those Reporting	"A glimmer of hope surfaced overnight in the form of promising coronavirus treatment results from a Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) study, but people shouldn't get carried away.Though the medical news is exciting and the market obviously loves it, some analysts expressed caution. They noted it was a study with no control group, meaning no untreated group of similar patients given a placebo. It's also partial data, not final results. That doesn't mean it isn't worth noting, only that it probably takes more information to really move the needle. GILD expects additional data to become available next month, Reuters reported.Whether or not additional data shows efficacy, it's amazing to see just how much the overall market is responding to any good news right now. It's possible evidence that more of a ""risk-on"" attitude permeates Wall Street after last month's incredible flight toward safety. GILD shares recently rose double digits, and Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) shares rose sharply as the jet-maker said it plans to reopen production at its Seattle plant. That means 27,000 people coming back to work, which is great news.The market also seems to be getting a lift from President Trump presenting a plan last night to reopen the economy in three stages.More disappointing, but hardly unexpected, were some data that appeared overnight. Chinese Q1 economic growth slid 6.8%. It was the first economic shrinkage acknowledged in official statistics since 1976. No real surprise there, and it does reflect some pretty dramatic measures China took to slow the virus. What's going to maybe be more interesting is to see what Q2 growth does, now that the country is reopening the economy. Anyway, the news doesn't appear to be having much impact on the market. In crude, there was a contract roll-over last night and it's interesting to see the June CME crude contract (/CLM20) trading near $25 a barrel and barely down for the day. The old May contract expires Tuesday and is more than $6 below the June. Seeing the June contract take the baton with this kind of premium arguably is a sign of economic hope, because higher crude prices in the future suggest firmer global demand. Contracts even farther out are well up into the mid-$30s. This could be a relationship to keep an eye on over time. Another thing to potentially keep an eye on today is Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), which got a big downgrade from Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS). So far, it doesn't appear to be affecting shares.It's been a good week so far, if we can hold this. Last week we had a synthetic Friday (on Thursday) due to the holiday, and things went well. But Fridays have been interesting lately. The last hour of the session could be where things get volatile, and also check to see if there's profit-taking right out of the gate. From a technical perspective, it would be good to see the S&P 500 Index (SPX) hold 2850 by the close. Healthy Check-Up Considering the nature of the global crisis, you might expect the Healthcare sector to be a robust performer. It was exactly that on Thursday, topping the sector leaderboard with a bigger than 2% rise. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) delivered firm Q1 results this week and generated some excitement with its coronavirus testing kits and the stock rolled to new 52-week highs. Something to keep in mind about testing in general, whichever company you're looking at, is these tests tend to be on the cheaper side and may not be big revenue contributors in the great scheme of things.However, if companies can find a way to meet what's expected to be huge demand, they might make up in volume what they lack in price. A company like ABT arguably has the manufacturing bandwidth and financial strength to take big advantage of this, so that's something to consider watching. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) could have a similar scenario addressing the coronavirus vaccine business. No Punishment For Guidance Withdrawal Another thing investors saw with earnings this week is companies like ABT and others pulling their guidance. The economic picture remains too cloudy for anyone to risk giving out numbers now only to change them later and confuse investors. In normal times, a company pulling or declining to give guidance would raise a red flag about possible internal or industry problems. That's not necessarily the case now because there's one big global challenge affecting everyone. Having said that, companies may come under pressure to distribute clearer roadmaps by Q2 earnings season when hopefully the horizon is less foggy. That may be easier for some industries than others, with travel and tourism, Financials, and retail maybe among the ones that could have more challenges than others given the nature of their businesses. Thursday's choppy session ended up on the positive side of the ledger for most major indices, but the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (RUT) continued to struggle as investors worried about the impact on smaller businesses and regional banks (see more below).On Sunny Days, Technology Rolls Up Big Gains As on a lot of recent up-days, Technology found plenty of buyers Thursday, led by some of the big bruisers like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), as well as chip-makers including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Many investors appear to be listening to analysts who talk about the importance of finding big names with enough liquidity to possibly weather this situation. As Briefing.com pointed out in a note Thursday, it's almost a ""Darwinian"" approach playing out among people in the markets.The Nasdaq (COMP), which so many of those tech stocks call home, is actually up almost 7% year-over-year, and that includes a 30% plunge between mid-February and mid-March. It's pretty amazing to look at that chart. While most major indices turned higher yesterday, the 10-year Treasury yield slipped to just over 0.6%, down from the mid-0.7% range last week, in a sign that some investors might be continuing to put their trust in bonds over stocks.The SPX finished just a smidgen shy of 2800 on Thursday and looks to open well above that Friday. That's a level to consider watching next week, too, because it represents approximately a 50% recovery from the March lows back to the February highs and could form an area of technical support.  CHART OF THE DAY: GETTING IN RANGE? For a while there a few weeks ago, it was hard to trade the market because volatility had the S&P 500 Index (SPX--candlestick) gyrating up and down like a jumping bean. Now that volatility has eased a bit, a trading range appears to be forming between the 20-day moving average down near 2570 (yellow line) and the 50-day moving average up around 2870 (red line). The 200-day moving average is the blue line just above 3000. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices.  Chart Source: The thinkorswimÂ® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Taking a Long Look at Volatility: The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) remained just above 40 by the end of the day Thursday, but it almost felt like nostalgia seeing the most major indices move less than 1%. They've already had more 1% or moves this year than they typically have in an entire 12 months, and investors might be getting tired of the whipsaw action. That said, when you see VIX at 40 or above, that's double the long-term average, meaning we can likely expect volatility to continue at high rates over the coming month. After that, the VIX futures complex indicates that traders expect volatility to slowly ease but still not get back to near normal any time this year. VIX futures trade at above 30 through the October 2020 contract as of Thursday, falling to just below 30 for the November and December contracts. At this point, anything under 40 seems relatively mild compared to record-high VIX closes above 80 last month. Even 40, though, is still pretty thin air compared to when VIX traded near 12 earlier this year.Remember, VIX is sometimes called the ""fear index"" because when the S&P 500 Index (SPX) comes under pressure, the demand for SPX put options increases, which often pushes VIX higher. The VIX is the market's collective estimate of how much the price of the SPX might move up or down over the succeeding 30 days. So a VIX at 14.00 should be interpreted as a 14% annualized level of volatility.Earnings Calendar Starts Filling Up Next Week: Today's earnings included The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) and Schlumberger Limited (NYSE: SLB), providing early looks at how one of the big Consumer Staples companies and a major oil field services company are weathering the crisis. Staples have generally been strong as people stock up, while oil fields languish as crude remained at 18-year lows toward the end of the week.SLB shares got a nice boost in pre-market trading after narrowly beating analysts' average earnings per share estimate. PG earnings per share beat Wall Street's estimates, but revenue came in slightly below. Oil field service companies like SLB and Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) saw their shares ride higher earlier this month, but the last week has been tough. Like the cruise ship companies, fundamentals continue to work against any lasting rally. Honeywell International, Inc. (NYSE: HON) also reported results today. The calendar next week includes Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), which made new 52-week highs again Thursday as streaming services remain appealing to many investors (and to many of us stuck at home in front of our screens). Other major companies due to report next week include IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM), AT&T, Inc. (NYSE: T), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL), Visa, Inc. (NYSE: V), Eli Lilly and  Company (NASDAQ: LLY), and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: UAL). The following week, earnings really get busy. Things are just starting, so strap in. Smaller Banks Pressure RUT: Drilling down a little further, the weak consumer could be one reason the regional bank-heavy Russell 2000 Index (RUT) continues to lag the broader market. Investors likely are worried about the medium-sized and smaller banks' huge exposure to small business and mortgage loans as the jobless rate climbs and stores and restaurants remain closed. It's hard to see the RUT getting much traction even longer term, because so many analysts expect the recovery to be slow even once things start opening again. Many small businesses might go out of business altogether, and yesterday's dramatically weak housing number could mean trouble for banks trying to make a living with mortgage lending. RUT is getting a boost in pre-market trading this morning, with CME's Russell 2000 futures contract (/RTY) having traded at its overnight limit, up about 5%.See more from Benzinga  * Bleak Picture: Steep Crude Demand Plunge Dogs Energy Industry as Q1 Earnings Results Loom  * Morgan Stanley Misses On EPS, But Shows Strong Trading Results For Q1 As Banks Wrap Up  * Netflix Earnings Preview: With Consumers On Lockdown, Streaming Giant Filling The Void(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-04-15	2020-04-15 12:30:23	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Fastenal Is One Company That Got Pandemic Planning Right	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As a distributor of factory-floor basics, Fastenal Co.âs earnings are typically a reasonable guideÂ of what's to come when its manufacturing customers report results a few weeks later, andÂ that should hold even in theÂ coronavirus era. But listening to the companyâs conference call on Tuesday to discuss its first-quarter results, I was struck by a differentÂ kind of roadmap: In step-by-step fashion, CEO Dan Florness laid out Fastenal's response to the coronavirus crisis, offering a case studyÂ onÂ best practices whenÂ preparingÂ for the disruptions of a pandemic.Fastenal is little known outside of industrial circles, but it's essentially in the business of supply-chain management, and it acted on the warning signs of the coronavirus crisis much faster than the federal government. That's partly a reflection of the nature of Fastenal's supply chain, which is weighted heavily toward Asia, the first frontier ofÂ the outbreak.Â Way back in January, asÂ the spread of the virus forced China into lockdown, Fastenal began monitoring certain product lines to ensure a reliable flow of goods for its customers, Florness said Tuesday as he kicked off the earnings conversation.Â This is around the time that an array of top government officials began warning of the risks the coronavirus posed to the U.S., even as President Donald Trump publicly downplayed the threat and the prospect of upheaval to Americansâ daily lives, according to a detailed report from the New York Times.The initial focus of theÂ administration's coronavirus task force (formally announcedÂ on Jan. 29) was on keeping infected Chinese people out of the U.S., not on testing or supplies,Â the Washington Post reported. Procurement has since become the government's biggest problem. The federal stockpile of key medical equipment is woefully inadequate to address a pandemic on the scale of the coronavirus and governors across the country have been forced to compete against each other on the open market for masks and ventilators. Fastenal, by contrast, has recent experience when it comes to a nimble rethinking of supply chains, thanks in part to Trump's trade wars. âQuite frankly, after the tariffs became a thing, we began to beat the bushes for additional suppliers outside of China,â CFO Holden Lewis said in a phone interview Tuesday. âI'd love to tell you we moved at lightning pace specificallyÂ related to the coronavirus,Â but we already had the platform in place that allowed us to react to this in the way that we have.&quot; The companyâs Asian procurement and quality-control infrastructure has been in place for years.Fastenal soundedÂ internal alarms on Feb. 6 for all of its employeesÂ to prepare to marshalÂ resources and vet backup suppliers for certainÂ janitorial and protective-gear products it sells. âIt's an unforeseen problem,&quot; Trump said of the virus on March 6 as he signed an initial spending bill that included just $3.1 billion to stockpile medical supplies. &quot;Came out of nowhere.âÂ Federal agencies largely waited until mid-March to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health-care workers, according to a review ofÂ purchasing contracts byÂ the Associated Press. By that point, Fastenal had moved to limit the salesÂ of certain key cleaning and health-care products to critical industries to help ensure that the goods made it to the workers that needed them the most. While the government has sporadically invoked the Defense Production Act to spur companies into ramping up the production of ventilators and masks, a concrete plan regarding the distribution of this vital equipment among the states was late in development and is still lacking.Fastenal's efforts to procure alternative sources of personal protective equipment and funnel goods to those most in need has meant that its supply chain is &quot;pretty filled,â CFO Lewis said on the earnings call Tuesday. &quot;Right now we still have product that weâre going to be working through delivering throughout most of April.&quot; Ultimately, these effortsÂ may even help the company bring in new business, CEOÂ Florness said. There are multiple examples of customers reaching out to the Fastenalâs sales team, saying ââI get what your supply-chain resources are about more than everÂ from what Iâve seen firsthand over the last three weeks,ââ he said. Imagine what the world would be like right now if governors were praising the Trump administration's supply-chain resources rather than desperately pleading for needed goodsÂ and evaluating sending in the state national guard to protect shipments of masks from seizure by the federal government.Â This is not the only front on which Fastenal has been ahead of the curve. Like many other companies, it didnât wait for federal government orders to implement social-distancing measures. On March 6, Fastenal canceled an annual sales event that was meant to take place in mid-April. Doing so deprived it of one of its biggest opportunities to ink new contracts for its onsite supply-chain services andÂ vending machinesÂ  â and itâs one reason why 2020 growth prospects areÂ âmurky,â Florness said. But it was the &quot;prudentâ thing to do, he said.Â The weekend of March 14, the company closed off public access toÂ its retail locations.(1) That Monday, March 16, theÂ Trump administration announced national guidelines to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including avoidingÂ gatherings of more than 10 people. Fastenal has also expanded paid time-off for both full-Â and part-time employees to deal with coronavirus disruptions.Â All of this hasn't saved Fastenal from the coronavirus. While sales of safety products jumped 31% in March, revenue from Fastenalâs traditional fasteners business plunged 10.1% as factories, amusement parks, retail outlets and schools shuttered. On average,Â daily sales across the company increased 0.2% in March, a marked drop from the 4.7% pace in February. And because safety products are typically lower-margin, that contributed to the 110 basis-point drop in the first quarter in the percentage of sales Fastenal converts into gross profit. Still, the coronavirus crisis is different than the 2009 recession because at least demand is increasing for some products. April sales are down about 10.5% to date, which is relatively mild in the scheme of things and encouragingÂ ahead ofÂ results due later this monthÂ from companies such as 3M Co. and Honeywell International Inc. While headcount may decline, Fastenal indicated that at this point, any cuts are unlikely to be of the magnitude they were back in 2009. The margin dislocation also will likely fix itself once demand for fasteners bounces back and the need for protective gear eases.Â Fastenal may be leaving some money on the table when it comes to safety and cleaning products, but it put in strict pricing guidelines early on in the process &quot;because we're more interested in getting through this and getting society through it and getting back to whatever the new normal is,â Florness said. In more ways than one, this is a company that got pandemic planning right.Â (1) Most of the company's business comes through onsite or delivery services that remain operational for those customers serving critical industries, but profit margins tend to be higher for products purchased through its retail locations, so the closure cost the company on that front.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-04-13	2020-04-13 14:59:05	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	A Look Into Honeywell's Price Over Earnings	Right now, Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) share price is at $139.06, after a 3% decrease. Over the past month, the stock went up by 5.51%, but over the past year, it actually decreased by 14.61%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio.The stock is currently higher from its 52 week low by 37.58%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Specialty Industrial Machinery stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 19.3 in the specialty industrial machinery industry, Honeywell has a lower P/E ratio of 17.05. Shareholders might be inclined to think that they might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.P/E ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance. Depending on the earnings makeup of a company, investors may be unable to attain key insights from trailing earnings.See more from Benzinga  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * P/E Ratio Insights for Bank of America  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Lows On Monday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-04-12	2020-04-12 14:13:25	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Honeywell Secures $1.5 Billion Revolving Credit Line	Honeywell International Inc. (HON) said it had entered into a revolving credit agreement for $1.5 billion, to be used for general corporate purposes when needed.Citibank (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the underwriters of the 364-day credit agreement, Honeywell said in a filing. Funds borrowed against the revolving credit agreement need be repaid no later than April 9, 2021, the company said.The industrial conglomerate, which makes everything from aircraft engine parts to warehouse automation equipment, informed investors that the loan does not restrict its ability to pay a dividend, nor does it contain financial covenants.Jairam Nathan, analyst at Daiwa Securities last month upgraded Honeywell to Buy from Hold with a $129 price target. Nathan noted that although 2020 is expected to be a âtough yearâ, given the companyâs exposure to aerospace and project-based revenues, it is well-positioned with a âsolid balance sheet and stronger diversified portfolio to weather the downturn, which current valuations are not reflectingâ.Other Wall Street analysts are also upbeat about Honeywell stock assigning a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buys and 3 Holds. The $159.25 average price target forecasts Honeywell shares will rise 11% in the coming 12 months. (See Honeywell stock analysis on TipRanks) Â The agreement comes after Honeywell on March 31 reported that it completed a two-year $6 billion loan agreement to bolster liquidity amid expectations that global economic conditions will persist or worsen this year due to the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic.As of the end of 2019, the company had $10 billion in cash, with its pension liability overfunded, it said in the March statement. Separately, Honeywell said last month that it was ramping up operations to produce millions of N95 disposable respirators to help support the need for the protective face masks.Related News:  S&P Cuts General Electricâs Credit Outlook to Negative Amid Debt Concern  Google, Apple Join Forces to Develop Coronavirus Tracking Technology  Microsoftâs Bill Gates to Spend Billions of Dollars on Coronavirus Vaccine Development More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * United Airlines Seeks To Raise $1B With Massive Share Sale   * 5-Star Analyst Pounds the Table on Microsoft (MSFT) Stock   * Travelers Sees Premium Volumes âNegativelyâ Impacted in 2Q   * Goldman Sachs Sees Doom and Gloom in These 3 Tech Stock Giants	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/honeywell-secures-1-5-billion-141325053.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-09	2020-04-09 18:38:14	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	The Best Buy Opportunity in Lakeland Industries Stock Is Long Gone	Amid the devastation from the novel coronavirus comes changes to our lexicon. Today, Americans are all too familiar with the term &quot;social distancing.&quot; But another phrase has far more crucial implications: personal protective equipment (PPE). With medical professionals and first responders throughout the nation struggling to address the pandemic, Lakeland Industries (NASDAQ:LAKE), a hazard-protection gear manufacturer, has come into the spotlight. As a result, it's no wonder that Lakeland Industries stock has skyrocketed.At the beginning of the year, shares were trading hands just below $11. At its intraday peak, Lakeland Industries stock was approaching the $30 level. Although it didn't quite get there, the surge in momentum symbolized the arrival of a paradigm shift. With the rapidly rising equity price came the realization that this was no longer a foreign problem.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo further emphasize our new normal, hospitals in hard-hit states became quickly overwhelmed with thousands of daily Covid-19 cases. Although the Trump administration made appeals to companies like 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) to provide critical PPE, the virus spread faster than many experts anticipated. Unfortunately, this led to hospitals in New York having to come to grips with the fact that they must do without protective equipment.Given the tremendous humanitarian need, this circumstance naturally bolstered the profile of Lakeland Industries stock. Essentially, the coronavirus forced all PPE companies to think in patriotic terms. Furthering this concept, President Trump in early April invoked the Defense Production Act to prevent the export of surgical masks and gloves.Later, the federal government doubled down on this warning. While this environment helps Lakeland Industries stock, the longer-term outlook is questionable. Lakeland Industries Stock No Longer Has Low-hanging FruitIn early March, my colleague Louis Navellier mentioned that LAKE featured solid fundamentals before the pandemic. Obviously, the company today carries the same fundamentals along with a huge uptick in technical sentiment. Further, more investors will likely continue to keep tabs on Lakeland Industries stock after this virus passes.  * 7 Penny Stocks To Buy with Massive Upside Potential Certainly, I don't think shares will go to zero. As Navellier stated, the company was relevant before Covid-19 and will be so afterward. Indeed, whether we go back to the old normal or enter a new one, we won't soon forget about PPEs.But does that mean you should buy Lakeland Industries stock at this point? I have serious reservations, primarily because the low-hanging fruit is all gone.For this argument, a visual aid is most appropriate. In this chart, I compare Lakeland Industries stock to worldwide coronavirus cases. As you can see, Wall Street early birds were closely watching developments in China back in January of this year. Gambling on a big outbreak, they bid shares up to $16.10 from $10.97 -- a near-47% increase.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Matt McCall Research Team However, sentiment quickly declined as it appeared at one point that the coronavirus could be contained in China. Soon, though, it became apparent that the crisis would deteriorate into a pandemic. In the second half of February, shares surged to $21.11 from $12.05 -- a 75.2% lift.At the time, the move wasn't completely unjustified. Since the end of February, the coronavirus has virtually impacted every corner of the world.However, from late February to April 7, global coronavirus cases increased 1,591%. A big jump, yes, but consider that from late January to late February, cases increased nearly 14,500%.In other words, you'd be buying LAKE toward the end of this crisis. Just Do the MathOf course, I'm not an epidemiologist and I don't claim to know when this crisis will fade exactly. But that's not my point. Rather, I'm discussing the sentiment toward LAKE stock and how it relates to Covid-19 trends.As you can see from the chart, sentiment for the stock has consistently led the rise in coronavirus cases. To put it another way, the massive burst in market value came from investor anticipation. In hindsight, these speculators accurately predicted the first two waves of Covid-19 infections.But will the third time be the charm? I doubt it.You don't have to be a medical expert to know that all health-related hazards eventually fade with time. Mathematically, the cases have already sharply decelerated. If you buy Lakeland Industries stock now, you're gambling that cases will continue to rise sharply.Yes, anything is possible. But with most U.S. jurisdictions (and several countries) imposing emergency shelter-in-place orders, that's a bet that I'm not willing to take.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

Some have done so as an alternative source of short-term financing due to rising costs in the commercial paper market.Read more: Wall Street is turning away some of Americaâs safest borrowersHoneywell said in its statement to Bloomberg that it still had access to the commercial paper market, and that its pension was overfunded.Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Karen Ubelhart said Monday that the company was well-positioned to weather a global recession because of its diverse markets and strong operations. Honeywell also has more than $10 billion of cash on balance sheet, Ubelhart added.Honeywell is a relatively high-quality company, with credit ratings that sit five steps above junk by Moodyâs Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings. Credit-default swaps insuring the companyâs debt for five years have jumped to 43 basis points as of Monday from 26 basis points at the beginning of March amid a sell-off in credit, according to ICE Data Services.The U.S. industrial conglomerate, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, released a disappointing sales forecast in January before the Covid-19 virus hit as an industrial slowdown crimped revenue growth. Honeywellâs aerospace unit sales had already been hurt by the production halt of Boeing Co.âs grounded 737 Max.âAs the coronavirus halts global growth, Honeywell faces pressure in aerospace after-market sales, which represent 41% of its largest and most profitable segment,â Ubelhart said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/honeywell-said-discuss-5-billion-220818704.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-03-23	2020-03-23 19:49:57	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	âHeavy Hand of Governmentâ Is Just What Crisis Needs	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- âWe are getting what we want without the heavy hand of government,â said Peter Navarro, the White House economist whoâs been put in charge of speeding up the manufacture of medical equipment that hospitals Â need so desperately.It was around 6:30 Sunday night when Navarro made that remark, about a third of the way through the White Houseâs daily coronavirus press briefing. It struck me as a fitting end to one of the most anxiety-ridden weekends of my life, comparable, I suspect, to the way my parents must have felt during the Cuban missile crisis. My wife, Dawn, has a relative living in New York, a young health-care professional who has been working around the clock since the coronavirus hit the city. She called us Saturday to say that she was feeling feverish and tired â she thought she might have Covid-19. She had put herself in self-quarantine and was being tested on Monday. Her father was sending her toilet paper from Wisconsin.A good friend of Dawn, the legal journalist David Lat, a 44-year-old man who suffers from exercise-induced asthma, was on a ventilator after contracting the virus, fighting for his life. A few weeks earlier, Dawn had planned to introduce him to a new client, but at the last minute, the client decided not to fly in from San Francisco. All weekend long, I kept thinking about that canceled meeting â about how lucky we were that the client had decided to stay home. I also have asthma, and Iâm considerably older than Lat. The point is everyone has similar connections and weâre all anxious and afraid; and weâre all looking to the White House for leadership about the best way to deal with this crisis.This is what we got instead: At the press conference, Navarro was talking about the Defense Production Act, a law that gives the president the power to direct industrial production. Five days earlier, President Donald Trump had âinvokedâ the Act, but he was clearly reluctant to actually use it. I couldnât understand why â and I was hardly alone.Now, here was the answer: The act, in the view of the Trump administration, represented not a tool that could help the country mobilize against the unseen enemy but âthe heavy hand of government.â Really? Despite the dire straits the country is in, this Republican administration is being guided by classic Republican ideology, not common sense.When it was time for the media to question the president, a reporter asked Trump why he wasnât using the act, noting that governors across the country âwere pleadingâ with him to start using it.Astonishingly, Trump claimed that using it would mean nationalizing businesses, even citing the example of Venezuela (âCall a person in Venezuela and ask them how did the nationalization of their businesses work out.â) Plus, he said, it would send âtremors though our business community.â The mere fact that the Defense Production Act had been invoked, he insisted, was causing businesses like General Motors and Honeywell to step up.Finally, there was this excuse, which nearly caused me to throw my iPad across the room: âIf we go out and we want masks, we donât know who to call on masks. But Hanes called us and said, âWeâre going to make millions of masks.ââ He continued, âIf we call a company to make a ventilator, they donât even know what a ventilator is.â And on and on and on.Imagine if President Franklin Roosevelt and his head of military production, William Knudsen (a former head of General Motors), had taken the same approach during World War II. What if instead of directing Ford to stop making cars and start making bombers, they waited for companies to volunteer to make this or that? Instead of figuring out which companies could do what, they waited for companies to tell them what they were capable of. By insisting on action, rather than hoping for it, the U.S. was able to transform 30% of its industrial might to military production. It was a huge factor in winning the war.Of the many articles about the crisis I read during the weekend, the one that stuck with me the most was about the critical shortage of ventilators. Written by Daniel M. Horn, a young doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital, it shows, implicitly but powerfully, why Trumpâs free-market fundamentalism is completely wrong for this moment.There are three issues that need to be solved, he wrote: âventilator production, ventilator distribution and ventilator operation.â He went on to say that he and other doctors had been receiving texts saying things like, âMy company makes parts for GE ventilators.â And he noted that GM was helping a small ventilator company scale up. Tech leaders, he added, were calling hospitals asking for ventilator specs. But to pull all this together, Horn wrote, âwe need a plan.âDitto for distribution and operation. Which hospitals should get the ventilators? How many? How would they be delivered? Horn suggested a âcloud-based national ventilator surveillance platformâ built by one of the big tech companies and managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Again, someone would have to draw up a plan and then see that it is executed.As for operations, more people would be needed to run these machines than are now available. Using one does not appear to be rocket science, but it does require training. Who will do that training? How will their competence be certified?Reading Hornâs article, I was struck by how much the federal government could do if it could only cast off its ideological blinders. Suppose Trump appointed a ventilator czar and gave him or her the power to employ the Defense Production Act. Instead of waiting for companies to come to him, he could seek out the companies that made the most sense for adapting factories to make ventilators. He could designate which company would make the surveillance platform and how it would operate. Skills-based community colleges could be given the task for training operators. None of this will happen without the governmentâs willingness to take charge â and yes, to use the act.(A quick aside: late Sunday night, as I was thinking about this, it occurred to me that this would be a perfect role for Ash Carter, President Barack Obamaâs Secretary of Defense. Before taking the top job he was the assistant secretary for acquisition, technology and logistics â exactly the skills that are so desperately needed now in the Trump administration. But of course he was an Obama man, so it will never happen.)What is stunning is how passive the administration is, how lacking in urgency, even now. States have to fend for themselves. People have to fend for themselves. On Monday, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he and other Democratic lawmakers would introduce legislation to federalize the medical supply chain.In his press conferences, Trump is constantly talking about how fast things are happening and how quickly progress is being made, but we all know itâs not true.Â He is, in fact, urgent about one thing: reviving the stock market. Iâm now reading articles that the president wants to end social distancing soon and push people back to work, even if the virus is still among us. âWe cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,â he tweeted â in all caps â just before midnight on Sunday.You know what we boomers used to say: âYouâre either part of the solution or part of the problem.â In the two months since the coronavirus hit U.S. shores, the Trump administration remains part of the problem.(Corrects spelling of a company identified by President Trump in the eighth paragraph.Â )This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2020-03-20	2020-03-20 16:34:25	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	3M Stock Is an Attractive Defensive Play	With its shares down more than 24% since January, is 3M (NYSE:MMM) stock a buy? The market maelstrom has made blue-chip names like this industrial conglomerate worth buying. A true &quot;dividend aristocrat,&quot; the stock now sports a healthy 4.3% yield. But that's not all! Since the stock's valuation is reasonable, it gives investors a chance to own a high-quality stock at a fair price. Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com The question is if the market has reached a bottom. Fear and uncertainty continue to plague investors. Even though markets may drop further,  3M is a defensive stock, so it could provide investors with a good opportunity.Let's dive in and see why MMM stock could be a buy at today's prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Why Consider MMM Stock Today?It makes sense for investors to be skeptical of 3M stock. As InvestorPlace columnist Tom Taulli noted in his column published on Mar. 11, the company has a few ongoing catalysts at this point.  Many could think the coronavirus from China would boost the company, since 3M makes respiratory masks. But, with its revenue from coronavirus-related products projected to be just $250 million, they probably won't be a needle-mover for the company.If anything, coronavirus is as much a negative catalyst for MMM stock as it is for other big industrial names. Since much of 3M's  revenue comes from China, that nation's slow recovery will make 3M's path forward difficult. And that is on top of the company's existing operating challenges.  * 10 Stocks to Invest In for a Post-Coronavirus Whipsaw Between 2018 and 2019, its sales dipped from $32.8 billion to $32.1 billion. In the same time frame, its net income dropped from $5.4 billion to $4.6 billion. Clearly, the company needs to get back on the growth train. But, after 3M lowered its 2020 profit forecast, don't expect that to happen anytime soon.Upbeat catalysts may be a stretch, but how about the stock's valuation? 3M's shares look reasonably priced, with a forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.2. Granted, its peers, including Honeywell (NYSE:HON), sell at similar valuations (Honeywell has a forward P/E ratio of 15). Other industrial conglomerates, like General Electric (NYSE:GE) sell at even lower forward multiples (GE's forward P/E is 12.9).So, with minimal catalysts and a fair, but not a low, valuation, why should investors buy MMM stock today? Simply put, they could take advantage of a likely future flight-to-safety trend . As a Seeking Alpha contributor recently noted, 3M has historically been a great defensive stock. Add in the stock's strong dividend (see below), and the shares offer investors a lot. Buy for the Dividend, Stay for the Rebound?The key positive trait of MMM stock is its dividend. It's increased its dividend 61 years in a row. With its high yield, the stock is one of the best blue-chip dividend plays out there.Yet 3M's payout ratio is a concern. The company now pays out 62% of its earnings in the form of dividends. Since its earnings may dip this year, it's possible that the company will tighten its belt. I don't think 3M, which has increased its annual payout by an average of 11% over the last five years, will reduce or cut its dividend. The company, however, may increase its payout more modestly than 11%.Nevertheless, 3M's dividend may be one of the safer ones out there. With blue chips like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) rumored to be planning dividend cuts, income investors should consider more stable opportunities than that venerable oil company.3M stock could also be a &quot;buy for the dividend, stay for the rebound&quot; opportunity. I'm not the only one who thinks the stock could rally tremendously. Melius Research's Scott Davis upgraded 3M's shares last month from &quot;hold&quot; to &quot;buy,&quot; giving the stock a $205 per share price target.While $205 per share seems rich compared to the stock's  current prices, Davis believes the company's businesses, which were already in a down cycle, are about to improve. But analysts concede that the company still faces several risks, besides China's slow recovery. For one, the company's potential liabilities from its past use of PFAS (polyfluoroalkyl) substances could hurt it. Gordon Haskett's John Inch believes 3M's total PFAS liability could top $15 billion. Yet all of these negative factors could already be priced into the shares, considering their poor performance in 2019, even as the S&P 500 made new highs. 3M Is a Long-Term Buy at Today's PricesWeighing opportunities against risk, 3M at first glance doesn't look like a strong buy. Despite respirator masks flying off shelves, 3M's potential revenue from them isn't exactly a needle-mover. Factoring in recent risks like coronavirus, along with past issues such as weak sales growth and PFAS liabilities, investors should be cautious.Yet much of these issues could already be priced into the shares. With 3M stock already &quot;priced for disaster,&quot; investors can buy the stock now and start collecting an above-average dividend yield. Once the markets rebound, the stock could soar back to its prior level of around $175 per share.That won't happen tomorrow. It may not happen six months from now. But over the long-term, MMM stock could make an epic rebound.  At today's distressed prices, its shares may now be a good opportunity for shrewd investors.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.

2020-03-16	2020-03-16 13:23:17	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	U.S. Factories Helped Win World War II. They Can Do It Again.	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When youâre in a critical fight, you need to use all the weapons at your disposal. And so,Â itâs time once again for America toÂ marshalÂ itsÂ great arsenal of democracy. Just as Detroit automakers became aircraft, tank and gun manufacturers during World War II, todayâs industrial companies need to repurpose their factories for the tools needed to fight the current enemy: the coronavirus.Countries across the globe sealed their borders over the weekend and relegated citizens to the confines of their homes in an effort to slow the spread of the deadly virus before it overwhelms the Western Worldâs health-care systems. The president of Massachusetts General Hospital called on Sunday for the federal government to go into a âwar-like stanceâ and launch a âManhattan Projectâ to accelerate production of protective gear. No such plan has been announced by the Trump administration, but U.S. industrial companies should heed the call anyway. Because as far as wars go, this is one for which the country is woefully unprepared.The U.S. has fewer than 170,000 ventilators available for patient care, including estimates for thoseÂ in the national stockpile, according to a report last month from the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. (The school is supported byÂ MichaelÂ Bloomberg,Â founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.)Â The number of face masks in that strategic reserve wasÂ depleted in the swine-flu outbreak of 2009 andÂ as of early March it held only about 12 million N95 respirators and 30 million surgical masks, significantly fewer than the 3.5 billion masks experts estimate the U.S. would need in a severe pandemic, according to the Washington Post. It falls to private manufacturers to step in and fill the void.With airlines parking jets, consumers locked in their homes and companies focusing on managing the disruption, demand for jet engines, HVAC systems and factory equipment is going to shrivel up for the near future. Rather than sit idle, American factories should be redeployed for the products needed to fight the coronavirus, whether thatâs face masks, ventilators, other health-care equipment or even toilet paper for that matter. The Trump administration has already leaned heavily on companies such as Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings, Roche Holding AG and Walmart Inc. to improve the availability and access toÂ testing. But White House virus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx warned on Sunday that there will be a spike in cases as more people get access to tests. Thatâs when the real work is going to begin for the nationâs hospitals. Itâs in every U.S. companyâs interest to make sure theyâre as prepared as possible, and manufacturers have a key role to play.Â Companies such as 3M Co. and Honeywell International Inc. already make masks and personal-protective gear, but they will need help to meet the huge demand.After China declared a âpeopleâs warâ on the outbreak in that country, companies including electric automaker BYD Co., petroleum refiner Sinopec and iPhone assembler Foxconn started making masks instead. French luxury-goods maker LVMH announced Sunday itâs convertingÂ perfume and cosmeticsÂ factories to make hand sanitizer, which it will deliver free of charge to the local authorities andÂ hospital system. In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson is calling on manufacturers including Dyson, Unipart Group, Honda and Ford to help with that countryâs ventilator shortage, according to the Financial Times. American companies need to follow this lead. Apart from the moral and patriotic implications, itâs just good business sense. The faster the world responds to this health crisis, the faster it can get back on its feet.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-03-10	2020-03-10 17:24:09	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Airlines Are Sounding Alarms. Shouldnât Suppliers, Too?	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The last thing anyone needs in this coronavirus situation is more panic, but thereâs a notable gap between the alarmsÂ emanatingÂ fromÂ the airline industry and the sanguine attitude among the companies that supply their spare parts and maintenance work.Â Tuesday brought a flood of fresh warnings from U.S. carriers on canceled flights, with Delta Air Lines Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. following United Airlines Holdings Inc. in pulling their guidance for the year. All three carriers also announced plans to reduce their capital expenditure plans, with United saying spending could be deferred for up to four years. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines Co. CEO Gary Kelly warned of a sharp decline in bookings and said the company was &quot;seriously considering&quot; reducing its flight schedule, according to a Monday video message to employees viewed by the Wall Street Journal. &quot;The velocity and the severity of the decline is breathtaking,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no question this is a severe recession for our industry and for us, and it's a financial crisis.&quot; ByÂ contrast, aerospace supplier Honeywell International Inc. reiterated both its first-quarter and full-year guidance on Tuesday.Back in February, when the spread of the virus was escalating rapidly in China but was still mostly contained to Asia, I pondered whether this might be what finally takes the wind out of an aerospace boom that was starting to look overblown. I quoted a report from Vertical Research analyst Rob Stallard who pointed out that, âunfortunately, aerospace companies are normally the last to get the memo.â We may now be seeing that dynamic play out.Part of the problem is a natural information lag. Honeywell acknowledged that assumptions underlying its numbers â including minimal economic impact in China from the coronavirus and a macro environment consistent with the end of 2019 â were being challenged. But with sales already tending to be weighted toward the last month of the quarter, thereâs not enough visibility right now to give a more formal update to the numbers, Chief Financial Officer Greg Lewis said. The implicit takeaway seemed to be that guidance will likely need to be reduced; the company just isnât prepared to do so today and struck an optimistic tone that the ultimate damage could be relatively contained. United Technologies Corp., which is set to separate its aerospace arm from the Carrier climateÂ and Otis elevator units later this year, alsoÂ has been mum on the potential hit to its business as the virus has spread beyond Asia. Engine makers Safran SA and General Electric Co. have modeled a financial hit for the first quarter but nothing beyond that.The steady drumbeat of increasingly dire warnings out of airlines suggests this is going to get worse before it gets better. United President Scott Kirby said Tuesday that net U.S. bookings are down about 70% and the airline expects to see further deterioration. The wave of conference cancellations, including the JPMorgan Chase & Co. industrial conference he was speaking at, which was moved to a virtual format, has wiped out much of corporate travel, while the impact on leisure demand is likely to grow amid mounting public concern,Â Kirby said. While the Trump administration has pledged fiscal stimulus to prop up the virus-stricken economy âÂ and President Donald Trump on Tuesday indicatedÂ specific help to airlines and cruise lines âÂ  it remains unclear whatÂ that would look like.The capacity reductions so far closely track the spread and severity of the virus outbreaks. The deepest cuts are still in the Asia-Pacific region, with American yanking routesÂ to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong through October, while Delta plans on Pacific capacity being down 65% versus its original plan. But Europe is increasingly becomingÂ a no-fly zone as well, with American temporarily suspending certain service to Barcelona, Rome, Paris and Madrid, and DeltaÂ planning on as much as a 20% reduction in transatlantic flights. If the trend line for the virus holds and cases continue to rise exponentially in the U.S., it stands to reason that Americanâs 7.5% cut to domestic flights in April and Deltaâs as much as 15% reduction in capacity will be the beginning rather than the end of the retrenchment. United, which has cut 10% of its domestic schedule for April, said it would evaluate and cancel flights on a rolling 90-day basis until it sees signs of a demand recovery.The plunge in oil prices helps reduce one of airlines' biggest expenses, with Delta modeling $2 billion of savings for 2020. But even with that booster, airlines are looking at cutting costs to offset the financial blow from the demand drop.Â Delta is parking both wide-body and narrow-body aircraft and evaluating early retirements for its older fleet. That will lead to âsignificantâ savings on maintenance, executives said in a presentation Tuesday at the JPMorgan industrial conference. That means significantly less profits for the aerospace suppliers that rely on a lucrative stream of repair and spare-parts work.More troubling over the longer term is the risk that a sustained hit to demand starts to affect plane orders. Delta is deferring $500 million of capital expenditures largely tied to discretionary projects that can be put off with âno regrets,â executives said. But the company also said it has to take a look at aircraft deliveries, especially if the environment gets worse. Southwest is still planning on receiving deliveries of Boeing Co.âs grounded 737 Max jet in the third quarter, but Kelly cautioned in the employee video that the company will âmaintain all optionsâ if demand doesnât recover. Airbus SE is reportedly weighing whether to lower its target for 2020 deliveries and itâs worth mentioning that the deferral requests so far remain concentrated among Asian airlines.Honeywell CFO Lewis said the company continued to expect the coronavirus to be a short-term disruption and hopefully heâs right. But in situations like this, it helps to follow the money. And in that light, it feels notable that Southwestâs Kelly is taking a 10% pay cut and United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz and President Kirby plan to forgo 100% of their base salaries at least through June 30. To my knowledge, no such salary adjustments have been announced on the part of aircraft and parts-manufacturing companies.(Updates with information from United Airlines in the second and fifth paragraphs.)To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-03-03	2020-03-03 21:06:23	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Europeâs Corporate Debt Market Returns After Virus Halted Sales	(Bloomberg) -- Sherwin-Williams Co. and six other companies reopened the U.S. corporate bond markets after a week-long hiatus, following a handful of deals earlier Tuesday in Europe.The offerings mark the return of borrowers to primary debt markets after concerns about the spread of the coronavirus had virtually frozen issuance across the regions. Sherwin-Williamsâs deal was the first U.S. sale since Feb. 21, when maintenance supply distributor W.W. Grainger Inc. sold $500 million of five-year notes. New high-grade debt has also suffered in secondary market trading since then.âEven in the worst of times, there will always be demand for good names,â said John Sheehan, a portfolio manager at Osterweis Capital Management. âAs bad as things feel in the marketplace, if you put a concession on names people are comfortable with, youâll get new issues done.âMost deals in the U.S. had already been announced by 9:30 a.m. in New York, before the Federal Reserve said it was cutting interest rates by 50 basis points to protect the economy from the spreading virus. While Chairman Jerome Powell didnât cite any financial stability concerns, he did say the Fed would have bank supervisors advise banks to work with borrowers as appropriate if they face stresses.McDonaldâs DealSherwin-Williams and six others including McDonaldâs Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc. sold debt in the U.S., a swatch of fairly high-quality borrowers the market is already familiar with. The paint manufacturer issued $1 billion of senior unsecured notes in two parts. The longest portion of the offering, a 30-year security, yields 1.7 percentage points above Treasuries, after initially discussing around 1.95 percentage points, said a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.Companies sold $5.9 billion of U.S. investment grade bonds Tuesday, with most rushing to get deals done as rates volatility picked up after the Fed announcement. Some of todayâs deals, such as the McDonaldâs $2 billion debt offering, are already trading wider in the grey market, according to traders.In Europe, Honeywell International Inc. and publisher RELX Plc both offered multi-tranche euro-denominated deals, the first company bond sales since Feb. 25. Marketwide issuance will reach at least 5.79 billion euros ($6.43 billion) on Tuesday, with German lender Commerzbank AG also among the borrowers offering notes.Borrowers will likely have to accept that the funding environment wonât resemble what it was just a few weeks ago. Spreads have blown out, rates have rallied to historic lows and global markets remain riddled with uncertainty. This all suggests that issuers may have to sweeten deals in the form of elevated new issue concessions. And should deals go well, it could bode for more issuance in the rest of the week, said Erin Lyons, U.S. credit strategist at CreditSights.Disciplined InvestorsStill, investors will be disciplined in what they buy in the new issue market, said Tony Trzcinka, a portfolio manager at Impax Asset Management.âWe are definitely choosing our spots,â Trzcinka said. âI donât see a need to rush to add corporate exposure.âThe deals in Europe are low risk. Two deals are from German provinces while Commerzbankâs bonds are eligible for the European Central Bankâs asset purchase program. High quality names and ultra-safe securities offer a âsweet spot to confirm investorsâ willingness to engage,â in the market, said Matteo Benedetto, an executive director at Morgan Stanley & Co.Debt sales across Europe and the U.S. ground to a halt last week as the coronavirus spread across the world worsened, with the number of confirmed global cases now topping 90,000. Pledges of central bank support are boosting financial markets, with a gauge of default risk for European companies headed for its first day of tightening spreads -- indicating that sentiment has improved -- since Feb. 19.Charlotte, North Carolina-based Honeywell came through with a 1 billion-euro sale, three weeks after first hiring banks for the deal. It offered notes split between maturities of four and 12 years, with the longer tranche to price at 90 basis points above midswaps, down from around 115 points earlier, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified citing company policy.RELX raised 2 billion euros, spread across notes maturing in four, eight and 12 years. The order book for the deal had grown to more than 11 billion euros, people familiar with the demand said. German states Lower Saxony and Hesse were also among Tuesdayâs borrowers.Quick reactions âwill be one of the keys to successâ for borrowers venturing back into Europeâs primary bond market amid coronavirus-fueled volatility, said Gabriel Levy, global head of debt capital markets for financial institutions at Natixis SA.âThe coronavirus has shown that issuers were right to move quickly earlier this year,â Levy said.&#92;--With assistance from Michael Gambale, Brian Smith, Molly Smith, Caleb Mutua and Alice Gledhill.To contact the reporters on this story: Hannah Benjamin in London at hbenjamin1@bloomberg.net;Paul Cohen in London at pcohen10@bloomberg.net;Andrew Kostic in New York at akostic@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Vivianne Rodrigues at vrodrigues3@bloomberg.net, ;Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Chris Vellacott, Allan LopezFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-corporate-debt-market-returns-100808517.html?.tsrc=rss

Business jet deliveries are being underpinned by the ramp-up of new models by manufacturers Bombardier Inc and General Dynamics Corp unit Gulfstream Aerospace that offer longer ranges and amenities such as beds and hot showers at 40,000 feet.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/business-jet-deliveries-hit-decade-180000371.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-31	2020-01-31 14:56:08	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Markets Are Ignoring Manufacturers' GlumÂ Message	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The stock marketâs blind optimism is colliding with industrial CEOsâ realism.Â Caterpillar Inc. and Honeywell International Inc. rounded out a busy week of earnings for the manufacturing sector on Friday, with both companies pointing to a continuing slide in growth in 2020 that flies in the face of expectations for a swift rebound following the signing of the U.S.-China trade deal.âWe expect continued global uncertaintyâ in 2020, Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby said in a statement. That will push demand among end-users of its equipment down as much as 9% and encourage dealers to continue chipping away at existing inventory stockpiles rather than replenishÂ them. The company predicted a decline in residential and non-residential construction markets in North America and continuedÂ weakness in oil and gas, offset somewhat by a pickup in mining equipment, calls that have wide-reaching implications for much of the industrial sector. Sales in China may decline as much as 5%, Chief Financial OfficerÂ Andrew BonfieldÂ told Bloomberg News. Honeywellâs earnings guidance was in line with analystsâ estimates, but the range was fairly wide for the company, with a 40-cent swing between the best and worst case. Honeywell is âremaining cautiousâ on the macroeconomic outlook and the risks to its businesses that are among the first to reflect changesÂ in activity. ItÂ warned sales may be flat in 2020 after backing out the impact of M&A and currency swings.Honeywell has a history of being conservative, but youâve heard comments like this from a variety of industrial CEOs over the past few weeks, including CSX Corp.âs Jim Foote, W.W. Grainger Inc.âs DG Macpherson, DuPont de Nemours Inc.âs Marc Doyle and 3M Co.âs Mike Roman. Most are expecting the growth environment to remain lackluster â and for some markets, to get a bit worse â in the first half of the year before improving in the back end. But for many companies, that âimprovementâ has more to do with easier comparisons than any true demand spike. Weâve also seen this movie before, and forecastsÂ for a back-end-weighted recovery rarely play out as hoped.Â Heading into the year, CEOs listed the risk of a recession as their top concern for 2020, according to a global Conference Board survey. While the trade deal improved sentiment, corporate profits need to pick back up to drive increased spending, noteÂ Bloomberg Economists Andrew Husby and Yelena Shulyatyeva. There are a variety of complicating factors on the horizon, including the U.S. presidential election and potentially the ramifications of the burgeoning coronavirus epidemic. And donât forget,Â U.S. tariffs remain in place on some $360 billion of Chinese goods.For now, business investment remains muted, with orders for non-military equipment falling 0.9% in December, excluding aircraft, according to data from the Commerce Department released this week. Arguably, one benefit of elevated stock prices isÂ that buybacks are untenable and that may drive more CEOs to put their money to work on capital investments once the uncertainty clears. Honeywell plans to do both, buying back a minimum of 1% of its shares and spending as much much as $150 million on capital expenditures in 2020. But for industrial companies as a group, earnings gainsÂ appearÂ to rely more heavily on continued cost-cutting and productivity improvements rather than true fundamental growth.Caterpillar, which is currently predicting a second straight year-over-year decline in profit, said Friday it has a $200 million placeholder for strategic restructuring and is âprepared to respond quickly to any positive or negative changes in customer demand.â There has also been a troubling increase in below-the-line benefits and earnings adjustments, even at the typically clean Honeywell. Below-the-line items are expected to be as much as a $250 million benefit in 2020, compared with a $57 million drag in 2019, the company said. This impacts perceived quality, notes Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch.And yet investors seem only mildly concerned.Â  After initially sliding as much as 3.2%, Caterpillar shares were at times little changed and were down only about 1.5% as of mid-morning. Expectations were higher at Honeywell and that stock was down about 2%, but itâs still within spitting distance of an all-time high hit earlier this month. Investors may have the luxury of being more optimistic than CEOs, but Iâd listen to the guys who haveÂ to make the actual decisions when it comes to hiring and spending. And those guys (yes, theyâre all men) are still waving the yellow flag of caution.Â Â To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-01-29	2020-01-29 17:31:10	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	GE Bulls Finally Have More Than Hope on Their Side	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- General Electric Co.âs sharesÂ haveÂ traded more on hopeÂ than hard mathÂ over the past year, but it looks like CEO Larry Culpâs turnaround efforts areÂ starting to yield real results.Free cash flow is the key number to watch when the company reports earnings, and GE said Wednesday that it generated $2.3 billion from its industrial businesses over the course of 2019. That exceeded the high end of GEâs guidance range, which was updated twice over the course of the year from an initial call in March for free cash flow to be at best zero. Was Culp sandbagging expectations, or setting a low bar to start with and artfully managing to a positive surprise?Â (1) Itâs a fine line, but either way, the strategy worked. GE shares climbed more than 50% in 2019 and shareholders were still wowed enough by Wednesdayâs results to send the stock up an additional 10%.A lot of that optimism has to do with GEâs forecast for 2020.Â  The company is projecting free cash flow will at least roughly match 2019âs performance and potentially rise to as high as $4 billion. That would still fall below what GE generated in 2018Â amid depressed results, but would represent significant progressÂ nonetheless, and exceeds most analystsâ estimates. The company plans to hold a meeting with investors this coming March to lay out its outlook in more detail. On the earnings call, however, Culp let a few details slip.The beleaguered power and renewables units will likely continue to burn cash in 2020, with power improving from the negative $1.5 billion in cash flow in 2019 and renewables seeing a deterioration from the negative $1 billion the unit saw last year. Aviation will be flat to up from the $4.4 billion level of 2019, with the return of Boeing Co.âs 737 Max the biggest source of variability. That leaves health care as the one question mark. We already know the unit will be losing cash flow from the biopharma business thatâs being sold to Danaher Corp. Without biopharma, the health-care division would have generated about $1.2 billion in cash flow in 2019 and GE had previously guided for an increaseÂ in 2020. Taking all of that together, GE should be able to fall well within its guidance range, but theÂ potential to rack up a similar string of outsize positive surprises is arguably more limited this year.Boeingâs Max is the biggest source of volatility for GEâs guidance, Culp said on the earnings call, and the company is currently modeling for a mid-2020 return of the jet, in line with Boeingâs most recent âbest estimate.â Boeing also reported earnings today and, based on that timeline, announced a fresh $5.2 billion in charges tied to compensation for airlines and additionalÂ production costs. The company also said it anticipates $4 billion in âabnormal costsâ for restarting production of the jet. That brings the total bill for the Max crisis to more than $18 billion, before accounting for any fines or legal penalties from numerous lawsuits and government investigations.GE makes the engines for the Max through its CFM International joint venture with Safran SA and expects to see its shipment rate cut in half in 2020 amid the production halt. Asked about the $1.4 billion drag on free cash flow from the Max grounding in 2019, outgoing Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller implied free cash flow would have been that much higher without that impact. In that case, arguably 2020 results could also be higher, but there are a lot of moving pieces here and it feels like GE is being more prudent than deliberately conservative.The shift from optics to fundamentals is a welcome one. Culpâs task now is to keep the momentum going. In contrast to this time last year âÂ when expectations could hardly have been much lower for GE â thereâs now a fair amount of optimism reflectedÂ in the shares. After the stock pop on Wednesday, the company is currently valued at about 28 times its expected 2020 industrial free cash flow of at most $4 billion. That compares with about 20 times at Honeywell International Inc. and about 18Â times for Emerson Electric Co. Put another way, much of GEâs anticipated progress in this multi-year turnaround is already priced in to the stock. But so far, Culp hasÂ provedÂ the skeptics wrong and the optimists justified. So maybe thereâs more room yet for hope.(1) To put that in perspective, consider that about a month before GE gave its initial comments on 2019, uber-bear JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Steve Tusa was forecasting $2.5 billion in industrial free cash flow for 2019 -- meaning the actual results are actually weaker than what even he had expected heading into the year.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-01-21	2020-01-21 19:33:50	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Why Next Weekâs Earnings Are Huge for General Electric	Investors are starting to believe in General Electric (NYSE:GE) again. GE stock has rallied some 54% from August lows. And there's a case that the rally can continue.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com After all, the bull case for General Electric stock rests on a turnaround engineered by chief executive officer Larry Culp. Culp transformed Danaher (NYSE:DHR) into a technology powerhouse; Danaher stock rose some 530% during his 14-year tenure.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 Culp's appointment as General Electric's CEO on Oct. 1, 2018 was greeted with hopes that Culp could work similar magic: GE stock rose 7.1% on the news. But that enthusiasm has dimmed over time. Even with the rally over the past five months, General Electric shares are up less than 2% in the fifteen-plus months since Culp's hiring was announced.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe lack of upside so far suggests that more upside could be on the way if General Electric can drive the hoped-for turnaround. That's still a huge 'if,' however. Fourth quarter earnings on Jan. 29 will be huge in establishing how much progress GE is making -- and how much confidence investors can have in its future. Why Q4 Earnings Won't Change the CaseThe fourth quarter numbers themselves may not be all that important. Analyst estimates are soft, with the Street looking for earnings per share to climb a penny year-over-year on revenue down 23.5%.The top line pressure isn't necessarily the sign of a declining business. GE Aviation likely will see short-term pressure from the 737 MAX issues at key customer Boeing (NYSE:BA). And a reduction in the company's stake in Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR) means that business no longer will be part of GE's consolidated financials.Q4 almost certainly isn't going to be impressive. Of course, that won't surprise anyone who's been paying attention. These two short-term factors will hit the reported numbers. And from a long-term standpoint, even Culp himself has emphasized more than once that the turnaround here will take time.The one number that will be closely watched is free cash flow. General Electric already has raised its outlook twice this year, and needs to hit its target. The gap between earnings and cash flow long has been a problem for GE stock. It was a key part of the (admittedly questionable) short seller report that sent shares tumbling briefly last year. And disappointing cash flow generation contributed to the two dividend cuts seen in recent years.Reaching the current forecast of roughly $2 billion in industrial cash flow (which excludes contributions from GE Capital) would be a step toward restoring GE's credibility. That aside, Q4 numbers, barring a huge surprise, seem highly unlikely to change sentiment toward General Electric.But that doesn't mean the fourth quarter release doesn't matter. It does. Why the Q4 Earnings Release Might Change the CaseThe focus won't be on the backward-looking numbers for a quarter affected by external factors. It's going to be on 2020 guidance.Again, General Electric has a long road ahead. Success is not guaranteed. As Dirk Hackbarth, Professor of Finance at the Boston University Questrom School of Business, told InvestorPlace:&quot;Given its rebound, GE's future seems to be less of a &quot;continued turnaround&quot; and more one of a &quot;strategic disinvestment&quot; of its non-core pieces for the best prices it can getâ¦Moreover, the proceeds from asset sales and spin-offs should be used to gradually de-lever GE to a level that is more in line with its profitability (e.g. return on assets) going forward.&quot;The bull case is that this will become a &quot;leaner and meaner&quot; General Electric. And so it would do wonders for GE stock if the company can show some progress this year. Right now, analysts aren't sure it will. Wall Street estimates for 2020 earnings per share currently have a wide range: the low estimate, according to Yahoo! Finance, is 49 cents, while the most bullish projection sits at 77 cents.That range isn't surprising given that analyst price targets too have a large split, as Hackbarth pointed out and Barron's noted last year. At the moment, the most bearish analyst (which I believe is Morgan Stanley's Stephen Tusa, long a GE skeptic) values GE stock at $5. The high target is $14.In that context, the 2020 outlook becomes exceedingly important. Full-year 2019 adjusted EPS should come in around 61 cents. If GE guides toward the low end of Street estimates, GE stock quickly looks overvalued. Investors are paying something close to 20x earnings -- and a higher multiple to free cash flow -- for a business still in decline.If GE supports more bullish expectations, however, this story gets much more interesting in a hurry. Guidance for, say, 70 cents would imply double-digit profit growth in 2020. Yet GE stock would be trading at roughly 17x that guidance. Rival Honeywell (NYSE:HON) trades at 21x 2020 consensus earnings with single-digit growth expected. A Big Stretch for GE StockAgain, next week's release won't prove that GE is destined for a turnaround -- or that it's doomed to further declines. But 2020 guidance, in particular, well may establish the direction of General Electric stock for several months, if not the rest of this year.It could go either way. GE stock could look very different depending on the trajectory established by 2020 results. Hackbarth forecast that the stock &quot;more likely stabilizes in the current price range&quot; this year. If 2020 performance in line with current expectations, that forecast is probably correct.But if GE can surprise to the upside, the story improves. GE has &quot;many attractive parts,&quot; as Hackbarth put it. Aviation should benefit from long-term air travel demand. Healthcare has real potential, as I detailed last month. GE Power has substantial room for improvement. Those three units underpin the bull case here.That bull case, however, exists mostly on paper for now. It's up to Culp and GE to turn that theoretical potential into practical returns and cash flow. A confident outlook for 2020 can drive more confidence on that front, and thus more confidence in GE stock.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2020-01-16	2020-01-16 16:51:35	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Breakup Is Another Word for Lack of New Ideas	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Thereâs no clearer sign weâve reached peak breakup in industrials than a pure-play transportation and logistics company blaming aÂ âconglomerate discountâ for its decision to consider cleavingÂ itself into smallerÂ pieces.XPO Logistics Inc. confirmed late Wednesday that it was exploring strategic alternatives including the possible sale or spinoff of one or more of its units. The review could see businesses that generate as much as 75% of XPOâs revenue jettisoned, with the European, North American and Asia-Pacific supply-chain operations and its European and North American transportation arms all potentially on the block, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. That would leave XPO with its North American short-haul trucking business. XPO CEO Brad Jacobs told Bloomberg TV heâs exploring breakup options because the company is suffering from a âconglomerate discountâ and âWall Street understands pure plays.âThose are in-vogue words right now for industrial CEOs after an unprecedented wave of breakups. But the majority of those splits involved businesses that had little or only tenuous connections to each other â think the separation of Ingersoll-Rand Plcâs golf cart, tools and pumps business from its HVAC division, or United Technologies Corp.âs breakup of its aviation, climate and elevator businesses. Even controversial breakups such as Honeywell International Inc.âs spinoff of its Resideo Technologies Inc. thermostat and Garrett Motion Inc. turbochargers businesses, or Fortive Corp.âs plan to carve out its legacy industrial products, involved divisions that clearly didnât fit. XPO is splitting the hairs much more finely. According to its most recent annual filing, the company gets 65% of its revenue from transportation and 35% from logistics.All the same, the market clearly does love this move. The stock climbed more than 10%Â on the news, with some of that likely reflecting a squeeze on short sellers who have a 13.1% interest in shares outstanding, according to Markit. Citigroup Inc. analyst Christian Wetherbee estimated a breakup could add as much as $66 a share to XPOâs equity value. And thatâs likely appealing for investors looking for a story to bet on amid generally elevated valuations elsewhere in industrial stocks.Â But itâs hard not to view this breakup plan as a waving of the white flag for a company that was built via consolidation but has struggled of late to get deals done. XPO hasnât announced a major acquisition since 2015, despite Jacobsâs exclamation in 2017 that he was ready to spend up to $8 billion. Last year, XPO said it would pivot away from M&A and plow billions into share buybacks instead. That helped drive XPO shares to a 40% gain in 2019, despite a recession in freight markets.With its debt levels rising and little in the way of real earnings growth, keeping the party going presented a challenge. Jacobs laid out a plan in August to add as much as $1 billion of profit by 2022 via cost cuts and new business. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lee Klaskow, who noted at the time that such a push carried significant execution risk, says the breakup may be a sign that XPO had already squeezed all it could from the business as far as operating improvements and technology investments.The point of all of XPOâs M&A activity was to wring costs out of the combined operations and gain more negotiating clout with suppliers. Jacobs told Bloomberg TV that XPOâs combination of businesses had helped it add more than $2 billion of revenue organically. âWe actually will lose some bargaining power as smaller companies with vendors because we wonât have the global procurement capability,â Jacobs said. But he thinks smaller, more agile businesses will be more appealing to both customers and shareholders.When a CEO is talking out of two sides of his mouth, it sure sounds like financial engineering.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-12-20	2019-12-20 09:31:02	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Progress on One Key Metric Should Power a 21% GE Stock Rally to $14	Around this time last year, there were serious concerns about General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock. Shares were flirting with a single-digit stock-price breakdown, as GE stock eventually bottomed just above $6. Then-new CEO Larry Culp didn't get much of a honeymoon.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Since then, shares have almost doubled to current prices, near $11 per share. While the fundamentals are still a bit sketchy, it's got many investors wondering if the worst is now behind General Electric stock. A Clash of AnalystsWhile they're not rivaling with each other, two analysts have very different views on GE stock. First, there's JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa. He was the first analyst to turn bearish on General Electric and was consistently ahead of each decline in the stock price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIronically, he upgraded the stock from sell to neutral in December 2018, which kickstarted the stock's massive rally off the lows. After earnings and investor day presentations though, Tusa later downgraded GE back down to a sell rating in 2019. He also maintains a $5 price target and is still not bullish.On the flip side, there's UBS, which recently upgraded the stock from neutral to buy and raised its price target from $11.50 to a Street-high $14.A new UBS analyst, Markus Mittermaier, took over coverage of GE and proceeded to give the industrial giant a buy rating last week in his first note to clients.GE stock is at a &quot;positive inflection point,&quot; he wrote, arguing that strong earnings growth estimates for 2020 and 2021, robust free cash flow growth and de-levering its balance sheet should all contribute to a higher stock price.  * 7 'Strong Buy' Stocks to Put on Your Wish List I won't pretend to know more than these two in regards to GE stock. General Electric clearly has some issues to work through yet. It's really a question of whether management can execute the current turnaround plan, whether investors believe in that plan and if the stock market can hold up.Let's look at the charts to see what the technicals say. Trading GE StockShares of GE were trying to breakout over the $10.50 to $10.75 area for much of 2019. Ultimately, the stock did breakout over this level in November, but not before suffering a major breakdown first.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comGE stock price was again rejected from resistance in August. In a matter of days, the stock broke below all of its major moving averages, as well as uptrend support (blue line). Eventually, shares bottomed at $7.64 in mid-August -- quite the two-week decline, I might add -- and began to put in a series of higher lows from that point.Since breaking out though, the stock is trading much better on the long side. General Electric stock does have a short-term downtrend line weighing on it, while $11.50 has been acting as resistance.On the plus side, the $10.50 the $10.75 area that was previous resistance is now acting as support. For now, active bulls can look for support in this area while looking to sell near $11.50. On a break below support, see if either the 50-day or the 200-day moving averages act as support.It's totally possible that UBS' $14 price target is achieved even if support fails. But it will be much easier on the bulls if support holds and the stock takes out $11.50 resistance, rallying to $12-plus going into or in early 2020. Bottom Line on General Electric StockCould 2019 be the bottoming year for General Electric stock? Analysts expect earnings to fall 6.2% this year and sales to decline 22.8%. However, 2020 forecasts call for earnings to grow almost 10% despite a slight decline in revenue.  * 5 Large-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy The real kicker here is free cash flow. If the company can show a notable improvement in this metric, investors -- and perhaps more importantly, Tusa -- will turn more bullish.That said, GE is very much a &quot;prove it&quot; story at this point. After seeing a 78% haircut in just 30 months and axing its dividend down to nothing, this old conglomerate has to prove its worth. Particularly as Boeing (NYSE:BA) continues to struggle -- one of GE Aviation's customers -- and as competitors like Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) continue to march higher and higher.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Tops for 2020: The 5 Best Industrial Stocks to Buy	While frequently overlooked, industrial stocks held their own throughout 2019 and appear to be in strong position heading into 2020.The ongoing U.S.-Chinese trade war hasn't exactly been easy for American industrial companies, which on average derive more than a third of their revenues from China, and many of which order supplies from the country as well. Nonetheless, the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) actually boasted slightly better returns than the S&P; 500 year-to-date through Dec. 3. The sector is set up to beat the Street next year, too.Barry Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel Nicolaus, suggesting that investors buy into cyclical stocks such as industrials while shedding defensive plays. &quot;Although we see (more than) 5% further for the S&P; 500 into 2020, we see twice that return, or plus 10%, for a long-cyclical/short defensive industry trade in the same period,&quot; he writes.Given that industrial stocks still face trade risks, however, investors are (rightfully) seeking out the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me - those stocks poised to continue outperforming through 2020 and beyond. One way to separate the wheat from the chaff is to focus on the names Wall Street analysts are standing firmly behind.Here are the five best industrial stocks to buy for 2020. We've used TipRanks' Stock Screener to zero in on five industrial-sector companies that are receiving robust support from the Street, earning a &quot;Strong Buy&quot; consensus rating.

2019-12-03	2019-12-03 10:39:54	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	How Blacklisting Companies Became a Trade War Weapon	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.Â Sign up here.Â Tariffs arenât the only weapon in a trade war. Countries are also turning to âblacklistsâ to restrict the economic activities of certain foreign companies. While such steps are often described as necessary to preserve national security, theyâre increasingly being deployed as policy tools to gain leverage in trade negotiations. In the case of the U.S. and China, disputes over human rights or geopolitics also can play a role.1&#92;. Where is this happening?President Donald Trump has placed dozens of Chinese companies on the U.S. Commerce Departmentâs âentity listâ -- a classification that restricts their ability to purchase U.S. software and components. Chinaâs government has been considering hitting back with a blacklist of its own, targeting foreign companies, organizations and people it calls âunreliable entities.â Export powerhouses Japan and South Korea also have deployed trade restrictions in a renewal of a long feud dating back to Japanâs colonization of the Korean peninsula in the early 20th century.2&#92;. Who is on the U.S. list?The most prominent among those blacklisted in May, primarily on national security grounds, is Huawei Technologies Co., the telecommunications giant at the forefront of fifth-generation, or 5G, mobile technology. In October, the U.S. added 28 Chinese companies -- including another eight technology giants -- for alleged human rights violations against Uighur Muslims in Chinaâs far west Xinjiang province. Those companies include two of the worldâs largest manufacturers of video surveillance products, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co., and a pair of artificial-intelligence companies, SenseTime Group Ltd. and Megvii Technology Ltd.3&#92;. How is China responding?Slowly. In May, it said it was compiling its own list of âunreliable entities,â defined as those having âseverely damaged the legitimate interestsâ of Chinese firms by not obeying market rules, violating contracts or blocking or cutting off supply for noncommercial reasons. None were identified but FedEx Corp. has been under particular scrutiny after China accused it of mis-routing some parcels sent by Huawei. In July, Chinese state media raised the specter of backlash against U.S. companies including General Dynamics Corp. and Honeywell International Inc. in connection with a proposed $2 billion U.S. arms sale to Taiwan. A month later, China vowed retaliation against U.S. companies participating in a proposed $8 billion U.S. sale of Lockheed Martin Corp. F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan. It also has pledged to retaliate against Trumpâs sanctions related to human rights violations.4&#92;. When will that happen?Soon, the Communist Party-backed Global Times said in early December. It reported said the list was being sped up in response to a bill moving through the U.S. Congress requiring measures against Chinese officials involved in alleged abuses of Uighurs. The bill passed the Senate in September and the House was set to vote on it in December. However, Chinese officials have said âsoonâ before.5&#92;. What does it mean to be blacklisted by the U.S.?Those on the U.S. entity list are prohibited from doing business with American companies without first obtaining a U.S. government license. It was created in 1997 as a way to sanction companies that helped build weapons of mass destruction. Itâs since been expanded to cover activities considered âcontrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.â Targets can be âbusinesses, research institutions, government and private organizations, individuals, and other types of legal persons,â according to the Commerce Departmentâs Bureau of Industry and Security, which administers the list as part of U.S. Export Administration Regulations.6&#92;. What about by China?Unclear. âNecessary measures will be takenâ against those listed, was all Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said when he announced it May 31. However, the broad definition opens the possibility that a great swath of the global technology industry could be targeted, including U.S. giants such as Google, Qualcomm and Intel, as well as non-American suppliers that have cut off Huawei like Toshiba Corp. and SoftBank Group Corp.âs ARM Holdings. Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin said on his Twitter feed that U.S. officials and diplomats might face visa and travel restrictions.7&#92;. What explains the increased use of blacklists?Itâs part of what trade hawks in both governments see as a generational fight for technological and economic supremacy of the 21st century. The Chinese government has leveraged its massive state resources to support industrial policies like âMade in China 2025,â and a 2017 development strategy that aims to make China the worldâs primary artificial intelligence innovation center by 2030. The Trump administration, backed by many in Congress, views this as a threat to Americaâs economic and national security and has actively sought to curb Chinaâs technological ambitions.To contact the reporters on this story: Bryce Baschuk in Geneva at bbaschuk2@bloomberg.net;Brendan Murray in London at brmurray@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Murray at brmurray@bloomberg.net, Laurence Arnold, Grant ClarkFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blacklisting-companies-became-trade-war-103954876.html?.tsrc=rss

It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]When the stock market marches higher, it pushes the prices of many companies higher along with it. But as investors bid up good and bad businesses alike, that can make it hard to discern which companies are the best dividend stocks for long-term investors.In this income-centric world, income-starved investors face great temptation to reach for high-dividend stocks that offer juicy yields. Fortunately, Simply Safe Dividends identified the nine best dividend growth stocks that investors can rely on for secure, fast-growing income.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese companies all have very healthy Dividend Safety Scores, which measure a firm's most important financial metrics to gauge how likely it is to cut its dividend in the future.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 Let's take a look at nine of the safest dividend stocks in the market. These dividend-paying companies generate excellent free cash flow, maintain safe payout ratios, are committed to rewarding shareholders with healthy dividend increases and have bright long-term outlooks. Lowe's Companies (LOW)Dividend Yield: 2%  Year-to-Date Gain: 18.7%Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) is the world's second-largest home improvement retailer.With more than 65 years of operations, this dividend stock has gained recognition as one of the trusted national brands. Over the years, Lowe's has developed an extensive line of thousands of products for maintenance, repair, remodeling and decorating across lumber and building materials, tools and hardware, lawn and garden, paint, kitchens, outdoor power equipment and home fashion categories.The company serves a wide spectrum of &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; and &quot;do-it-for-me&quot; customers, including homeowners, renters and professional contractors from different construction trades.A large footprint of conveniently located stores across the U.S., an extensive range of products, a well-known brand and a diversified customer base are Lowe's key competitive advantages.The home improvement industry is also poised to grow as consumer confidence remains high, employment continues rising and home prices climb higher. This should lead to better growth prospects for the company and its dividend.Lowe's has an impeccable record of not only paying but also increasing its dividend since 1961, growing it by over 20% annually in the last five years. Lowe's price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.6 seems reasonable for a company of this quality. Honeywell International (HON)Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2%  YTD Gain:  38%Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) is a diversified global technology and manufacturing company supplying industrial products, software and services to a diversified set of customers.  Honeywell operates through four segments: aerospace; home and building technologies; performance materials and technologies and safety and productivity solutions.The company serves customers through a wide variety of products and services in aerospace, control, sensing and security.

With a broad portfolio of physical products and software, the company has uniquely positioned itself to sell comprehensive solutions for homes and businesses across many industries.A broad portfolio of technology, extensive products and services, a global distribution network, and a presence in growing areas like the Internet of Things and energy efficiency are Honeywell's key strengths.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 A track record of strong financial performance and a healthy payout ratio have enabled the company to grow its dividend by 13% per year over the last five years. Honeywell has paid uninterrupted dividends for more than two decades. Apple (AAPL)Source: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.17%  YTD Gain: 67%Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the world's most valuable companies and one of the largest positions in Warren Buffett's dividend stock portfolio.Apple is the world's second-largest smartphone company, accounting for more than 10% of the global market share. The iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV are Apple's key products, with the iPhone representing over the majority of its 2018 sales. These products are globally recognized for their high quality, premium brand and ease-of-use, allowing Apple to enjoy substantial pricing power.In addition, the company also owns a portfolio of consumer and professional software such as iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems that act as key differentiators. Apple's products and solutions are known for their innovative design, user-friendly experience and seamless integration.All these innovative products have established Apple's supremacy in the mobile space, and the company invests around 5% of its revenues on R&D activities to stay ahead of competitors.Moreover, only Apple devices run iOS, which means that if customers want to remain within the Apple ecosystem, they must continue buying iOS devices. This results in sticky customer relationships. Its sales of games, music and other digital content through the iTunes store is another high-margin cash flow stream that keeps growing every year.A leading brand name, global geographical presence, impressive product portfolio and super-sticky customer relationships have helped form a huge moat around Apple's business.Apple started paying dividends again in 2012 and it has seen its payout grow by approximately 11% annually over the last three years.Given Apple's leading market share, loyal customers, innovative products and hoard of cash on the balance sheet, the company should continue raising its dividend at a strong pace in the future as well. Medtronic (MDT)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.00%  YTD Gain: 20%Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a leading medical technology, services and solutions company serving hospitals, physicians, clinicians and patients worldwide.

It develops analog integrated circuits and embedded processors that are subsequently sold to electronics manufacturers.The company's product portfolio consists of tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices and managing and distributing power.Texas Instruments' focus on these segments provides a combination of stability and strong cash generation, owing to the products' long product life cycles and low capital-intensive manufacturing.Leading industry products, a diverse portfolio, unique technologies and manufacturing scale and a strong reputation enable Texas Instruments to generate stable and recurring cash flows.As a result, Texas Instruments has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1962 and it has recorded an impressive annual dividend growth rate of approximately 34.2% over the last three years.Last year marked the company's 14th consecutive year of dividend increases, wherein Texas Instruments raised its dividend by nearly 25%.Given its predictable cash flow generation, impressive dividend track record and reasonable payout ratio,, the company should be able to continue rewarding shareholders with double-digit dividend growth in the years ahead. Costco Wholesale (COST)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 0.9%  YTD Gain: 49%Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is a membership warehouse club with more than 500 U.S. store locations that provide merchandise at low prices to its members.

Costco's membership base is growing with a renewal rate of over 90% as of its December 2018 quarter.Over its 35 years of existence, Costco has succeeded in providing a great customer experience by blending together the convenience of specialty departments and a selection of wide merchandise at affordable prices. It has become a trusted name owing to its low cost and quality merchandise.The company buys directly from many producers of national brand-name merchandise and sends products directly to its warehouses, eliminating multi-step distribution costs. High sales volumes, rapid inventory turnover, efficient distribution and self-service warehouse facilities also ensure high operational efficiency.  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 A large and loyal customer base, economies of scale, a diverse mix of merchandise, and strategically-located warehouses are Costco's major competitive advantages.Analysts expect Costco's sales growth to sit in the mid-single-digits range over the long-term, which could result in 8%-9% annual earnings growth in the coming years. Costco could, therefore, continue its solid pace of dividend growth.

Its top tenants include well-known names like AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S).The real estate investment trust derives most of its revenue from tenant leases, which typically have an initial non-cancellable term of ten years with multiple renewal terms, as well as provisions for annual price increases. It is difficult for tenants to find suitable alternative sites and as such the lease renewal rates are generally high.Moreover, the incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively low and annual capital expenditures to maintain communications sites are also not high. All these factors provide high cash-flow visibility and excellent profitability for American Tower.American Tower should keep growing its earnings as demand for wireless services and data grows in the coming years. A global asset base, recession-proof demand for its sites, long-standing relationships with customers and low cash-flow volatility provide a moat around American Tower's business.Simply put, wireless tower companies possess many attractive qualities. That's probably why Crown Castle International (CCI), one of American Tower's peers, is a position in Bill Gates' dividend stock portfolio.Given American Tower's history of double-digit growth in property revenue and the near-tripling of its dividend in just the past five years, shareholders can likely expect at least 20% annual dividend growth in the years ahead.

2019-10-22	2019-10-22 13:00:24	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	AMLOâs âHugs Not BulletsâÂ Is Failing Mexico	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last week, the streets of Culiacan, the capital of Mexicoâs Sinaloa state, became a battlefield, with the Sinaloa cartel directly confronting the government and winning. The week before, 13 police officers were killed in an ambush in Michoacan, likely by the Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel. Overall, murders and kidnappings are at record levels and spreading through Mexicoâs once-safer industrial heartland and capital city.Talk of Mexico becoming a failed state is again on the rise. Two decades ago, the last time experts were so worried, the U.S. and Mexico formed a historic security partnership. Thatâs unlikely to happen again. Both nations will suffer as a result.Rising violence helped propel President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, popularly known as AMLO, into office, with Mexicansâ desperation for basic safety a key driver of the vote for change. He promised a seismic shift, ending the war on drugs with âhugs not bullets.â A new 60,000-strong National Guard would replace a tainted federal police. And the militarized enforcement would give way to new scholarships, stipends, and drug treatment.Yet nearly a year on, security hasÂ deteriorated. Drug-funded cartels arenât the only threat. Dozens of criminal groups profit from human trafficking, extortion, kidnapping, and protection rackets (avocados a lucrative favorite).Things wonât improve anytime soon. AMLOâs social approach to preventing violence will take years to translate into real change on the ground, if it ever works. His new National Guard will also take time to hire, train and cohere in the best of circumstances. Todayâs circumstances are far from that: The first round of recruits, mostly recycled from the military and federal police, have been sent to round up Central American migrants rather than fight criminals. Even the most promising of security policies canât get far without money, and AMLO hasnât raised security spending from less than 1% of gross domestic product.The last time Mexico faced such peril, it turned to the United States. The U.S. government responded, recognizing its role in the drug trade and stake in a secure Mexico. In 2007 presidents Felipe Calderon and George W. Bush hashed out a historic security agreement that came to be known as the Merida Initiative. Over the course of the next decade the U.S. would spend more than $1.6 billion, and Mexico billions more, to dismantle criminal organizations, strengthen Mexicoâs rule of law, modernize the border, and help violence-ridden communities. As important as money, Merida overcame a historically fraught bilateral security relationship, building trust and cooperation.The prolonged gunfight that set Culiacan ablaze came from a botched attempt to fulfill a long-standing U.S. request to extradite one of the sons of Chapo Guzman, former head of the Sinaloa cartel. In the aftermath, AMLO and President Donald Trump talked and reaffirmed the âsolidarityâ between the two nations. But thatÂ doesnât mean a revival of close cooperation. AMLOâs nationalistic political base remains deeply suspicious of all U.S. motives; he isnât likely to ask for help, even if he needs it. AMLO has bashed the Merida initiative for its military ways â though in truth the partnership turned away long ago from providing helicopters and hardware to training police officers and supporting justice reforms.Even if the Mexican president did turn to the U.S. for help, few on the U.S. side are there to heed the call. Trumpâs last confirmed Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere exited the building in August after only 10 months in office. The Department of Homeland Security is losing its third secretary in just six months (many deputy posts also remain empty or filled by acting officials). Moreover, the departmentâs resources have moved away from drugs and border security to migrants.The U.S. isnât immune to stepped-up violence in Mexico. Its economic costs hit U.S. factories, offices, and workers whose jobs depend on exports south (Mexico remains the second biggest U.S. customer in the world). Violence and crime can also slow or disrupt the flow of parts that help make the U.S. auto, aerospace, medical equipment, and other regional industries globally competitive. Dozens of U.S. companies, including General Motors Co., Honeywell International Inc., Nordam Group Inc., and Medtronic Plc, depend on the speedy delivery of Mexican-made components to keep their operations running in Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina and Oklahoma.The violence will also exacerbate and accelerate migration north. Mexican refugees donât need to travel thousands of miles to reach the U.S., nor can they be stopped by the National Guard. U.S. border personnel are already seeing a sharp uptick in Mexican asylum seekers.So what are the two nations to do? Stop worrying so much about sovereignty and focus on what will save lives. And that is taking on organized crime together. To do so means revisiting and doubling down on the four principles of the Merida Initiative: Strategically going after the bad guys, focusing border resources less on stopping fleeing families than on curbing the flows of drugs, guns, and illicit money, and especially strengthening the rule of law and helping stricken communities.Mexico of course needs to step up and deal with its own problems (starting with a huge bump in security spending). But cross-border causes of violence demand cross-border solutions. The two governments need once again to expand the cooperative (versus coercive) parts of the bilateral agenda beyond just passing the USMCA trade agreement. Both presidents must recognize that security at home depends on making all of North America safer.To contact the author of this story: Shannon O'Neil at soneil@cfr.orgTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Gibney at jgibney5@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shannon O'Neil is a senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinionÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amlo-hugs-not-bullets-failing-130024121.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-17	2019-10-17 20:03:56	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	5 Top Stock Trades for Friday: MS, FB, HON, GOGO, UNP	A reported Brexit deal sent stocks higher in morning trade, although equities had trouble maintaining those gains throughout the session. Let's look at a few top stock trades for Friday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Morgan Stanley (MS) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) popped on earnings but is struggling to hold onto its early gains. Now over all of its major moving averages, MS stock looks better than it has all month.However, it still remains range-bound between $39.50 and $45.50. Until it can push through resistance, it may remain stuck in this range.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Facebook (FB)Despite a continual flow of negative news and headlines, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock continues to hold up.  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever It's above all of its major moving averages, as well as downtrend resistance (blue line). Now running into its 78.6% retracement and a recent level of resistance near $190, it will be vital for bulls to push it through this mark.If it can, look for a rally above last month's high at $193.10, and then above $195. In this event, look for $190 to act as support on a pullback. If resistance holds steady, look to see if the 50-day moving average can buoy FB on a pullback. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Honeywell (HON)Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is advancing on earnings, but is struggling to push through its downtrend (purple line) and the 100-day moving average. If it can do that, it puts the $172.50 mark on the table, with the $177.58 highs above that.On the downside, look to see if the 50-day moving average can act as support. Below it puts a test of the 200-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line) in the cards. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Gogo (GOGO)A look at Gogo's (NYSE:GOGO) daily chart above shows the company has secured a higher low, which is now connected by a blue trend line on the chart above. I want to see shares push through $6, putting $7-plus on the table.As you can also see, momentum is starting to turn in bulls' favor via the MACD reading (blue circle). If $6 acts as resistance, bulls need to see the 50-day act as support.On the weekly chart above, traders can see the stock coiling below $6 and the 100-week moving average. Above them opens the door to the recent high at $7.23. Above that and $8 is possible. On a longer timeframe, the 50-week moving average is a must-hold mark.Gogo has been an excellent trade for us lately, although it is a speculative play. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Union Pacific (UNP)Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is rallying on earnings, but it's running into some headwinds. Shares are being stymied by the 200-day and 100-day moving averages. It's also hitting channel resistance (blue line).However, not all hope is lost for the bulls. On the move, UNP reclaimed its 50-day moving average. It also held the 61.8% retracement. If shares can stay above these two marks, then bulls may look for it to push through resistance.Below the 61.8% and UNP starts to lose some of the little appeal that it has. A fall below this mark could usher in $157.50 or lower and even drop the stock into the low $150's.The charts are messy for this one. Over the 61.8% is good, but over the 100-day moving average is far better. Some may prefer to wait for a clean breakout over $170, putting $178-plus on the table.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-10-17	2019-10-17 13:52:44	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Factory Slump Is Flyover Country at Honeywell	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Honeywell International Inc.âs aerospace halo is worth its weight in jet fuel.The $120 billion conglomerateÂ reported its third-quarter results on Thursday, and while there was evidence of the slowdown gripping the rest of the manufacturing industry, there was also proof that everything thatâs made Honeywell an industrialÂ  darling of Wall Street this past year still holds true. On the one hand, Honeywell cut its 2019 sales outlook. Revenue at itsÂ safety and productivity unit slumped 8% in the third quarter,Â excluding the impact of currency swings and M&A, as inventory piled up and projects got pushed out. Offsetting that bleak result was Honeywellâs aerospace division, which delivered robust 10% organic revenue growth. And HoneywellÂ raised its 2019 earnings forecast.So in the end, what could have been an ugly earnings day for Honeywell ended up eliciting a polite clap. As trading beganÂ in New York, the stock was up about 1%.For Honeywell and other industrial companies, aerospace has been a rare bright spot at a time when many other sectors, particularly automotive, electronics and increasingly construction-related businesses, are slowing down. The decline appears to be accelerating: railroad Union Pacific Corp. on Thursday reported an 8% slump in carload volumes in the third quarter while construction-rental equipment company United Rentals Inc. trimmed its revenue guidance late Wednesday. Meanwhile, a report from the Federal Reserve on Thursday showed that U.S. factory output declined in September by the most in five months as a strike at General Motors Co., the trade war and generally sluggish demand weighed on production.The sustainability of the years-long aerospace boom has come into question as a wobbling Chinese economy and the prolonged trade war risk damping demand for travel. Global passenger traffic grew 3.8% in August, well off the pace of the past few years, according to the International Air Transport Association. But thatâs still growth, at least for now. Parts makers like Honeywell are also seeing more demand for services on older aircraft while the Boeing Co. 737 Max remains grounded.In its earnings presentation, Honeywell said it expects further growth in commercial flight hours and the rollout of new jet programs to continue to boost sales at the aerospace division in 2020. Margins may get squeezed,Â because the businessÂ will tilt more heavily toward the less profitable work of installing new equipment versus maintaining older versions.The generally upbeatÂ aerospace narrative contrasts with downbeat performances elsewhere at the company. The sales decline at the safety and productivity unit was the worst for the business since 2016, when the manufacturing sector was emerging from a mini-recession sparked by the plunge in oil prices. Margins in the safety and productivity business fell 320 basis points to 13.4%. Honeywell still recorded healthy growth in its chemicals and materials unit and building-technologies division, but the pace slackened from the second quarter. Honeywell now expects total company organic sales to grow at best 5% this year, down from an earlier projection of as much as 6%.Amid what it deemed an âuncertain macro environment,â Honeywell reiterated its ability to protect its earnings through a downturn by continuing to cut costs and using its ample balance sheet for M&A and share buybacks. CEO Darius Adamczyk has largely sat comfortably on the M&A sidelines the past few years, holding out for lower valuations that may now be coming. There had been some concern when he took over fromÂ former leader Dave Cote and talked passionately about accelerating Honeywellâs revenue growth that such an effort would come at the expense of the companyâs almost religious commitment to margin improvements. That concern was ill-founded. Honeywell boosted its margin guidance for the full year in part because of the benefits of previously funded restructuring, operating improvements and the spinoffs of the less profitable Garrett Motion Inc. turbocharger and Resideo Technologies Inc. consumer-facing home products businesses last year.Honeywell is making a good case for why itâs a decent place to hide in the event of aÂ manufacturingÂ slowdown, or perhaps broaderÂ recession. But the fact that itâs making thisÂ argumentÂ increasingly loudly should be a warning for the rest of the industrial sector.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-10-17	2019-10-17 10:00:00	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Builders DitchÂ Nest AfterÂ Google Ties Devices to Digital Assistant	(Bloomberg) -- Several residential builders have stopped buying and installing Googleâs Nest devices after the internet giant overhauled how Nest technology works with other gadgets.The Alphabet Inc. unit bought Nest in 2014 for $3.2 billion to enter the so-called smart-home market. Nest has become one of the largest makers of internet-connected thermostats, smoke alarms and locks.The devices were popular with builders who saw a Nest gadget as a way to increase the value of properties. But earlier this year, that began to change as Google exerted more control over Nest and started changing the underlying technology.As a more independent business, Nest developed software that helped its gadgets communicate with a wide range of products from other manufacturers, through accounts set up directly by users.As of the end of August this year, however, consumers need a Google account -- and access to the companyâs voice-based Google Assistant service -- to integrate new Nest products with other devices in their homes.The move may help the internet giant weave its Google Assistant deeper into peopleâs lives. But for builders itâs just a pain because Nest devices no longer work so well with the other gadgets they install in homes, such as audio and entertainment systems, and alarms and other security gear. Itâs also a less enticing user proposition with all the privacy permissions that Google Assistant requires.Thatâs spurred some builders -- who collectively purchase tens of thousands of Nest devices each year -- to avoid Nest products.âWeâve stopped,â said Mark Zikra, vice president of technology at CA Ventures, which builds and operates apartments, senior homes and other property. âIn an apartment complex weâre talking about 200, 300 devices that would be installed in one swoop and then all of a sudden everyone moves in. We donât have the luxury of being able to say âhey are you a Google person or are you a Honeywell person?ââSimilar sentiments were shared by others in the construction industry, including two large systems-integration firms that work with hundreds of builders across the U.S.For Sean Weiner, chief technology officer of Bravas Group, the main sticking point is Googleâs decision to tie its digital assistant to Nest products going forward. Bravas installs smart-home devices and audio systems in about 3,500 high-end homes a year, and the ability to connect to as many different gadgets as possible is the most important feature. Digital assistants canât handle these larger, more complex systems, according to Weiner.âIf we put that control in the hands of Google, weâve lost that control,â he said.This could dent Nest sales at a time when Google is trying to generate more revenue from consumer hardware. Commercial installers and builders are an important source of smart-home sales and Nest had developed a program to train professionals how to hook up its gadgets.Google has said it is being more selective with outside partners to increase security and privacy. At an event this week in New York City, the company highlighted how its home devices and smartphones work together to provide functionality that consumers canât get unless they go all-in with Google technology. Still, the company is working to increase the number of other devices Nest products work with.Thatâs little comfort for builders in the midst of existing projects, such as David Berman who has been installing electronics in homes since the 1960s. Now, his company sets up networks of smart-home devices in thousands of homes a year. When Google said Nestâs integration technology was changing earlier this year, he stopped using the devices.âWe were more or less forced into the switch,â he said. âWhen people buy a connected device, they expect it to connect. Thatâs not something that happens with Nest anymore.âGoogle isnât alone in trying to tie its devices to a digital assistant. Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. have pursued similar goals, and the smart-home market increasingly revolves around the tech giants, with manufacturers of light bulbs, thermostats, smoke alarms and more struggling to make their wares compatible with all three.Even though Nest has been owned by Google for five years, it hadnât been fully pulled into the internet giantâs orbit until now.When Google announced the acquisition in 2014, Nest said it would only share user data with its own products and services, not Googleâs. In a blog post, Nest co-founder Matt Rogers said âNest data will stay with Nestâ and that the company wasnât changing its Terms of Service.It didnât take long for that to change. And Rogersâs blog post is no longer available on Nestâs website. Less than six months after the deal, Nest said Google would connect some of its apps, letting Google know whether Nest users were at home or not. The integration allowed those people to set the temperature of their homes with voice commands and helped Googleâs digital assistant set the temperature automatically when it detected the people were returning home.Initially, smart-home products connected to âhome hubsâ that acted as a gateway linking many devices -- even if they used different communication standards and protocols. âThat idea has mostly diedâ as tech giants take over that central role with their voice assistants and smart speakers, said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research.âThis is a symptom of a larger challenge in the smart-home arena,â he added.Interoperability doesnât need to be compromised for security and privacy, said Aaron Emigh, chief executive officer of Brilliant Home Technology Inc., which makes a centralized hub that hosts Amazonâs Alexa voice assistant.Amazon put Brilliant through many tests, ranging from audio quality to the ability to stop hacks. The same hasnât happened with Google, he said. Google devices, such as its Home smart speakers, can be used to control Brilliantâs hub with your voice, but the integration is incomplete compared with Alexa, Emigh added.âWhat theyâre doing is creating a lot of mistrust around Google and thatâs then causing people to de-select Google and Nest as technology platforms,â Emigh said. âThatâs happening in droves.â&#92;--With assistance from Mark Bergen.To contact the reporter on this story: Gerrit De Vynck in New York at gdevynck@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/builders-ditch-nest-google-ties-100000008.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-19	2019-09-19 21:00:00	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	India Is Planning a Huge China-Style Facial Recognition Program	(Bloomberg) -- India is planning to set up one of the worldâs largest facial recognition systems, potentially a lucrative opportunity for surveillance companies and a nightmare for privacy advocates who fear it will lead to a Chinese-style Orwellian state.Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs government will open bids next month to build a system to centralize facial recognition data captured through surveillance cameras across India. It would link up with databases containing records for everything from passports to fingerprints to help Indiaâs depleted police force identify criminals, missing persons and dead bodies.The government says the move is designed to help one of the worldâs most understaffed police forces, which has one officer for every 724 citizens -- well below global norms. It also could be a boon for companies: TechSci Research estimates Indiaâs facial recognition market will grow sixfold by 2024 to $4.3 billion, nearly on par with China.But the project is also ringing alarm bells in a nation with no data privacy laws and a government that just shut down the internet for the last seven weeks in the key state of Kashmir to prevent unrest. While India is still far from implementing a system that matches Chinaâs ability to use technology to control the population, the lack of proper safeguards opens the door for abuses.âWeâre the only functional democracy which will set up such as system without any data protection or privacy laws,â said Apar Gupta, a Delhi-based lawyer and executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, a non-profit group whose members successfully lobbied the government in 2015 to ensure net neutrality and reject platforms like Facebook Inc.âs Free Basics. âItâs like a gold rush for companies seeking large unprotected databases.âBlack MarketA draft data protection bill presented to the government last year still hasnât been approved by the cabinet or introduced into parliament. The country has already had problems implementing Aadhaar, one of the worldâs biggest biometric databases linking everything from bank accounts to income tax filings, which been plagued by reports of data leaks and the growth of a black market for personal information.So far, not much is known about which companies might bid on the facial-recognition system. Minutes of a meeting with potential bidders, obtained by the Internet Freedom Foundation through a right to information request, showed unidentified companies sought clarifications on integrating facial recognition data with state databases and whether it should be able to identify people with plastic surgery.Vasudha Gupta, a spokeswoman for the Home Ministry, didnât respond to an email seeking comments about the system.For some in the police force, the system will be an essential tool to fight crime if implemented properly. India has seen more than 100 terrorist attacks in the last three decades, including one on luxury hotels and a train station in Mumbai that killed 166 people in 2008.âPowerful ToolâNilabh Kishore, who headed a unit fighting organized crime in the state of Punjab until last year, had success against gangsters after he set up a system linking data from police stations across the state.âA system that can identify criminals is invaluable -- facial recognition is a powerful tool,â said Kishore, who is now deputy inspector general of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police. âBut human intentions are also very important. You can make the best of technology, but if human intentions are wrong it can be a tool for misuse.âThatâs particularly a worry for vulnerable minority groups that have long faced discrimination in India. Lower castes and tribals account for about a quarter of the population but constitute 34% of Indiaâs prisoners, according to the National Dalit Movement for Justice.In January, the Delhi High Court said it was âunacceptableâ that facial recognition had not helped trace any of the 5,000 children missing from the city in three years. Earlier this month, photos and phone numbers from a Madurai city police facial recognition database in the southern state of Tamil Nadu were leaked online.Surveillance ThreatThe threat of foreign spying is also persistent. Last month a federal government think tank criticized the local administration in Delhi for hiring the Indian arm of Chinese firm Hikvision to set up 150,000 CCTVs, saying the move could spur illegal hacking and data leaks to the Chinese government.Foreign surveillance companies operating in India include CP Plus, Dahua, Panasonic Corp., Bosch Security Systems, Honeywell International Inc., and D-Link India Ltd. Many Indian companies wonât be able to bid on the facial-recognition system because the current tender requires them to meet standards established by the U.S. National Institute of Science and Technology, according to Atul Rai, chief executive officer of Staqu Technologies, an Indian startup.Rai, whose company has developed facial recognition for eight local police forces, said India doesnât have the same quality cameras as China -- making it harder to meet the goal of being able to identify any person with an integrated system. He also said it would be more difficult to implement a national network in India because state governments are responsible for law and order under its constitution.âBut if this one happens in line with the governmentâs plan, it should be a China-like system,â Rai said. âAny powerful country wants to be like China when it comes to using technology to monitor people -- even western countries.â&#92;--With assistance from Santosh Kumar.To contact the reporter on this story: Archana Chaudhary in New Delhi at achaudhary2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/india-planning-huge-china-style-210000500.html?.tsrc=rss

That's even as General Electric stock has remained well-above its December lows.  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now It has got investors wondering if there's been a &quot;change in tune&quot; with GE stock and if the sideways action will result in dead money -- or worse, losses -- rather than resolve higher. Before diving into the company, let's look at the technicals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Trading General Electric StockWe have been covering General Electric stock here on InvestorPlace for quite some time. It's no wonder, given its former place among America's blue-chip companies. That's no longer the case, even among its own industry. Names like Honeywell (NYSE:HON), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) are all considered superior entities.In any regard, we kept such a close eye on GE stock because of its tight trading range. Specifically, we continued to highlight range support at $9 and range resistance near $10.50. The latter elevated itself to around $10.70 in June and July, but we've seen a drastic shift in sentiment since.  Click to EnlargeInterestingly enough, those range levels have now doubled in significance, as it highlights two key Fibonacci retracements. The 38.2% retracement sits up at $10.60, while the 61.8% rests at $8.99.The question now is, can GE stock reclaim former range support and the 61.8% near $9?Last month, General Electric stock traded down to support and gapped below it, plunging to $7.65. On the subsequent retest though, this former support level acted as resistance, as GE again pulled back to sub-$8 levels. That's where the &quot;change in tune&quot; reference comes in.Now just under $9 again, bulls need to make a strong showing. If General Electric stock can reclaim the $9 level, it puts the 200-day moving average at $9.25 and the 50-day moving average at about $9.50 on the table.GE stock will need to reclaim those two key moving averages in order to get back to range resistance near $10.60.If $9 acts as resistance, August support at $8 is a possibility. Below that and the August lows, and sub-$7 is on the table. Key Analyst Will Move GE StockA key catalyst for General Electric stock has been JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa.Tusa upgraded GE from underweight to neutral in December, sparking an enormous rally. To be clear, he wasn't bullish, just less bearish given that the stock had gone from $30 to $7 in a relatively short period of time.Throughout the past few quarters -- through earnings and investor presentations -- Tusa has been critical of the company and of management's outlook. He has since gone back to his underweight rating. About a month ago, he wrote that the company's fundamentals &quot;continue to look negative.&quot;He still maintains an underweight rating and $5 price target on the stock, implying more than 45% downside. GE Stock GrowthFor the most recent quarter, General Electric stock beat on earnings and revenue expectations. It also provided better-than-expected guidance. But not everything was perfect in the quarter.For one, GE warned about headaches stemming from the grounding of Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes. Specifically, GE's cash flow could take a $1.4 billion hit if the planes remain grounded all year. It could also impact guidance.Growth is far from robust, too. Analysts expect revenue to decline almost 4% year-over-year in 2019. In 2020, estimates call for just a 70 basis point advance. The plus side is that revenue would be done going down in this scenario, but disappointing in that it's still sub-1%.GE is still a few years away from returning to any type of impressive growth for investors. In the meantime, it needs to focus on strengthening its balance sheet and improving its free cash flow. If it can attack the latter, investors -- and Tusa -- will take notice.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-09-16	2019-09-16 09:00:14	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Companies Arenât Putting Trumpâs America First	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- President Donald Trump promised to put America first when he campaigned for the White House. Today, after two and a half years of tax cutting, tariff boosting and assaults on globalization, foreign direct investment has fallen the most in almost two decades amid dwindling confidence by business leaders about continued U.S. prosperity.The 45th president roiled so many symbiotic relationships between the U.S. and its major trading partners in Canada, China, Europe, Japan and Mexico that chief executive officers here and abroad have grown skittish about long-term commitments during the No. 1 economy's record-long expansion. Instead of using most of their cash to build new plants or invest in new equipment, CEOs are putting more of it into buying back company shares.Trump inherited the only developed economy to rebound to a record gross domestic product and which produced the largest increase in jobs after the 2008 recession. But since he became president in 2017, net foreign direct investment in the U.S. tumbled 28% in his first year and another 25% in 2018, according to World Bank Group data compiled by Bloomberg. The last time the U.S. experienced such a double-digit loss in FDI over the first two years of a presidency was 2001 (-51%) and 2002 (-36%) when George W. Bush occupied the Oval Office.When Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 âÂ reducing the corporate rate to 21% from 35% and also adding more than $1 trillion to the budget deficitÂ âÂ he promised that the law would prompt U.S. and non-U.S. companies to put their repatriated overseas funds into new American facilities and jobs. At the same time, Trump abandoned the U.S. commitment to the 11-member Trans-Pacific Partnership, renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (belittling steadfast allies Canada and Mexico) and imposed tariffs on Chinese products sold to Americans. All of which, he predicted, would create a wave of investment from abroad.It's not happening. While foreign-owned companies have a history of investing more in research and development, wages and benefits than comparable U.S.-owned businesses, they're not rushing to the U.S., said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an interview with CNN last month. Instead of causing overseas firms to move operations to the U.S., Trump's tariffs tend to have the opposite effect because tariffs increase the cost of supplies foreign-owned companies would need to import to make their products, Hufbauer explained.Business leaders initially embraced Trumpâs tax cuts and rollback of President Barack Obama's environmental, health and consumer protections. When Chief Executive Magazine surveyed CEOs about their confidence after Trump was elected, he benefited from a surge of 1.7Â points, the largest 15-month gain since 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But their outlook changed at the beginning of 2018 when the same measure began its descent of 1.7 points, the biggest 19-month drop since April 2009 during the recession. Launched in the context of a beggar-thy-neighbor trade policy, the tax cuts proved ineffectual.Corporate America was more optimistic about its future under Obama, when the confidence measure rose 427 basis points during his first two years as president. That's also when billionaire investor Warren Buffett made the biggest bet on the nation's prospects when he acquired the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad for $44 billion. During Trumpâs first two years, it fell 49 basis points. The lack of confidence in Trump is unprecedented; when Bloomberg began compiling CEO-confidenceÂ data in 2002, it showed a boost of 280 basis points for George W. Bush during his first 24 months in the White House.Trump's tax cuts barely made a difference encouraging American companies to invest in themselves. While capital expenditures rose 9% in 2018 from the five-year average to $1 trillion for companies in the Russell 3000 Index, the money deployed for share buybacks and cash dividends increased 24% from the five-year average to $1.5 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Unlike Buffett's bullish-on-America railroad acquisition in 2009, Honeywell International Inc., the Charlotte, North Carolina-based multinational with sales in more than 30Â countries, last year spent $4 billion buying back its shares, or 38% more than in 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, the diversified technology and manufacturing company spent $828 million on capital expenditures in 2018, or 20% less than it did in 2017.Microsoft, the world's largest company with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion, put $14 billion into capital expenditures last year, an increase of 20% over 2017. But it also spent almost $20 billion buying back its shares, or 82% more than it did a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.CEOs tend to blame uncertainty for their hesitation. Trump's tax cuts, trade wars and criticism of the Federal Reserve ushered in a period of market volatility that hasn't been experienced since he ran for president in 2016 and, before that, since the climax of the financial crisis and its aftermath between 2008 and 2012. The standard measure of investor anxiety, which is the average implied volatility of the S&P 500, increased three percentage points during Trump's first two years in office, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Under Obama during the similar period, the same VIX Index fell 10 percentage points. The last time the VIX surged for two years into a new presidency was at the beginning of the new century when Bush's tax cuts brought the U.S. budget back to deficits after several years in balance.&#92;--With assistance from Shin Pei and Tom Lagerman.To contact the author of this story: Matthew A.

2019-09-11	2019-09-11 10:15:16	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	General Electric Is a Buy Despite the Markopolos Report	General Electric (NYSE:GE) finally looked to be out of the woods. GE stock bounced nicely earlier this year, and the company appeared to be turning things around. But a short seller has put GE stock back in the center of controversy once again. Harry Markopolos, famous for helping expose Bernie Madoff down, has sought out his next big target: General Electric.Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Markopolos dropped a 175-page report alleging all sorts of fraud and misrepresentations at GE. As a result, traders immediately dumped GE stock, though it quickly recovered much of its losses. Various analysts, including other short sellers, pointed out errors and hasty thinking in Markopolos' report. Still, many traders are operating under the thinking that where there's smoke there may be fire. GE stock has yet to reclaim the $10 per share mark following Markopolos' negative analysis of the firm.  * 7 Best Stocks That Crushed It This Earnings Season  Reasons For SkepticismAs InvestorPlace's James Brumley noted, there are many reasons to question the Markopolos report. For one, various folks ranging from bank analysts to fellow short sellers and even an ex-SEC chairman have suggested there were &quot;suspicious&quot; things about his work. Bronte Capital's fund manager John Hempton slammed the report as &quot;utterly misleading&quot; and &quot;flat-out silly&quot;.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile Markopolos deservedly earned his reputation with the Bernie Madoff investigation, it's far different going after a public company. It's one thing to expose a total ponzi scheme. But with GE, Markopolos is going after nuanced accounting things such as assumptions on long-term insurance policies where accountants can disagree.Look at something like Brighthouse Financial (NYSE:BHF) where the famed David Einhorn is long, short sellers are on the other side, and they are having a healthy debate around the value of its long-term insurance policies.Markopolos, by contrast, is running around screaming fraud while discussing complicated details.Why is Markopolos taking such a direct approach? He seems to be going for a financial reward. Markopolos is angling to earn money from an SEC whistleblower program along with working with a hedge fund that profits if the GE stock price goes down. These reasons would give Markopolos motivation to play up the incendiary language in his allegations. There Are Valid ConcernsWhile I'm skeptical about the Markopolos report and its intentions, there are some points the bears have latched onto that are worthy of further consideration. For example, GE has negative working capital -- and a lot of it. The figure pencils out around $10 to $20 billion depending on what all you count.What's this mean? General Electric owes more in short-term liabilities than it has in short-term assets. This can be a good thing. For example, think of a subscription business, where people pay you before you deliver a service to them. In the case of an industrial firm like GE, however, a large negative working capital position could mean the company is in weaker financial position than you'd think from a quick glance at its credit rating.In addition to the negative working capital point, analysts concede that Markopolos has some valid concerns on other things such as valuation marks on some divisions and how the value of long-term insurance contracts are calculated. But there's little evidence of anything close to outright fraud. It's Dangerous to Bet Against Larry CulpOne of the weirder things about calling GE a massive fraud is its management team. General Electric already cleaned the deck of its old team and brought in Larry Culp. For those unfamiliar, Culp was the longtime head of industrial powerhouse Danaher (NYSE:DHR). During Culp's tenure, Danaher stock appreciated roughly 500%. Culp is clearly a skilled leader, and there was no evidence of any wrongdoing in his previous highly-successful company.Once Markopolos leveled his charges against GE, Culp stepped in and bought GE stock aggressively. Culp said the allegations are baseless and defended the company with the strongest currency possible, his own money. In fact, Culp invested more in GE stock following the fraud claims than he invested in Danaher during his triumphant run at that firm. That's how much conviction Culp has that Markopolos is shooting blanks.Does a great leader guarantee that GE will succeed? Of course not. Sometimes even the greatest management teams face insurmountable challenges. And General Electric is admittedly in a pretty difficult situation. But in Culp, you have an honest and proven leader. GE Stock VerdictIf you're looking for a safe industrial stock to buy, don't pick GE. GE just announced its measly one cent quarterly dividend payment last week. That's a stark reminder of how far GE has fallen from when it was one of America's most respected blue chip holdings. If you want a safe reliable holding, something like Honeywell (NYSE:HON) or United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) is a better bet.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September But if you are willing to speculate on a turnaround with a decent shot at success, GE is interesting. This Markopolos report could be a blessing in disguise, as it has aired some pointed questions about GE's accounting and offered investors a lot more transparency into the firm. As folks get more comfortable with Culp's vision for an improved General Electric, shares could rally nicely in coming quarters.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned UTX and BHF stock.

2019-09-04	2019-09-04 08:07:15	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	3 Defense Stocks to Toughen Up Your Portfolio	August was a tough month for stock investors - the S&P 500 dropped 2% for the month. The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, and President Trumpâs mercurial approach to diplomacy, put a damper on stocks exposed to the Asian import-export trade. In the bond markets, the yield curve inverted â that is, the 10-year yield dipped below the 2-year yield, indicating a lack of investor confidence in the short-term markets, but more ominously the inversion is considered an accurate long-range recession predictor.The upshot was increased volatility. The S&P 500 had its second worst month this year, with half of Augustâs trading sessions seeing declines in the index. In response, classic defensive stocks â such as AT&T (T) and Procter & Gamble (PG) â have seen gains as investors sought safe havens. Here, weâll look at three such havens: defense stocks that are showing resilience in the face of current market conditions, and are attracting positive notice from the Streetâs top analysts. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC)Best known today for its line of military drones and the B-2 stealth bomber, Northrop Grumman has long been a mainstay of the US defense industry. Itâs a quality business niche that has served the company well, and the most recent quarterly earnings bear that out. NOC reported a 9% positive surprise in EPS, showing $5.06 per share against the $4.64 expected, on $8.46 billion in quarterly earnings. Along with the strong earnings performance, the company pays out a regular dividend. While the yield is modest, the payment is high at $5.28 annually.After the earnings report came out, 5-star Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn was duly impressed. He raised his price target on the stock by 5%, to $385 dollars, saying, âThe company has powerfully disrupted the low-growth bear narrative with Q2 results.â NOC shares have gained since Spingarn reviewed the company, and his price target on the stock suggests a 5% upside from current levels.NOCâs share price gains were pushed along by an upgrade from Morgan Stanleyâs Rajeev Lalwani, who moved his position from neutral to buy. He wrote, âNOC is well-positioned in the market. Its focus on high-end technology and other favorable factors make it the best long-cycle play.â While Lalwani declined to set a specific price target, his âlong-cycleâ comment indicates high confidence in the company.Northrop holds a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, and a robust $364 share price. The stock's recent gains have pushed it right up to the $366 average price target, leaving only a small upside, the outlook remains bullish and current trends are positive. Honeywell International, Inc. (HON)Honeywell may not be a household name, but you have probably used some of their products. Among the companyâs civilian-oriented products are such common appliances as thermostats and home security alarms. Honeywellâs aerospace segment is deeply involved in the defense industry, producing a wide array of component systems as well as several high-tech weapons and drones.All of this has provided returns for investors. In the July Q2 release, HON reported a modest EPS beat of 1%, showing $2.10 per share. Revenue just missed the expectation, due to several business spin-offs during the previous 12 months. The companyâs organic business showed a 5% improvement. And in a move that keeps investors happy, HON continues to reliably pay out its 2% dividend. At the current trading levels, the annualized payment is $3.28 per share.John Eade, of Argus, sees strength in Honeywellâs position despite the revenue miss. He writes, âWe expect momentum to continue as the company generates low double-digit earnings growth over the next 5 years. Honeywell stands to benefit from its diverse product lines, its strong presence in the commercial aerospace and commercial construction markets, as well as its mid-market product presence in China that is growing in spite of the country's infrastructure slowdown.â He gives HON shares a price target of $195, suggesting an upside potential of 19%.The analyst consensus on HON is a Strong Buy, based on 5 buys and 1 hold from the past three months. The stock is trading at $163, so the $187 average price target gives it a 14% upside. Note that even the low price target here of $177 is higher than the current share price. Boeing Company (BA)Boeing has been getting more than its share of news this year, and not all of it good. The companyâs 737 MAX-8 airliner â the best-selling model of its best-selling commercial aircraft â remains grounded world-wide in the aftermath of two fatal air crashes. Boeing management failed to allay customer and government worries after the crashes, and while it reports that it has a fix for the airlinerâs autopilot problem, it has yet to receive regulatory approval to make the upgrades.Even so, industry watchers see the company with a firm foundation. Its wide-body airliners remain in production, as do the F-15 and F-18 fighter programs. Boeing has committed to maintaining its high-paying dividend during these difficulties, rewarding investors for loyalty. That dividend, despite a modest yield of just 2.33%, pays out a high $8.22 per share annually.Boeing has shown strong recent gains in share price after Cowenâs 5-star analyst â and aerospace expert â Cai Rumohr reiterated his Buy rating on the stock. Rumohr notes that the company âhas updated MCAS software and is developing software for the flight control microprocessor, and is also working in parallel with airlines and regulators on pilot workload issues.â He adds that the FAA could hold a certification flight for the 737 MAX as early as mid-October, which would speed up Boeingâs timeline on returning the airliners to regular service. Rumohrâs $460 price target on BA indicates a potential 29% upside.With all of the headwinds it has faced, Boeingâs analyst consensus remains a Moderate Buy. The stock has received 11 buy ratings in the last three months, compared to 5 holds. Its average price target is $425, which suggests a healthy 20% upside compared to the $353 current share price.Visit TipRanks' Trending Stocks page, to find out which stocks Wall Street's top analysts like today.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-defense-stocks-toughen-portfolio-080715032.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-03	2019-09-03 18:18:49	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	5 Internet of Things Stocks to Buy Now	The internet of things has been a hot topic for years now, but with a 5G revolution right around the corner, connected devices are garnering more and more attention. Trade tension with China has made the market shaky, especially in the tech space. However, when it comes to picking stocks to buy in the technology sector, the internet of things is a great place to start.Here's a look at five stocks that offer exposure to the fast-growing internet of things market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Internet of Things Stocks to Buy: AT&T (T)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com If you're looking for internet of things stocks to buy, the first place to look is network providers. None of the connectivity needed would be possible without telecoms building and maintaining infrastructure to support it. If everything goes according to plan and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) merge, there are only three names to choose from on that list -- T-Mobile, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). A lot of people point to Verizon as the winner of the three, but the only telecom I'd be willing to bet on right now is T.   * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now T stock is cheap because the firm is weighed down by a massive debt pile that it acquired beefing up its content library in preparation for a new streaming service. Not everyone believes in AT&T's path forward, which explains the firm's ultra-low valuation. However, I think T stock's future looks bright in the streaming space and its position in 5G means the company has a definite future growth catalyst. With a near 6% dividend yield and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 9.7, T stock is a cheap way to buy into the revolution. Honeywell International (HON)Source:  josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Another internet of things stock that can't be overlooked is Honeywell (NYSE:HON), an American company responsible for a wide range of connected household devices. Honeywell not only makes everything from connected fire alarms to thermostats for consumers, but the firm also delivers a wide range of connected solutions at the enterprise level as well. There's a lot to like about HON stock from its modest P/E of 18.4 to its respectable 2% dividend yield to the fact that it's been able to grow its earnings per share by 14% annually for the past three years. However, what I find most compelling about Honeywell is the fact that the firm is making big moves into the internet of things space in an unprecedented way. HON is pushing forward with connectivity as a service, a strategy that combines connected wearables with cloud-based applications in order to assist customers in creating more efficient organizations.  DexCom (DXCM)Source: FOOTAGE VECTOR PHOTO / Shutterstock.com It would be irresponsible to talk about internet of things stocks to buy without mentioning at least one healthcare play. The healthcare space holds a lot of potential for growth when it comes to connected devices because data collection is such an important part of the industry. DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) makes glucose monitors for people living with diabetes. DXCM stock is up 43% so far this year, though it's been a bumpy ride for investors. In just two years, DXCM is up 128% as its devices gained notoriety and investors started to take notice.   * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off Of course there is some risk buying into a stock that's been on a run up, but DexCom looks likely to keep climbing in the years ahead as it rolls out new devices at more affordable price points. DexCom is planning to roll out a new glucose monitor in late 2020 or early 2021 that will be smaller than the firm's G6 model. Its lower manufacturing costs mean it will be less expensive for consumers. Management is hoping that the new G7 model will help the firm break into other markets beyond glucose monitoring which would create an entirely new growth runway. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Another industry that can't be overlooked when it comes to the internet of things is the semiconductor space. The chips that power connected devices and the networks themselves are an integral part of the overall future of the internet of things. However, choosing which semiconductor stocks to buy right now is a tricky business as the industry has been up against some pretty strong headwinds in recent months. My pick here is Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), a Massachusetts-based semiconductor firm whose share price has been on a roller coaster ride for the past year. The government's ban on sales to Huawei has hurt SWKS stock significantly --  in the third quarter the firm saw its revenue fall 14% and EPS were down a whopping 47%. However, the firm appears to be faring well in areas unaffected by the trade tension. The company is becoming a major player in the 5G space, and its connected chips can now be found in a variety of electronics including soundbars and smartwatches. The firm's tech is also included in Oculus headsets, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) virtual reality arm.So, although you're taking on a lot of risk considering that the trade war with China looks unlikely to let up anytime soon, SWKS could offer a great deal of reward as well. Not only will its connected chips drive growth in the future, but the firm's comparisons in 2020 will be much easier after the dismal year it's had. That means investors who can stomach the risk could see a payoff in just a few months time. Visa (V)Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com Payment processors will be another big beneficiary of a more connected world. As more and more devices make their way online, online payments will continue to rise. Part of the reason connected devices are gaining traction is that they reduce friction in people's lives. Cash has become friction for many people, leading developers to look for easier ways to allow people to pay for things without ever taking out their wallets. The two largest credit card networks, Visa (NYSE:V) and Master Card (NYSE:MA) will be able to continue building their networks as people continue to opt for cashless payments. Don't get me wrong, V stock is expensive -- it trades at almost 29 times its future earnings, but that extra cost is worth it. Visa makes money every time someone uses their credit or debit cards, and with trillions of dollars changing hands in Visa's name each year, that translates into some pretty impressive revenue figures. Guggenheim Securities analyst Jeff Cantwell said he also sees a lot of potential growth in Visa's business to business payments arm. Cantwell pointed out that V stock will benefit significantly as contactless payments spread and Visa pushes its way further into cross-border transactions, a $100 trillion market.As of this writing Laura Hoy was long FB and T.

2019-08-29	2019-08-29 09:01:26	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	The 2 Big Reasons Ford Stock Looks Good on This Dip	Here's a simple truth: Auto stocks don't do well in recessions. Long story short, cars are big ticket purchases, and when the economy slows and things are tight, consumers don't have the money or confidence to make big ticket purchases. As car demand plummets, auto company profits get wiped out, and auto stocks plunge.Source: Shutterstock Which explains why, as recession fears have ratcheted up in recent weeks, shares of U.S. auto giant Ford (NYSE:F) have taken a beating. From it's mid-July highs, Ford stock has slipped more than 15%.That's peanuts compared to what could happen. In each of three last major market downturns (2007-2008, 2000-2002, and 1990-1991), Ford stock lost roughly 50% or more of its pre-downturn value, including roughly 80% drops in 2007-2008 and 2000-2002, when the broader market only dropped about 50% each time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn other words, if a recession does materialize over the next 12 months, history says that Ford stock could get wiped out.But, I don't think that's going to happen. Instead, I think Ford stock actually looks tasty on the dip for two big reasons. One, the most likely outcome here is that a recession does not materialize over the next 12 months. Two, the current fundamental trends underlying Ford stock are actually improving.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More As such, I think overstated recession fears are creating a good buying opportunity in F stock. A Recession (Most Likely) Isn't ComingWhen it comes to all the recession chatter, one opinion I've heard sounds much truer than all the rest, and that is the opinion of Honeywell (NYSE:HON) CEO Darius Adamczyk. In a CNBC interview, Adamczyk basically said that while the economy is slowing, it's still doing pretty well, and that a recession will basically only happen if we talk ourselves into one.Spot on. I couldn't agree more.The media is freaking everyone out because panic talk sells better than &quot;everything is fine&quot; talk. What about the inverted yield curve? It's lost its predictive power because of distortion from QE which has produced negative government yields in many parts of the world. What about the trade war? It's a footnote -- total trade with China (exports plus imports) amounted to $650 billion last year, a measly 3% of the $20 trillion-plus U.S. economy. Slowing manufacturing activity? It happens, all the time, and most of the time, it reverses course and doesn't lead into a recession - see 2011-2012 and 2015-2016.In other words, all the &quot;recession indicators&quot; you've been reading about across the financial media landscape, are overstated headline risks which won't derail the U.S. economy. They will only become a real problem if enough people believe they are a real problem, and businesses stop investing and consumers stop spending.For the time being, that's not happening. Businesses and consumers are still spending. So long as that remains true, the economy will keep expanding.It's also worth noting that the economy has strong safety levers here. The Fed has essentially said that they will do what it takes to prolong the current economic expansion. U.S. President Donald Trump -- who has prided himself on having a strong economy -- is heading into an election year. He will likely do anything (including resolving the trade war) to get the economy on solid footing ahead of that election to increase his chances of winning.Net net, I don't see a recession coming. Ford's Fundamental Trends are ImprovingIf a recession doesn't materialize over the next 12 months, then buying Ford stock here seems like a smart move for four big reasons.First, and foremost, the stock is priced for a recession. The forward earnings multiple (7x) equals the dividend yield (7%). That means this stock is ridiculously cheap. On any good news, Ford stock has big upside potential.Second, Ford's volume and market share trends are improving. Fiscal 2018 was a rough year for the automaker in terms of volume and market share. Across Ford's entire automotive business, volumes dropped nearly 10% in fiscal 2018, while the company lost 0.7 percentage points of market share. In 2019, those trends have reversed course. Year-to-date, Ford's market share in North America is roughly flat year-over-year, while Europe volumes rose 3% in Q2 and China market share dropped by its smallest amount in Q2 in recent memory.  * 7 'Boring' Stocks With Exciting Prospects Third, Ford's domestic revenue trends appear to be on the cusp of a huge turnaround. Ford's North America revenues are down year-to-date. Their market share is not. The implication is that although the North America market is weakening, Ford's positioning in that market is actually starting to stabilize for the first time in a long time - mostly because Ford is electrifying is product portfolio and becoming more relevant to younger consumers. Consequently, if/when the North America auto market picks back up as recession fears back off, Ford's North America sales trends should significantly improve.Fourth, Ford's margin profile is improving. Fiscal 2018 was a year of big investment for Ford, and the company's margins took a hit as a result. In 2019, Ford has been able to reap the rewards of 2018's restructuring efforts. North America EBIT margins are up year-over-year. Losses in Europe and China are narrowing. Global auto EBIT margins are up. Importantly, this uptrend in margins should continue over the next few quarters as recharged demand converges on cost-cutting measures. Bottom Line on Ford StockIf a recession materializes over the next 12 months, Ford stock is in for some serious pain.I think the possibility of that happening is quite small. The far more likely outcome here is that the economy shakes off near term slowdown concerns, and returns to healthy growth in 2020. If so, F stock is due for a pretty big rally over the next 12 months as an economic resurgence converges on favorable underlying trends for the company.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long F.

2019-08-23	2019-08-23 09:00:46	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Prince Harryâs Shaming Is Bad News for Private Jets	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Given the swelling ranks of the worldâs billionaires, youâd have thought the past 10Â years would have been fabulous for private jet suppliers.In reality, the period since the great recession has been a âlost decadeâ for the industryâs manufacturers, analysts say. A glut of second-hand aircraft sapped demand for new models, while shared ownership and renting became popular alternatives to buying a plane outright. Meanwhile, large corporations that once thought nothing of jetting their execs around in comfort started scrutinizing budgets and worrying about conspicuous excess. In 2017 General Electric Co. said it would sell its fleet after unflattering reports about its former boss, Jeff âtwo planesâ Immelt.The industry seemed to have turned a corner recentlyÂ thanks to the U.S. economic recovery, a fresh lineup of bigger models, plus tax giveaways from President Donald TrumpÂ that made it much cheaper to purchase a plane. North America is expected to accountÂ for more than half the global market for private jets in the next five years, according to Honeywell International Inc.Yet suppliers face another looming threat: Our rapidly heating planet might make boarding a fuel-guzzling jet seem unconscionable. In Sweden thereâs even a word for this new aversion to flying:Â flygskam or âflight shame.âÂ Are the super-wealthy 1% susceptible too?Itâs not just climate campaigners who think the industry has an image problem. Warren East, chief executive of the jet engine-maker Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, said recently that aviation as a whole âis built on setting fire to hydrocarbonsâ and needs to wean itself off that âquite quickly.â Bombardier Inc., owner of the Learjet brand, warned in its annual report thatÂ âthe impact to us and our industry from legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change is likely to be adverse and could be significant.âThe globe-trotting business elite and A-list celebrities who once made private jets such desirable status symbols certainly arenâtÂ helping the industryâs image problem, with the media increasingly taking issue with those who preachÂ the environmentalist faith while turning up at events in their Gulfstreams.The British royal Prince Harry has been dubbed theÂ âCarbon Footprinceâ by his countryâs press after taking several private flights to the Mediterranean this summerÂ despite hisÂ outspokenness on ecological issues. Itâs doubly ironic that one of those journeys was to Alphabet Inc.âs four-day climate change summit in Sicily, where an epic queue of private jets rather undermined the well-intendedÂ activism.You can see what the critics are getting at from a âdo as I say, not what I doâ perspective.Â Travelling by private jet produces several times more carbon dioxide than purchasing anÂ economy seat on aÂ commercial flight (precisely how much depends on how many people are on board and whether the jet flies home empty). The average American is responsible for about 16 tons of CO2 emissions per year. Thatâs already three times the global average, but itâs only a fraction of what private jets produce in a typical year.As such, the tax advantages for private jets areÂ very hard to justify. Nor is it helpful that many operators will be exempt from the aviation industryâs commitment â known as Corsia â to cap net emissions at 2020 levels and to halve these by 2050.(1)Banning private jets, as some haveÂ suggested, wouldnât do much to curb climate change as there are only about 20,000 of them operatingÂ today. The aviation industry accounts for about 2%-3% of global emissions and private jets perhaps pump out as little as 0.04% of the total, according to industry groups.But symbolismÂ matters in the climate debate. If private jet users arenât seen to be doing their bit, they canât reasonably expect poorer folkÂ to make sacrifices either. While the purchase of carbon offsets to make up for the impact is worthy and rational, intellectual justifications are a hard sell on this topic.Of course, private jets arenât just frivolous toys, they have their uses too as a time-saving deviceÂ forÂ executives. As such, their users and makers will be eager to combat any burgeoning environmental backlash through the development ofÂ cleaner technologies.Â Carbon efficiency no doubt will become as important as time efficiency in selling planes.Startups such as Eviation, as well as incumbent manufacturers and suppliers, are already plowing money into hybrid and electric aircraft. The industry is also trying to encourage operators to use non-petroleum fuels, although theyâre expensive and hard to get hold of.Â Because of the limited energy density of batteries, itâs probable thatÂ smaller aircraft will be the first to go electric. In the meantime, my guess is that rich folkÂ will think twice before posting a shotÂ of their plush planes on Instagram. The Swedes have a word for that too:Â smygflygaÂ â âflying in secret.âÂ Â (1) Planes with a maximum takeoff weight of below 5700kg and operatorswith fewerthan 10,000 tonnes of annual carbon emissions are excluded. The private jet industry says it will pursue voluntarily the same goals anyway.To contact the author of this story: Chris Bryant at cbryant32@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.

2019-08-16	2019-08-16 14:23:26	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Shopifyâs Success Puts Spotlight on Next Canadian Tech Stars	(Bloomberg) -- Shopify Inc.âs scorching rally and Lightspeed POS Inc.âs successful trading debut this year are throwing the spotlight on who might be the next Canadian tech star to go public.A total of C$1 billion ($751 million) was invested in 142 venture capital deals in the first quarter, up 48% from a year earlier, according to the Canadian Venture & Private Equity Association. More than half of that was in tech and increasingly from U.S. investors.Hereâs what the founders of some of Canadaâs hottest tech firms are saying about the future of their companies, and the potential for initial public offerings:ClearbancClearbanc offers $10,000 to $10 million to startups to help fund their marketing campaigns on Facebook, Google and the like in return for a flat fee and a share of revenue.The Toronto-based investment firm, founded in 2015, raised $300 million in new funding led by Highland Capital Partners of the U.S., the largest disclosed VC-financing this year in Canada. That brings total funding to $420 million.Clearbanc plans to offer $1 billion in financing this year and is interested in funding parts of a business that could turn into a repeatable revenue stream--infrastructure, shipping and sales commissions.Itâs expanding outside the U.S. and Canada, where thereâs a less developed venture ecosystem and âbanks are more conservative,â according to co-founder and chief executive officer, Andrew DâSouza.âWe think that the fundamentals of the business, the market opportunity, justifies a large standalone business,â DâSouza said about the possibility of an IPO.WattpadWattpad Corp. may no longer be a startup but its ambitions just keep growing. Founded as a mobile-reading app, 12-year-old Wattpad now calls itself a âmulti-platform entertainment company.âThe Toronto-based company has provided content for one of the most re-watched movies on Netflix (âThe Kissing Boothâ), a Hulu series (âLight as a Featherâ), and this year a Hollywood feature film (âAfterâ), all through Wattpad Studios, launched in 2016.Last week it inked a deal with Penguin Random House in the U.K. to turn its online content, mainly created and read by young women, into books. That follows the launch of its own publishing imprint, Wattpad Books, in the U.S. in April.The company uses data from more than 80 million monthly active users to identify the best stories across its platform and turn them into content. It has launched a paid, ad-free version as well as exclusive content for a fee.Wattpad has raised $117.8 million from investors including OMERS Ventures, Tencent Holdings Ltd.âs capital arm, and August Capital Corp, and is generating revenue in âeight figures,â according to co-founder and chief executive, Allen Lau.As for an IPO, itâs ânot what we spend time focusing on,â Lau said. âOur focus right now is on movies and TV shows, with our partners.âVidyardVidyard Inc. wants to be the YouTube of business videos. Its software allows companies to create personalized videos to engage with customers and use data from their viewing habits to analyze that engagement.Companies are expected to spend $103 billion annually in video-ad marketing by 2023, according to Forrester Research.Vidyard counts 1,200 businesses in over 170 countries as its customers, including enterprise customers such as Honeywell International Inc., LinkedIn and Citibank.âIn terms of the next two to three years, weâre just focused on consistent, hockey-stick style growth,â says Devon Galloway, co-founder and chief technology officer at Kitchener, Ontario-based Vidyard.The company has raised $60 million to date from investors including OMERS Ventures, Inovia Capital and the venture capital arm of Salesforce Inc.Galloway said if Vidyard continues to grow as well as it has an IPO would certainly be on its path.WealthsimpleWealthsimple Inc., wishes to replace banks as a customerâs primary financial relationship, according to founder and CEO Michael Katchen.âWe want to be a firm that demystifies money,â Katchen said in an interview in Bloombergâs Toronto office. The investment-services company has more than C$5 billion in assets under management and 175,000 customers in Canada, the U.S. and U.K.The robo-adviser favored by millennials, is also targeting wealthier Canadians and has branched out into commission-free stock trading and savings products. Mortgages, life insurance and checking accounts could be next, Katchen said.Founded in 2014, WealthSimple is not yet profitable, but its backers are patient, Katchen said. These include Power Financial Corp., an investment arm run by the Desmarais family and Allianz SE.Katchen said heâs interested in an IPO but itâs still âa few years away.â(Updates with Clearbancâs financing plan)To contact the reporter on this story: Simran Jagdev in Toronto at sjagdev1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jacqueline Thorpe at jthorpe23@bloomberg.net;David Scanlan at dscanlan@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shopify-success-puts-spotlight-next-142326554.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-08	2019-08-08 17:08:54	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Expect to Wait for General Electric Stock to Turn Around	General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock is reeling after an earnings disappointment. Shares in the conglomerate have fallen more than 10% since announcing earnings July 31. The GE stock price opened at $10.76 on July 31, and has since slid to a close of $9.57 on August 6.Source: Shutterstock With quarterly sales down 1%, and total orders down 4%, the turnaround led by CEO Lawrence Culp remains a work in progress. Since 2018, investors have tried to call a bottom in GE stock. Some said the bottom would be $10 a share, only to see the stock fall as low as $6.51 a share in December. While shares have appreciated since the start of 2019, this recent earnings disappointment calls into the question the rebound of General Electric stock.  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates So what is the verdict on GE stock? Is the company's turnaround plan still in motion, or will the company experience additional headwinds? Let's take a closer look, and see whether investors can expect upside in the GE stock price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A Closer Look at General Electric StockAs mentioned above, GE's second quarter 2019 earnings failed to meet expectations. The year-over-year revenue declines were largely attributable to issues in the Power segment. The unit saw sales drop 25% from the prior year's quarter. Segment profits were down 71%. But GE's other units had performance issues of their own. The company's Renewable Energy segment saw significant revenue growth (26% year-over-year), but posted a segment loss of $184 million. Aviation saw sales bump up 5%, but segment profits were down 6% from the prior year's quarter.Healthcare was the only segment that saw an improvement in operating earnings, with quarterly segment profit up 3% from the second quarter of 2018. The Oil & Gas unit saw a 7% revenue increase, but a 2% decline in segment profit. GE Capital, the company's most complex and troubled segment, was able to trim losses from continued operations. Combined with gains from discontinued operations, GE Capital earned $148 million in the second quarter.But despite this tepid performance, the company has improved their outlook for 2019. In March, the company projected revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digits for the year. Now, the company believes sales will grow in the mid-single digits. The adjusted EPS (earnings-per-share) forecast has improved from a range of 50 cents to 60 cents, up to a range of 55 cents to 65 cents. GE even reduced their projected restructuring costs from $2.4-$2.7 billion, down to $1.7-$2 billion.In the short-term, GE stock faces headwinds. Long-term, the Culp-led turnaround is still in play. Does this make General Electric stock a buy today? Let's take a look at valuation and see if investors should buy at the current GE stock price. GE Stock Valuation: In Line With PeersGeneral Electric stock currently trades at a forward Price-to-Earnings (Forward P/E) ratio of 21.7. The company's trailing twelve month Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio is 13.5. Here are the valuations of GE's peers in the industrial conglomerate space:Danaher (NYSE:DHR): Forward P/E of 24.7, EV/EBITDA of 21.9Honeywell (NYSE:HON): Forward P/E of 18.8, EV/EBITDA of 14.3Textron (NYSE:TXT): Forward P/E of 12, EV/EBITDA of 93M (NYSE:MMM): Forward P/E of 16.2, EV/EBITDA of 14United Technologies (NYSE:UTX): Forward P/E of 15, EV/EBITDA of 12The valuation of GE stock is in line with peers. GE's EV/EBITDA number may be skewed by the GE Capital unit, which utilizes a great deal of leverage. Nevertheless, investors are not paying a premium for General Electric stock. On the other hand, they are not getting a tremendous bargain. But with the company in the midst of a turnaround, operating earnings could materially improve, helping to boost the GE stock price.But with recent stumbles, can Lawrence Culp successfully pull off a turnaround? As the former CEO of Danaher, investors have high expectations for his skills as an operator. Danaher saw significant long-term stock appreciation thanks to its ability to generate high operating margins from mature industrial businesses. Can Culp do the same for GE? Bottom Line: GE Stock Has PotentialGeneral Electric stock has potential. But many stocks have &quot;potential.&quot; The question is whether the company can pull off a turnaround, remaking itself as a high-margin industrial conglomerate. If Culp can do for GE what he did at Danaher, the company could see not only improvements in earnings, but an enhanced stock valuation. This means significant upside in the GE stock price.For investors entering the stock today, do not expect things to turn around by next quarter. In fact, I would not be surprised if GE stock took another tumble. But for long-term investors looking to make a contrarian bet, GE is a strong opportunity.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-24	2019-07-24 13:57:39	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Caterpillarâs Grim Outlook Bulldozes Wishful Thinking	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As investors pore over every earnings report for the very latest read on the economy,Â Caterpillar Inc. provided freshÂ evidence that the slowdown in manufacturing is no blip.Â The maker of bulldozers and mining machinery said Wednesday that its 2019 earnings would fall on the low end of its guidance range, snapping a streak of quarterly boosts to its outlook. Caterpillarâs pain points were similar to those that have routinely popped up in industrial companiesâ results so far this second quarter: rising manufacturing costs, moderating demand and weakening confidence in the prospects for a second-half rebound. After a bizarre Tuesday turn in trading, whenÂ industrial companies includingÂ Pentair Plc and Sherwin-Williams Co. got resoundingly rewarded for cuts to their sales guidance, the glum outlook from an economic bellwether like Caterpillar seems to have shakenÂ the market out of its reverie.Â  Shares of Caterpillar slumped about 5% in early trading.Caterpillar continues to expect a modest sales increase in 2019, but that assumes oil and gas markets recover toward the end of the year, and that dealers work through inventory buildups and are able to accept the price increases the company is banking on to offset increased costs. Those assumptions seem tenuous.Dealersâ inventories of machines and engines climbed by $500 million in the second quarter, compared with a $100 million rise in the year-earlier period. But Caterpillarâs backlog slumped by about $1.9 billion relative to the first quarter, implying a softer demand environment. Meanwhile, sales of oil and gas equipment in North America declined in the second quarter, in part because of weaker demand in the Permian Basin. Halliburton Co. earlier this week announced an 8% cut to its North American workforce and said it would park unused fracking equipment rather than chase after market share. The oilfield services provider echoed Schlumberger Ltd.âs expectationsÂ for further sluggishness in the region in the secondÂ half of the year, even as international markets deliver robust growth. Itâs also worth noting that the competitive pricing pressure in Asia that so spooked Caterpillar investors in the first quarter isnât fading away. Sales of construction products slumped 22% in the region in the second quarter.Caterpillarâs results came as IHS Markitâs euro-area manufacturing gauge signaled the steepest contraction in more than six years and Germanyâs factory Purchasing Managerâs Index fell to the lowest level in seven years. A gauge of U.S. factories showed activity is hovering on the borderline between expansion and contraction in the lowest reading since 2009. The slowdown in this sector appears to be deepening and I remain skeptical that a quarter-point cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve would be enough to motivate the kind of investment surge that could reverse that trend.Elsewhere in industrials, aerospace has remained a haven this earnings season, with strong organic sales growth in the Honeywell International Inc. and United Technologies Corp.âs units that sell engines and aircraft parts. But itâs worth noting that Boeing Co.âs backlog is shrinking. The planemakerÂ  also reported results on Wednesday, and said its commercial backlog included more than 5,500 airplanes valued at $390 billion, down from more than 5,600 planes valued at $399 billion at the end of the first quarter. Thatâs likely at least in part a reflection of the fact that the embattled 737 Max is now in the fifth month of a global grounding following two fatal crashes. But should aerospace start to wobble, then weâre really in trouble.

2019-07-19	2019-07-19 20:01:17	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Cellphones a Flight Risk? Could Be on Some Boeing Jets	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. government officials in 2014 revealed an alarming safety issue: Passenger mobile phones and other types of radio signals could pose a crash threat to some models of Boeing 737 and 777 airplanes.More than 1,300 jets registered in the U.S. were equipped with cockpit screens vulnerable to interference from Wi-Fi, mobile phones and even outside frequencies such as weather radar, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, which gave airlines until November 2019 to replace the units made by Honeywell International Inc. Honeywell estimates that 70 or fewer planes with cockpit screens in need of repair are still flying.Flight-critical data including airspeed, altitude and navigation could disappear and âresult in loss of airplane control at an altitude insufficient for recovery,â the FAA said in its 2014 safety bulletin, known as an airworthiness directive.A Honeywell spokeswoman said there have been no reports of display units blanking in-flight due to high-intensity radio frequency/Wi-Fi interference. Airlines and Honeywell have argued that radio signals were unlikely to cause safety problems during flight. The FAA, however, concluded there were safety risks based on assessments it had received from a vendor and an operator.Boeing Co. found the interference in a laboratory test in 2012 and hasnât seen similar issues on other aircraft, a company spokesman said. Honeywell is aware of only one case where all six display units in a 737 cockpit went blank, company spokeswoman Nina Krauss said. The cause was a software problem, unrelated to Wi-Fi or cellphones, that has been fixed and is currently being flight-tested, she said.The affected 737s are the so-called Next Generation model, a predecessor of the Boeing Max, which was involved in two crashes in less than five months. Cockpit displays on the Max were made by Rockwell Collins, now a unit of United Technologies Corp., not Honeywell. Boeingâs 777s also were covered by the FAA order.The FAA order didnât quantify the amount of radio signals needed to cause interference problems. An agency spokesman said Thursday that the FAA bases the compliance time for its airworthiness directives on the risk that a condition poses. âA 60-month compliance time frame means the risk is low, and does not need to be addressed right away,â he said.Still, the radio-signal threat extends beyond that specific display system and FAA warning.Numerous mobile phones left on during any airplane flight âcould be a real problem,â said professor Tim Wilson, department chair for electrical, computer, software and systems engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The greater the number of phones emitting radio signals, he said, the greater the potential for interference with a planeâs flight system.Airplane ModeMany airlines now permit passengers to turn their phones to âairplane mode,â which allows Wi-Fi transmissions. But mobile phones operate at higher power levels, Wilson said, since the signals must reach a cell tower and not just a local antenna or router. âSo cellular service is potentially more impactful,â he added.The FAA in 2013 began the process of allowing wider use of electronic devices on planes, provided airlines could demonstrate it was safe. That prompted an outcry from consumer groups concerned about passengers being subjected to the mobile phone conversations of seatmates.No U.S. airlines allowed it and, in 2018, Congress barred the use of mobile phones for calls during flights.Honeywell says that 70 or fewer planes with affected display screens require repair. That may leave a lot of screens unaccounted for.A plane generally has six display screens. Back in 2014 Honeywell told the FAA that 10,100 display units -- or the equivalent of nearly 1,700 planes -- were affected worldwide. When asked this week about the progress of the fixes, Honeywellâs Krauss said that 8,000 of those screens were replaced and fewer than 400 components, or the equivalent of about 70 planes, still need to be fixed. That still leaves 1,700 units, or the equivalent of about 280 planes, unaccounted for out of the 2014 figure.Honeywell says its calculation of 70 or fewer assumes that some airlines might have had the work performed at non-Honeywell facilities, and regulators in other regions of the world might not have ordered the units replaced. In addition, some planes might have been taken out of service due to age. The actual number of planes operating with faulty components couldnât be determined by Bloomberg.Krauss said that âeven if a blanking incident were to occur,â the units are backed up by multiple redundancies.Both Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. have completed their overhauls, according to the companies. American Airlines Group Inc. has 14 more jets that need refurbished units, and United Airlines still needs to replace components across 17 aircraft, representatives from those companies said.Ryanair Holdings Plc, the large Irish-based discount carrier, told the FAA in 2014 that its planes held 707 of the affected Honeywell units and argued at the time that changing out all of them âis imposing a high, and unnecessary, financial burden on operators.â A Ryanair spokeswoman said the airline hasnât upgraded all 707 screens but that the carrier inspected all of its display units and âany affected DUs have been replaced.â(Corrects story first published on July 18 to clarify in the second and 13th-15th paragraphs the estimated number of planes still flying with affected display screens; rephrase Honeywellâs comment and clarify the FAAâs conclusions in the fourth paragraph; and provide more details on the cause of a blanking incident in the fifth paragraph.

2019-07-19	2019-07-19 19:00:02	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	CSX Leads Industrial Earnings Off the Rails	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- To get Brooke Sutherlandâs newsletter delivered directly to your inbox, sign up here.Itâs going to be unbearably hot across much of the U.S. this weekend, but the early returns on industrial earnings have been decidedly cool. A nearly 30% run in CSX Corp. shares heading into its second-quarter earnings report suggested this was a company where investors thought they could find shelter amid a growing body of worrisome manufacturing data. They were wrong. The shares slumped more than 10% the day after CSX reversed a forecastÂ for low single-digit growthÂ in revenue this year and predicted instead that revenue would dip as much as 2%. The East Coast railroad says itâs being cautious, but the time for conservatism is when you start the guidance-giving process,Â so that strikes me as an inadequateÂ explanation for such a deep cut. CEO James Foote said the macroeconomic backdrop was one of the most âpuzzlingâ heâs ever experienced and that there are no concrete signs of improvement in weak coal, intermodal and industrial volumes.Elsewhere in transportation, J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. and West Coast railroad Union Pacific Corp. actually saw their shares pop on earnings, but that seems to be a case of more realistic expectations than a drastically more positive view of the macroeconomic environment. J.B. Hunt was essentially flat going into earnings, for example, and Union Pacific had sold off in sympathy with CSX before it reported. Union Pacific said it expects second-half volume to be down about 2%, which implies a decline for the full year compared with an earlier call for a low-single digit gain â basically mimicking CSXâs move. The other challenge with CSX is that it appears to be far enough along in its conversion to precision-scheduled railroading that there isnât as much fat left to cut as there is at Union Pacific. But itâs track record of improved performance is still relatively short, capping its ability to make market share gains amid a surplus of capacity and lower spot rates in the trucking market.Â Bloomberg NewsâsÂ Cameron Crise points out the sharp divergence in the performance of S&P 500 railroads and FedEx Corp. over the past, calling it a proxy of sorts for the trade war-inspired slowdown thatâs hit companies with international exposure like FedEx harder than those focused on the domestic market. If U.S. railroad stocks fail to recover from the CSX-inspired selloff and the gap to FedEx narrows, that could be a sign that the domestic economy and the bull market are running out of steam, he writes. FedEx, of course, has plenty of idiosyncratic issues holding back its stock. The companyâs annual report filed this week included interesting disclosures abut the risk of an activist shareholder getting involved and some additional detail on the logistics investments that could render Amazon.com Inc. a competitor.Â Things were a bit better at the multi-industrial companies, but there was still cause for concern. Textron Inc. said its aviation backlog slipped by $100 million in the second quarter as macroeconomic concerns and President Donald Trumpâs threat to impose wide-ranging tariffs on Mexico spooked business-jet customers. Thatâs counteracted by Honeywell International Inc.âs report of double-digit sales growth for new business jet equipment, but still a troubling sign of just how nervous people are about making big investments. You can usually count on Honeywell to churn out an earnings beat, and the company didnât disappoint, raising its profit guidance for the full year. But the outlook wasnât as robust as some analystsÂ were expecting. Organic sales growth of 5% could end up being the pace to beat this quarter, but that was weaker than anticipated and a forecastÂ for 2% to 4% growth in the third quarter would suggest an accelerating slowdown. The dynamic of somewhat disappointing sales numbers but steady earnings growth in some ways reinforces Honeywellâs argument that last yearâs breakups and a pristine balance sheet will make it more resilient in a downturn, but I remain unconvinced that margins for anything except funeral homes are recession-proof. It helped Honeywell that the sales weakness was mostly confined to its safety and productivity solutions unit, the smallest of its four main businesses, and aerospace remained impressively robust with 11% organic sales growth. The industrial companies on tap to report earnings next week may not be so lucky, particularly 3M Co., which seems destined for yet another guidance cut to reflect the deepening slowdown.ALL BOEING WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS IS A FLYABLE MAXBoeing Co. this week pre-announced a $4.9 billion after-tax second-quarter charge to reflect its estimate of compensation owed to airlines grappling with a grounding of the beleaguered 737 Max thatâs now entering its fifth month. American Airlines Group Inc., Southwest Airlines Co. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. this week pulled the Max from their schedules through the beginning of November â a timeline that jibes with Boeingâs call for the plane to return to service during the fourth quarter. But the risk remainsÂ that the grounding stretches into 2020. The Federal Aviation Administration, mindful of restoring its reputation as the global standard-bearer of safety protocol, is keen to coordinate a return to service with European and Asian regulators. And while a fix for the flight-software system linked to the Maxâs two fatal crashes has essentially been completed, there remain hurdles to remedying a separate issue with a microprocessor that was identified in June, including convincing the FAA that a software update is sufficient, according to the Wall Street Journal. Even if Boeing can get the plane recertified and flying again by the fourth quarter, it matters a great deal whichÂ particular month that happens. Airlines estimate it will take a month to 45 days to completeÂ the maintenance necessary to bring the Max jets they already operate out of storage, which is to say nothing of the additional planes they had been expecting to support busy schedules. I would imagine airlinesâ demands for compensation would rise materially if they are forced to scramble and reassess capacity for holiday flights. Ryanair Holdings Plc said this week itâs prudently planning for a December return of the Max, but pared its growth plans for the 2020 summer travel season. It can only accept six to eight new Max planes per month, which will leave the budget airline with about half of the fleet it had been planning on for that peak season. Data points like that make me highly skeptical of Boeingâs aspirations to ramp up to a 57-per-month production pace for the 737 program in 2020.A WORD ON WAREHOUSESThere has been a surge of spending over the past few years on industrial warehouse assets. The latest deal cameÂ this week , whenÂ Prologis Inc. agreed to buy Industrial Property Trust and its 236 properties in areas such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago and New Jersey for about $4 billion. This follows PrologisâsÂ acquisition of DCT Industrial Trust Inc. last year for more than $8 billion and its pursuit earlier this year of GLP Pteâs U.S. warehouse assets, which ultimately went to Blackstone Group LP instead for $18.7 billion. Meanwhile, Tom Barrackâs Colony Capital Inc. is exploring a sale of its unit that owns warehouses as part of a strategic review meant to resuscitate its plunging market value, according to Bloomberg News. I understand the logic of these deals: Retailers are under immense pressure to build out their e-commerce capabilities and shorten their delivery times and on the face of it, that trend looks less vulnerable to the trade war and macroeconomic uncertainties than many others. Even so, it gives me pause to hear Honeywell say customers for its Intelligrated warehouse-automation business are pushing major system rollouts into the second half of the year. Intelligrated is still growing rapidly, with organic sales growth of more than 20% for the first half of 2019, and Honeywell CEO Darius Adamczyk said he knew for a fact that the delayed orders hadnât gone away. But going back to my earlierÂ comment about funeral homes, Iâm getting less confident that even this trend can withstand the test of a true downturn. I asked Bloomberg Opinion's retail expert Sarah Halzack what she thought. She pointed out that companies like Walmart Inc. and Williams-Sonoma Inc. are too far along in converting their businesses to e-commerce to back out, whereas those who are already struggling such as J.C. Penney Co. will find it harder to justify making those kinds of investments.DEALS, ACTIVISTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCEJohn Flannery has resurfaced. The former CEO of General Electric Co.Â will now be an advisory director to Charlesbank Capital Partners, a middle-market private equity firm managing more than $5 billion of capital. Iâve always felt a bit bad for Flannery, who spent 30 years working his way up the ladder at GE and finally ascended to the CEO post, only to find out that his actual job was going to be more akin to a garbage man. Sure, he made his share of mistakes as CEO. But the reality is he was probably never going to last in that job no matter what he did. GE needed one CEO to publicize and unearth the skeletons in its closet ($22 billion goodwill writedown on the disastrous Alstom SA deal, $15 billion reserve shortfall in the long-term care insurance business) and another CEO to try to fix the mess. Thatâs now Larry Culp. Still, it has to sting a bit that Steve Bolze, Flanneryâs competitor in the race to succeed Jeff Immelt, is a senior managing director at Blackstone, a slightly more prominentÂ firm than Charlesbank. Bolze is blamed by many investors for mismanaging GEâs power unit and exacerbating the financial pain from a slump in gas turbine demand.Crane Co.âs bid for Circor International Inc. got a last minute surge of support. Mario Gabelliâs Gamco Investors Inc. agreed to tender sharesÂ to Crane after the buyer raised its price to $48 a share earlier this month. Roughly 45% of outstanding Circor shares have been elected to be tendered, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. Thatâs not enough to force a merger (although there are still a few more hours before the tender offer expires at midnight), but it should be enough to get the attention of Circorâs boardâs. In the wake of the Crane offer, Circor laid out a bold (and by nature, rather fluffy) plan to boost margins and lower debt. Shareholders are now signaling quite loudly that they donât have much faith in the companyâs ability to follow through. Itâs pretty remarkable to see this level of pushback outside of an annual meeting, though. I had worried Craneâs bid might have been the victim of bad timing, with its offer becoming public a few weeks after Circorâs 2019 meeting. The fact that Circorâs board had privately received the Crane offer prior to the meeting and didnât feel a need to tell investors about it has been one of Gabelliâs chief criticisms. This level of support from Circor shareholders may save Crane from having to wait a year to relaunch its bid with a proxy fight.Osram Licht AG, the lighting maker thatâs agreed to sell itself to Bain Capital and Carlyle Group LP, disclosed this week that Austrian industrial manufacturer AMS AG had made a fresh offer for the company at a higher price. Bain and Carlyle are offering 35 euros per share, or 3.4 billion euros ($3.8 billion), while AMS had proposed to pay 38.50 euros per share, or about 3.7 billion euros. The problem is, AMS itself is valued at less than what it offered for Osram; itâs had negative free cash flow for at least the past two years; and itâsÂ already carrying about 1.2 billion euros of net debt. Osram agreed to let AMS perform due diligence, but said the probability of a deal materializing was ârather low.â Literally the same day that its latest offer was disclosed, AMS said it was walking away. In some ways thatâs actually kind of surprising â why wouldnât you take the opportunity to do due diligence? But anyway, this amusing M&A adventure has now come to an end.Callon Petroleum Co. agreed to buy Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at $3.2 billion including debt. Bernstein analyst Bob Brackett called it a âpretty lame deal all-in-allâ, while my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Liam Denning said the merger sounds a âdistinct sad-trombone note.âÂ Carrizo helps Callon double down on the Delaware Basin with contiguous acreage and lets it add free cash flow on the cheap, but it also dilutes its status as a pure-play operator by adding acreage the Eagle Ford region, where it may be harder to find cost savings. Some investors may have viewed Callon as a target and are disappointed to see it on the other end of aÂ deal. The consolidation of shale players is healthy and necessary, Liam writes. But the fact that Carrizo has chosen to sell at a modest premium when its stock was trading at the lowest levels in a decade is pretty telling, too.CRH Plc agreed to sell its European plumbing and heating-distribution business to BlackstoneÂ for 1.64 billion euros ($1.9 billion). CEO Albert Manifold has been trying to steer the company toward higher growth markets including cement and raise money for acquisitions. This deal helps it do both. Davy analyst Robert Gardiner says the purchase price is attractive at about 16 times earnings before interest and taxes.BONUS READING Saturday Will Be Hot.

2019-07-18	2019-07-18 19:37:58	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	5 Top Stock Trades for Friday: IBM, HON, PM, MS, BAC	The stock market again took a break from its robust rally as it digests more earnings results. We've seen plenty of mixed results, but so far, the market is handling the news pretty well. Here are a few top stock trades to watch going into the last trading day of the week.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: IBM  Click to EnlargeInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) started off lower on the day, but climbed more than 4.5% later in the day after reporting its earnings results.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast week, IBM stock pushed over downtrend resistance (blue line) and this week's move cements it. That prior downtrend mark is now a must-hold level for investors. I would love to see IBM stock stay above the trio of candlesticks that marked the weekly closing highs for the past 52 weeks. That's the black line that comes into play near $146.   If it holds, shares could run into the mid- to high-$150s and possibly challenge the 2018 highs. Below the ~$146 mark and we'll need to see if the 10-week moving average holds as support.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Honeywell  Click to EnlargeLook at the beautiful &quot;inside day&quot; Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is printing after reporting its quarterly results and raising guidance. An inside day occurs when the entire range of the second day is &quot;inside&quot; the range of the prior trading session.Of course, this one is even more interesting as HON stock initially lost, then reclaimed the 50-day on Thursday, but couldn't get above the 21-day moving average. Hmm. This sets up a range trade.Below Wednesday's lows and HON is likely heading lower. Above Wednesday's highs -- remember, that's the prior session -- and HON is likely heading higher. At least, until it runs into potential downtrend resistance (blue line).  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Philip Morris  Click to EnlargePhilip Morris (NYSE:PM) stock erupted 9% after better-than-expected earnings results. The move on the weekly chart thrust the stock above a key downtrend level, as well as the $87 mark. As long as PM holds above $87, bulls can justify a long position. Below it and we'll need to see the 200-week moving average hold as support. On the upside, let's see if PM can push through Thursday's highs and $90.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Morgan Stanley  Click to EnlargeMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) caught a slight lift after reporting second-quarter earnings. The stock continues to put in a series of higher lows and is maintaining above all of its major moving averages. However, it's having trouble pushing through resistance between $44 and $45. Like most major bank stocks, resistance continues to keep these names in check. Over $45 and a move to $46.50 is possible. Above that and $49 is doable. On a pullback, see that $43 holds as support. Below is concerning.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Bank of America  Click to EnlargeAnother example of a bank stock struggling to breakout? Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).The stock flirted with a breakout over $29.50 on Wednesday after beating on earnings expectations. However, the stock gave up most of its gains going into the close before holding short-term support at $29. BAC stock is stuck in a very tight range between $29 and $29.50. However, it's got plenty of bullish catalysts working in its favor, including earnings growth, revenue growth and a continually rising dividend and buyback. Its valuation continues to drop, too.   * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now If it can push through $29.50, it could trigger a breakout, first to $30 and possibly up toward $30.75. A move below the 21-day moving average and $29 is concerning.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-07-18	2019-07-18 13:33:05	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Honeywell Does Little to Alleviate Unease	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Even investor darling Honeywell International Inc. isnât immune to the slowdown taking place inÂ manufacturing.The maker of jet engines and air-conditioner controls reported second-quarter earnings on ThursdayÂ that beat analystsâ estimates, but sales in the period were weaker than expected, both including and excluding the impact of M&A and currency swings. The 5% organic revenueÂ growth Honeywell notched in the second quarter was a step down from both the year-earlier period and the aggressive 8% pace set in the first quarter. While the company raised its 2019 organic sales growth target to a range of 4% from 6%,Â its third-quarter forecast for 2% to 4% expansion was weaker than RBC analyst Deane Dray had been expecting.Â An increased full-year earnings outlook was also less robust than analysts had been anticipating.Donât get me wrong: this was still a very strong earnings performance from Honeywell. The companyâs aerospace division remains a standout, with 11% organic growth in the period. Notably, Honeywell had double-digit growth in new equipment for business jets. Thatâs an interesting contrast to the weak aviation revenue and $100 million slide in backlog at Textron Inc. in the second quarter, which the company blamed on business-jet customers becoming jittery about macroeconomic conditions. And Honeywell does have a habit of under-promising on guidance so that it can over-deliver down the road.But this feels different than merely keeping the bar low and beatable. There's good reason to be cautious in this environment.Â Honeywell cited uncertainty in markets with shorter sales cycles, inventory pile-ups in some sectors and macro-economic concerns including tariffs and Brexit, and itÂ appears to already be digging around in its toolkit for ways to weather a downturn. Concerns that cooling demand is becoming more marked than investors had appreciated took on a new gravity this week afterÂ East Coast railroad CSX Corp. reversed its call for sales growth this year and predicted as much as a 2% decline instead. HoneywellâsÂ showing wasnât nearly strong enoughÂ to buck the general feeling of unease.In other earnings news, Dover Corp. also reported second-quarter results on Thursday and followed a pattern similar to Honeywell: earnings per share beat analystsâ estimates and the company raised its full-year guidance, but overall sales in the period were a disappointment and Dover left its revenueÂ outlook unchanged. Â This pattern of earnings beat/sales miss adds some early credence to industrial companiesâ contention that years of cost-cuts and spin-offs have put them in a better position to weather an economic downturn. Dover last year spun off its Apergy Corp. energy business, while Honeywell carved its turbochargers and consumer-facing home technologies businesses into separate companies. In its earnings presentation, Honeywell said its relatively unburdened balance sheet and improved access to overseas cash after the U.S. tax overhaul give it other levers it can pull should a slowdown materialize. In other words, itâs waving the white flag of share buybacks.Iâm not entirely convinced that all these breakups have made industrial companies recession-proof. Yes, theyâve become less cyclical, but that has risks as well. Either way, without sales, you canât have profit. Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch has warned margin deterioration could be an underappreciated risk in the event of a mild industrial downturn. The severity of the 2008 financial crisis meant that few companies cut their prices because there was such low demand it wouldnât have made much of a difference, he writes. But in a more moderate slowdown, industrial companies are more apt to use price cuts to drive sales, undermining their margins in the process. Â Honeywell is still likely one of the safest places for investors to ride out a slowdown. But before the gloomy CSXÂ report dragged down the whole industrial sector, Honeywell was enjoying its best start to the year since 2007. The run-up in its shares leaves the company priced for perfection â and investors priced for disappointment should that perfection prove out of reach.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

Honeywell's stock rises after earnings beat and upbeat guidance, while sales fell shy	Shares of Honeywell International Inc.  rose 0.8% in premarket trading Thursday after the industrial conglomerate reported a second-quarter profit that topped expectations while sales fell shy, and lifted the low end of its full-year guidance ranges. Net income rose to $1.56 billion, or $2.10 a share, from $1.28 billion, or $1.68 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share rose to $2.10 from $1.93, above the FactSet consensus of $2.08. Sales fell 15% to $9.24 billion, citing the impact of spinoffs, and missed the FactSet consensus of $9.35 billion, as aerospace sales fell less than expected, building technologies and performance materials and technologies sales were roughly in line with expectations and safety and productivity solutions sales fell more than expected. For 2019, Honeywell lifted the low end of its guidance ranges for EPS to $7.95 to $8.15 from $7.90 to $8.15, for sales to $36.7 billion to $37.2 billion from $36.5 billion to $37.2 billion and for adjusted free cash flow to $5.7 billion to $6.0 billion from $5.5 billion to $6.0 billion. The stock has rallied 27.6% year to date through Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 16.7%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/257d7bd7-74eb-3ef8-a3e0-b2aabb3ccc8b/honeywell%26%2339%3Bs-stock-rises.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-12	2019-07-12 14:51:46	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	GE Stock Is Making the Right Moves to Build Investor Confidence	General Electric (NYSE:GE) shareholders have so far had a good year in 2019. Year-to-date, GE stock is up over 34%.Source: Shutterstock Most of the yearly gains came in the first two months of the year as investors seemed to believe that management would be able to create shareholder value in the long run.Between March and so far in July, GE stock has been trading in a range. Therefore investors are now wondering whether the bulls or the bears will have the upper hand in Q3.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGE stock is expected to report earnings on July 31. Let us take a look at what may be in store for General Electric stock as we approach the earnings season.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond  GE's Q1 Earnings and Long-Term CatalystsOn April 30, General Electric reported Q1 2019 earnings, when the group beat earnings and revenue forecasts on orders up 9%. EPS came at 14 cents vs. expected 9 cents a share.At present, the company reports revenue in six business segments: Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, Oil and Gas, Healthcare, and Capital.General Electric's Aviation, Oil & Gas, and Healthcare businesses delivered steady revenue and earnings growth.GE Aviation business, which is the company's largest segment by revenue, primarily builds and services aircraft engines. Earlier in June, Wall Street welcomed the news that the conglomerate signed lucrative contracts at the Paris Air Show.The segment took significant orders for LEAP engines as well as long-term service agreements (LTSAs). Wall Street pay close importance to service agreements as over close to half of the revenues come from from after-market services.Our readers may be interested to know that several analysts believe that the GE Aviation, which serves both commercial and military aircraft markets, may be worth about $100 billion when GE's own market cap is only 89 billion. Therefore, long-term investors may want to pay attention to the growth trajectory of the Aviation segment.The Oil & Gas Division, which is a cyclical business, has now returned to profitability.In Healthcare, GE has robust exposure to the hospital and lab equipment market. Several analysts see the possibility of an IPO for Healthcare.Within a few quarters, the company is aiming to have a much smaller GE Capital operation.  The unit reduced its liabilities as it completed $1.1 billion in asset reductions in the quarter.GE's industrial free cash flow is a key metric for many analysts and shareholders.  For the quarter, it showed a loss of $1.2 billion. Shareholders cheered General Electric in general, but especially the Power segment, burned less cash than feared. A Year in Progress for GE StockIn March, CEO Larry Culp called 2019 a &quot;reset year&quot; and urged patience during what has been portrayed as a multiyear turnaround. Following a rotation of CEOs, Culp took over from John Flannery in October. And has had a busy nine months so far.Under new leadership, General Electric has been taking several strategic steps to slim the group down to a few core units and raise cash by divesting from several businesses that no longer serve the group.These moves to clean up the balance sheet include the recent sales of the biopharma segment of the company's healthcare operation to Danaher (NYSE:DHR), a smaller industrial player, for $21 billion and the merger of its transportation business with Wabtec (NYSE:WAB).As a side note, before joining GE,  Culp had successfully headed and turned around Danaher, so industry watchers were generally supportive of the sale of the biopharma operation to the group.It has recently been reported that management would also like to sell GE Ventures, a diverse collection of over 100 startup companies.Long-term GE investors know that its Power division has had significant problems an sharp revenue declines in recent years. GE's core power product is the gas turbine.Wall Street is expecting the company to break up the Power segment in the coming quarters, a move that may benefit the GE share price.In other words through asset sales and spinoffs, GE is aiming to generate enough cash to reduce its $121 billion debt load and become more manageable.Last year, Culp took over a company with significant debt and unfunded pension liabilities and investors are understandably still nervous.Yet, overall, Wall Street approves the directional shift which seems to put the company on a stronger ground. And investors are reacting positively to these strategic moves that Culp has been taking.Turnarounds in industrial giants such as General Electric take a long time and never occur in a straight path. In the next earnings report, GE investors are likely to pay attention to improvements in individual segment margins and free cash flow trends. The GE Stock Price NowMany long-term shareholders know that General Electric stock price is a shadow of its former self. Let us go a bit back in history.In August 2000, GE stock hit an all-time high of $60.75. In October 2007, it was hovering around $40. By March 2009, at the heights of the great recession, General Electric's risky balance had sheet pushed the shares down to $5.73.In 2016, GE stock saw a decade-high of $33. But troubles for the General Electric share price began once again with 2017. Losses in the GE Capital unit and plummeting sales and profitability in General Electric's Power business put pressure on the stock.The market decline of 2018 pushed the shares once again to the single digits and in December of last year, the price saw a decade-low of $6.66.As of this writing, GE stock is hovering around $10.2. So Should Long-Term Investors Buy GE Stock?After years of continuous price volatility and decline, it is still proving hard for GE to regain investor trust for the long term.If you follow technical analysis, the long-term GE stock chart has been improving. In other words, bears are not in control of the stock price at this point as the worst has likely already been priced into General Electric stock.From a longer-term technical analysis perspective, I'd expect the stock to move up another 15-20% from the current levels within a year. Shorter-term, the stock will possibly continue to trade in a range, hovering around $10.I am also encouraged by the fact that GE stock's current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is over 0.73x. Companies generate revenue from the sale of goods and services.  Analysts prefer a low P/S ratio, ideally below 1. However, a P/S number between 1 and 2 is more common. To put the metric into perspective, S&P 500's average price-to-sales ratio is 2.1x.Another way to analyze the P/S ratio is to compare companies in similar industries or segments. Our readers may be interested to know that the P/S ratio for Boeing (NYSE:BA) is 2x. For Honeywell (NYSE:HON) stock, the P/S ratio stands at 3.2x. And for 3M (NYSE:MMM) the P/S is almost 4x.Investors who do not yet have a position may want to wait until GE's earnings report in late July to have a better view on the developments within individual segments. Analysts will pay special attention to the sales figures in different units as well as the level of free cash flow.Those investors who already own GE shares, may either consider taking some money off the table or hedging their positions. As for hedging strategies, covered calls or put spreads with Aug. 16 expiry could be appropriate as straight put purchases are likely to be expensive due to heightened volatility. Then, you may reevaluate your long position after General Electric reports earnings. The Bottom Line on GE StockOver the past few months, the narrative for General Electric stock has changed for the better and GE is not making regular negative headlines any more.I believe that many long-term investors are ready to give GE management, which has started dealing with the pressing issues, the benefit of the doubt. Therefore, I'd see any dip in GE stock price an opportunity to go long.The author has GE covered calls (July 12 expiry).

Shares of the electric carmaker were up nearly 4% on the heels of news it was planning to ramp-up production at its Fremont, California plant. Memory chip maker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) was up 4% as well after the glut-beleaguered company announced it raised a few billion by issuing some well-received notes.At the other end of the spectrum, Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) tumbled 12% after the jeans company said the second half of the year wasn't looking quite as promising as first believed.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best ETFs for 2019: The Race for 1 Intensifies None of those picks are great prospects headed into Thursday's session though. Rather, it's the stock charts of Davita (NYSE:DVA), Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) that look like your best bets, even if not all for bullish reasons. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Advanced Micro Devices shares, in simplest terms, are at an inflection point. Although the rally since late last year has been persistent and rewarding, for the second time in a month AMD is knocking on the doors of record highs. If the bulls fail once again, this third try may not set up a fourth attempt anytime soon. Rather, this could serve as the pivot into a more prolonged downtrend, and the backdrop is anything but encouraging.  Click to Enlarge  * The ceiling in question is right around $34, plotted in white on both stock charts. This is the third time since mid-2018 it has been tested.  * While the advance appears to have momentum, there's a stark lack of volume behind the gain thus far.  * A breakout move past the $34 area could be catalytic, but if volume doesn't materialize in a big way, it could also be nothing but a setup for an even bigger wave of profit-taking. Davita (DVA)In a perfect world a stock's trading action would always make sense, and moves -- higher or lower -- wouldn't need prodding. We don't live or trade in a perfect world though.With that as the backdrop (and perhaps with a bit of irony thrown in), this week's drubbing of Davita shares may be the very thing they needed to restart a bigger-picture rally effort that ultimately failed to follow through last week. It was news that prompted the shakeup, which isn't ideal. It's still the hand traders were dealt though.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown   Click to Enlarge  * As of last Friday, DVA had just pushed above its 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. On Monday, that move was completely up-ended, by headlines.  * Tuesday's miserable opening wasn't so miserable after all. With some help from the purple 50-day moving average and even more held with a semi-established floor around $50.76, Davita logged a convincing intraday reversal pattern.  * Wednesday's follow-through was key, and on above-average volume to boot. Honeywell International (HON)Finally, it's far from being in deep trouble yet, but Honeywell International shares are slowly moving in that direction. It's the pace and nature of the slowdown, in fact, that's raising so many red flags.Either, with a runup that has far outpaced the broad market's gain since the very end of last year, the sheer risk of the rollover turning into something more merits a closer look.  Click to Enlarge  * It's loosely evident on both stock charts, put the daily chart's purple 50-day moving average line's flattening action best shows the gradual slowdown underway.  * The clincher here would be a MACD crossunder on the weekly chart. Such signals have accurately marked sizable pullbacks a couple of times since early 2018.  * It may have more to do with the season than the stock, but there's been minimal volume behind the worst of the bearish days that have started this slow, arching rollover.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-10	2019-07-10 13:39:00	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Banned ChineseÂ SecurityÂ Cameras Are Almost Impossible to Remove	(Bloomberg) -- U.S. federal agencies have five weeks to rip out Chinese-made surveillance cameras in order to comply withÂ a banÂ imposed by Congress last yearÂ in an effort to thwart the threat of spying from Beijing.But thousands of theÂ devices are still in place and chances are mostÂ wonât be removed before the Aug. 13Â deadline.Â A complex web of supply chain logistics and licensing agreements make it almost impossible to know whether a security camera is actually made in China or contains components that would violate U.S. rules.Â The National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which outlines the budget and spending for the Defense Department each year, included an amendmentÂ for fiscal 2019 that would ensure federal agencies do not purchase Chinese-made surveillance cameras. The amendment singles outÂ Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. and Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., both of which have raised security concerns with the U.S. government and surveillance industry.Hikvision is 42% controlled by the Chinese government.Â Dahua, in 2017, was foundÂ by cybersecurity company ReFirm Labs to have cameras withÂ covert back doors that allowed unauthorized people to tap into them andÂ send information to China. DahuaÂ said at the time that it fixed the issue and published a public notice about the vulnerability. The U.S. government is considering imposing further restrictions by banningÂ both companies from purchasing American technology, people familiar with the matter said in May.Â âVideo surveillance and security equipment sold by Chinese companies exposes the U.S. government to significant vulnerabilities,â said Representative Vicky Hartzler, a Republican fromÂ Missouri, who helpedÂ draftÂ the amendment.Â Removing the cameras will âensure that China cannot create a video surveillance network within federal agencies,â she said at the time.Dahua declined to comment on the ban. In a company statement, Hikvision said it complies with all applicable laws and regulations and has made efforts to ensure its products are secure. A company spokesman added that the Chinese government is not involved in the day-to-day operations of Hikvision.Â &quot;The company is independent in business, management, assets, organization and finance from its controlling shareholders,&quot; the spokesman said.Despite the looming deadline to satisfy the NDAA, at least 1,700 Hikvision and Dahua cameras are still operating in places where theyâve been banned,Â according to San Jose, California-basedÂ Forescout Technologies, which has been hired by some federal agencies to determine what systems are running on their networks. The actualÂ number is likely much higher, said Katherine Gronberg, vice presidentÂ of government affairs at Forescout, because only a small percentage of government offices actually know what cameras theyâre operating.Â The agencies that use software to track devices connected to their networksÂ should be able to comply with the law and remove the cameras in time, Gronberg said. âThe real issue is for organizations that donât have the tools in place to detect the banned devices,â she added.Â SeveralÂ years ago the Department of Homeland Security tried to force all federal agencies to secure their networksÂ by tracking every connected device. As of December, only 35%Â ofÂ required agencies had fully complied with this mandate, according to a 2018 report by the Government Accountability Office.Â As a result, mostÂ U.S. federal agencies still donât know how manyÂ or whatÂ type of devices are connected to their networks and are now leftÂ trying to identify the cameras manually, one by one.Â Those charged with complying with the banÂ have discovered itâs much more complicated than just switching off all Hikvision or Dahua-labeled cameras. Not only can Chinese cameras come with U.S. labels, but many of the devices, including those made by Hikvision,Â are likely to contain parts from Huawei Technologies Co., the target of a broad government crackdown and whose chips power about 60% of surveillance cameras.Â âThere areÂ all kinds of shadowy licensing agreements that prevent us from knowing the true scope of Chinaâs foothold in this market,â said Peter Kusnic, aÂ technology writer atÂ business research firmÂ The Freedonia Group.Â âIâm not sure it will even be possible to ever fully identify all of these cameras, let alone remove them. The sheer number is insurmountable.âÂ Video surveillance is big business in the U.S. Sales ofÂ video cameras to theÂ government areÂ projected to climb to $705 million in 2021 from $570 million in 2016,Â according to The Freedonia Group.Â HikvisionÂ is the worldâs largest video-surveillance provider, withÂ cameras installed in U.S. businesses, banks, airports, schools, Army bases and government offices. Its cameras can produce sharp, full-color images in fog and near-total darkness and use artificial intelligence andÂ 3D imaging to powerÂ facial recognition systems on a vast scale.Once they arrive in the country, some of Dahua and Hikvisionâs cameras are sent to their U.S.-basedÂ warehouses. Others go to equipment manufacturersÂ like Panasonic Corp. or Honeywell International Inc., and are sold under those brands, said John Honovich, founder of video surveillance site IPVM. Then the cameras are bought by intermediaries, such as security firms, which go on to sell them to government agencies and private businesses.Â The NDAAÂ also covers Dahua and Hikvisionâs extensive agreements with original equipment manufacturers, sweeping up any vendor who re-sells the devices or uses the companiesâÂ equipment.Effectively,Â  two cameras running identical Hikvision firmware could carryÂ completely different labels and packaging. This means it would be nearlyÂ impossible to tell if the thousands of video cameras installed across the country areÂ actually re-labelled Chinese devices. A Honeywell spokeswoman said the companyÂ couldnât track these re-labelled products, even if asked. Panasonic didnât respond to emailed requests for comment.This convoluted supply chain has leftÂ government agencies confused over how to actually obeyÂ the law.Â âWeâve been trying to get our arms around how big the problem is,â says a government worker at the Department of Energy, who asked to remain anonymous because heâs not authorized to speak publicly. âI donât think we have the full picture on how many of these cameras are really out there,â he said.The law itself is vague on whether it means agencies must remove the cameras or simply stop renewing existing contracts. A group ofÂ government officials and experts will meet next week in Washington to try to parse the legislation.Â Hikvision has aboutÂ 50,000 installation companies and integrated partners that are all wondering how broadly the lawÂ is likely to be interpreted.Many have contacted the company, asking how they could be affected,Â according to a person familiar with the discussions.Â Some security vendors are already refusing to purchase equipment from Hikvision and Dahua. Shares of both companies have tumbled since March amid speculation of U.S. sanctions. Last month U.S. President Donald Trump said he would allow U.S. companies to resume supplying some of their products to Huawei, if they apply for a license and ifÂ there is no threat to national security.If someone is routinely tapping intoÂ cameras to spy on federal agencies, they could easily determine the identities of those who work in government departments and even CIA operatives, said Stephen Bryen, former deputy under-secretary of defense for trade security policy. âThis is extremely dangerous,â he said. âIt canât be tolerated and quite frankly every agency should be writing its own directives to make sure the job gets done.â(Updates with Trump policy on granting licenses to Huawei suppliers.Â  An earlier version of this story corrected the location of Forescout Technologies.)To contact the author of this story: Olivia Carville in New York at ocarville1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Molly Schuetz at mschuetz9@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/banned-chinese-security-cameras-almost-090043247.html?.tsrc=rss

And profit growth could see industrial stocks continue to outperform the broader market.&quot;We're living in a world where growth is declining,&quot; John Davi, chief investment officer at Astoria Portfolio Advisors, told CNBC back in March. &quot;S&P; 500 earnings are de-accelerating, so if you can get stocks that have above-average growth to the S&P;, then that's really attractive.&quot; And while consensus estimates have been scaled back since then, FactSet's Earnings Insight still shows that industrials are expected to grow profits 5.2% this calendar year - better than the 3.2% projected for the S&P; 500.The sector still faces headline risk, so you only want to buy the best of the best. To help with that, we've pinpointed 10 of the Street's best-rated industrials by using TipRanks' Stock Screener to scan only for companies in the industrial sector with a &quot;Strong Buy&quot; analyst consensus.

2019-06-28	2019-06-28 14:08:58	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Is It Finally Time to Go Long GE Stock?	General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock has had a stunning fall from grace. Viewed as an American industrial titan for decades, the company has undergone a miraculous deterioration. Three years ago, GE stock was trading north of $30. In December 2018 it was flirting with falling below $6. Now back above $10, GE stock is showing signs of life. Does that make it a buy?Source: Shutterstock From a fundamental perspective, the answer seems like a resounding &quot;no.&quot; From a technical point of view, though, GE stock is looking much healthier. But just because its charts are pointing to potential gains doesn't mean its balance sheet issues have been resolved or that its cash flow woes have vanished  * The 7 Top Small-Cap Stocks Of 2019  The Growling BearJPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa called the demise of GE stock. He was the first analyst to turn bearish on the industrial conglomerate and, for the most part, he's stuck to his guns. As GE stock fell last year, Tusa was ahead of the ball. He would lower his price target or issue negative reports only to see the stock price get nailed weeks or months later on continued weak fundamentals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTusa told investors to stop selling GE stock in December. Well, sort of.He raised his &quot;sell&quot; rating on General Electric stock to a &quot;hold&quot; rating, but maintained his $6 price target. The shares bottomed near $6.60 and embarked on a violent upside reversal. Investors -- or at least momentum traders -- used Tusa's upgrade as an opportunity to squeeze GE stock higher.I don't mean to put too much weight on one analyst. But it got to the point that investors were using Tusa's statements, rather than those of GE's management, to determine how the company was really doing.Tusa downgraded GE stock again a few months ago. He now has  a &quot;sell&quot; rating and a Street-low $5 price target on General Electric stock. While many of his peers and management are cheering the company's &quot;conservative&quot; $55 billion of new aviation orders from the Paris Aviation Show, Tusa said the takeaway for GE &quot;was on net more negative than even we were thinking when it comes to the Aviation debate.&quot; Valuing General Electric StockGiven the bullish price action of GE stock since December, it's no wonder Tusa's bearish stance has drawn some criticism. And that's where there's a diversion between GE's fundamentals and the technicals of GE stock.Fundamentally, it's hard to make a case for being long General Electric stock. But as you'll see in a moment on the charts, the stock continues to get healthier.Management already told us that the company's cash flows would be pressured for the rest of this year and be weak next year as well. For a company like GE, that's not good news. The company has already essentially slashed its dividend down to nothing and has had to part ways with assets at less-than-favorable prices.Analysts' expectations for the company aren't great, either.Analysts, on average, are calling for earnings of 59 cents per share this year, a near-10% decline from last year's 65 cents per share. The consensus estimate for 2020 calls for earnings of 74 cents per share. If attained, that represents growth of 25% from 2019. However, it's still lower than the 76 cents of basic EPS that GE had in 2016.Its revenue is expected to decline 3.8% this year to about $117 billion and rebound just 1.3% in 2020 to $118.5 billion. But its 2020 top line, like its 2020 bottom line,  is expected to be lower in 2020 than it was in 2018. Moreover, in 2016 the company generated revenue of $119.4 billion.In short, GE  has been bleeding like crazy. General Electric stock has been rallying because investors are banking that management can stop the bleeding. If it can't, Tusa's price target may pan out. If it can, the shares will probably be able to climb over time.Compared to a company like Honeywell (NYSE:HON) or a high-dividend stock like 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) though, it's hard to find GE stock attractive. Trading GE Stock  Click to EnlargeNot long ago, I pointed out that GE stock could rebound. My statement came as the shares were knocking on the door to $10.50, which has been range resistance throughout 2019. The stock broke through and ran to $10.71, but then retreated.At the time, I said that, if its breakout failed,  GE needed to use its major moving averages as its support. GE is now using its 20-day moving average as support. If GE stock stays above the 20-day moving average , a retest of the $10.50 resistance point should be in the cards.GE still has plenty of support below the 20-day. The now-uptrending 50-day moving average is $9.92, while the 200-day moving average is  $9.61. Just above that is prior downtrend resistance (depicted by the blue line). Below all that, GE stock has range support at $9.The bottom line? See if GE gets another opportunity to break out over $10.50.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-06-21	2019-06-21 19:00:16	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Paris Air Show Lands on an Optimistic Note	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Clouds of worry have been gathering over the commercial aviation industry, but the sun was shining in Paris this week as planemakers and suppliers gathered for the biennial Air Show.I mean that both literally â it was hot â and figuratively, with every executive I talked to adopting the same tone of cautious optimism. They conceded the market is slowing: Amid sputtering air traffic growth, weakening airline profits and a slowing global economy, orders at the Paris Air Show trailed the tally from last yearâs Farnborough Air Show on both a unit and dollar basis, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligenceâs George Ferguson and Francois Duflot. And the orders that were announced werenât always written in stone. Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard counted about 610 commitments for new planes between Boeing Co. and Airbus SE (short of his forecast for 800),Â but only about 160 of those areÂ firm orders for large aircraft and all of those belong to Airbus.(1) Some orders for Airbusâs new A321XLRÂ â a longer-range version of its top-selling narrow-bodyÂ jet that was unveiled as expected this week â were converted from existing commitments for previous A320-family models. But there were orders, including a surprise bid from British Airways parent IAG SA for Boeingâs embattled 737 Max jets (more on that later). While everyone no doubt would have preferred a stronger showing, no one was panicking, either.Global growth in demand for commercial aviation is likely to slow to a pace of about 5% this yearÂ from around 7.5% to 8% in the past few years, according to the International Air Transport Association. âThatâs still a pretty good place to be â look at what many other industries are doing,â Tony Wood, CEO of aircraft braking and fire-protection equipment maker Meggitt Plc, said in an interview. âItâs certainly quicker than the world is growing.â Tim Mahoney, CEO of Honeywell International Inc.âs aerospace unit, pointed out that airlines are filling the capacity they lost when two fatal crashes prompted a global grounding of Boeingâs Max throughÂ leases and older aircraft that are staying in service longer than planned. Jet Airways India Ltd. suspended operations in April after running out of cash and is heading to bankruptcy court, but some of its fleet has already been reallocated, Mahoney said. âItâs a validation that the demand from the flying public is there and it continues to grow,â he said. Boeing, meanwhile, now expects the commercial aviation market to need 44,040 new jets and $9.1 trillion of services over the next 20 years. That compares with last yearâs prediction of 42,730 jets and $8.8 trillion of services.So, Boeing and Airbusâs backlogs are likely safe in their robustness for the time being. But as I said going into the show, the question is whether theyâve already saturated the market and whether those backlogs will continue to grow. Executives from CFM International, the engine joint venture between General Electric Co.Â and Safran SA, werenât super enthusiastic aboutÂ production rate increases for Airbusâs A320 family. Itâs not clear that the supply chain is capable of handling a more aggressive pace, particularly the forgingÂ and casting companies, which have been the primary source of delays over the past few years. At a media briefing on Saturday, CFM executives said they also want to be sure any production rate increase is sustainable and will serve the market over the long-term âÂ not just at its peak. The relative dearth of orders at this yearâs Air Show would seem to support their cautious stance.ALLâS FAIR IN LOVE AND THE MAXBoeingâs Air Show order tally fell about $10 billion short of Airbusâs haul, but IAGâs commitment to buyÂ 200 Max jets means more for the company than the final total. IAG CEO Willie Walsh, a former 737 pilot, said he would feel comfortable boarding a Max tomorrow. He canât actually do that because the planes remain grounded globally, but it was a huge vote of confidence when Boeing needed one desperately. That kind of endorsement most likely didnât come cheap: the list price for theÂ planes IAG intends to buy is $24 billion, but the true price is likely much lower after adjusting for standard discounts and probably a few extra incentives. Itâs not a done deal just yet. IAG only signed a letter of intent, which gives it an out in case the Max runs into more problems or if Airbus comes up with a better offer. Airbus sales chief Christian Scherer said his company was never invited to bid on the dealÂ but would very much like to. Either way, IAGâs willingness to back the Max gets Boeing out of the aviation industryâs version of timeout. This was always inevitable. Customers have been resolute in their confidence that Boeing will make the fuel-efficient Max safe to fly again. IAG had previously relied largely on Airbus models for its shorter hauls, so the fact that itâs the one stepping up with a Max order is a testament to airlinesâ desire to maintain competition between the two companies. But I do wonder whether that kind of dynamic properly incentivizes Boeing to address theÂ transparency,Â communicationÂ and oversight issues that allowed the Maxâs shortcomings to morph into a full-blown crisis. Meanwhile, a good chunk of Airbusâs orders were for the freshly rolled-out XLR, with American Airlines Group Inc. agreeing to buy 20 of the planes and convert existingÂ orders into 30 more. Boeingâs sales chiefÂ Ihssane Mounir said in a closing press conference that the XLR addressed only a âsliverâ of the middle market and that thereâs still an untapped opportunity for a rival offeringÂ itâs contemplating. That was backed up by comments from the CEOs of JetBlue Airways Corp. (which ordered 13 XLRs) and Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (which is thinking about buying the Airbus jet), with bothÂ advocatingÂ for the range advantages of a possible Boeing new middle-market aircraft. But while Boeing CEOÂ Dennis Muilenburg said there was no planÂ to accelerate the development of aÂ successor to the 737 model, the Max crisis and advances in manufacturing and engine technology may force it to give that kind of project precedence over aÂ middle-market jet.Â MEGADEAL SHOWCASEFor all theÂ optimism about continuing growth, I thought it was interesting that Raytheon Co.âs CEO Tom Kennedy and CFO Toby OâBrien chose to castÂ their companyâs merger with United Technologies Corp. as a bet on the long-term value of resiliency. Eventually, the booming growth the aerospace and defense sector haveÂ enjoyed simultaneously the past few years is going to come to an end; itâs rare that the two sectors move in tandem. Revenue for the combined United Technologies-Raytheon will split nearly equally between commercial and defense products and between domestic and international markets. âWe didnât have to do this,â OâBrien said. But the combination âmakes for a really resilient company through all cycles. If youâre in it for the long haul, why wouldnât you want that?â Kennedy said heâs not concerned about a slowdown in defense spending in the near-term, given governmentsâ continuing concerns about geopolitical turmoil. He pointed to backing from both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate for more increases in the Defense Departmentâs budget for research, development, test and evaluation. The deal with United Technologies will help Raytheon compete more aggressively for the next generation of military franchises by giving it new technological capabilities, Kennedy and OâBrien said. The potential for advancements in compact, high-energy power generation, thermal management and hypersonics is intriguing, and the combined companyâs $8 billion annual R&D budget will give it an exorbitant amount of money to play with. But revenue synergies are notoriously more fungible than cold hard cost cuts. So the companiesâ willingness to share about half of the $1 billion-plus in annual cost savings theyâre targeting with the U.S. government may prove the bigger competitive advantage.The synergies number struck analysts as quite low at only about 1% of the combined companyâs $74 billion in sales. OâBrien acknowledged the figure is conservativeÂ but said the deal wasÂ light on integration work because the Raytheon businesses will continue largelyÂ as their own unitsÂ rather than having their contents strewn about between existing United Technologies operations. While that limits the cost savings, it also makes it harder for United Technologies to foul up the deal as it juggles the Raytheon purchase with the continuingÂ integration of Rockwell Collins Inc. and a pending three-way split. With plenty of time and opportunity for something to go wrong here, United Technologiesâ wager on scale is relatively untested and GE and Honeywell arenât so sure that a bigger aerospace and defense company is necessarily going to be a better one. Both argue they have technology advantages that will keep them competitive. But GE again made interesting noises about possible M&A, with aviation head David Joyce noting that he didnât feel compelled to act by the United Technologies-Raytheon tie-up but âwouldnât rule out anything.â Â SOMETHING TO PROVEWith the United Technologies-Raytheon merger looming large and questions mounting about cash flow for GEâs aviation unit, Joyce used the Paris Air Show to strike back at critics. GE Aviation and its CFM engine joint ventureÂ tallied $55 billion orders for engines and services at the event. Not all of that was technically new, but the haul was anchored by a legitimatelyÂ impressive $20 billion order for Leap engines and services from Indian budget carrier IndiGo, which had previously relied exclusively on United Technologies jet engines to power its Airbus A320neo fleet. Joyce also laid out the most in-depth road map for a unitâs free cash flow that Iâve ever seen GE provide. But in what has become an unfortunate pattern for GE, what was probably a well-intentionedÂ attempt at transparency sparked only more questions. Analysts continued to pick apart whether the aviation unitâs $4.2 billion in free cash flow last year reflects the full tax, pension and overhead cost burden it would bear if the business were to stand alone. While GE hasnât voiced any plans to spin off the aviation unit âÂ  and Iâm highly doubtful it would be able to do that given continuingÂ challenges in the power and long-term care insurance operations âÂ many investors rely on a sum-of-the-parts analysis to determine the stockâs appropriate valuation. So the legitimacy of that $4.2 billion number as the basis for an independent aviation unit is at the crux of the debate over where the share price goes from here. After walking through the numbers with GE, I feel more comfortable about how they arrived at the $4.2 billion number. But no one knows for sure how all the numbers would shake out if aviation was ever detached from the mothership and the financial benefits inherent in that structure. United Technologies is taking about 18 months to split itself into three parts, and its structure is arguably less difficult to untangle.Â  So I donât think this debate is going away.QUICK NOTE ON GECASGEâs jet-lessor arm announced a deal to lease 15 additional Boeing 737-800 converted cargo aircraft to Amazon.com Inc., expanding on an earlier agreement to provide the retail giant with five planes. Amazon aims to have 70 aircraft flying on its network by 2021 in just the latest reminder that its logistics aspirations are a real and growing threat to FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. In a presentation announcing the latest deal with Amazon, GECAS executives said it costs about $8 million to convert a Boeing 737-800Â into a cargo plane. In a separate conversation, Sarah Rhoads, the director of Amazon Air, said the company put out requests for proposals to other lessors and that its ultimate choice had to be cost-effective. She said she felt good about partnering with GECAS. In a meeting with analysts this week,Â Alec Burger, who heads GECAS,Â acknowledged that the forecast for the air-cargo market was flat in 2019 amid escalating trade tensions but said the continuing shift to online shopping will continue to support demand in the long term and heâs looking to âmodestly growâ the share of the lessorâs portfolio thatâs devoted to that market. He said Amazon is not a âmust-win account.âDEALS, ACTIVISTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCECrane Co. is following through on its threat to take its $45-a-share takeover offer directly to Circor International Inc.âs shareholders. Itâs rare to see a true hostile tender offer, so for the M&A nerd in me, this is exciting. Circorâs board said on Monday that it would review the offer and make a recommendation to shareholders within 10 business days. It had previously rebuffed Craneâs offer as opportunistic and said it undervalued the company, a point of view that some shareholders pushed back on, given the choppy âÂ and lately lower â stock price. Mario Gabelli, whose Gamco Investors Inc. is the largest shareholder of Circor, has also criticized the companyâs lack of transparency in disclosing Craneâs interest. We are still awaiting the release of a business plan that Circor promised would show a path to greater valuation creation, but Craneâs willingness to go hostile forces Circor into an even tighter corner. Â Delta Air Lines Inc.Â Â bought a 4.3% stake in Hanjin Kal Corp., the largest shareholder in Korean Air Lines Co. Delta and Korean Air have a trans-Pacific joint venture that allows the two carriers to coordinate on flights in Asia and the U.S. Delta expects to boost its stake to 10% over time.Â The stake purchase is the latest in a string of similar deals with other partners including Brazilâs Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SAÂ and China Eastern Airlines Corp. But the deal also puts Delta in the middle of an activist shareholderâs campaign to push Hanjin Kal to provide more transparency and improve corporate governance. Shares ofÂ Hanjin Kal, whose operations also span logistics services, plunged on news of Deltaâs investment in an apparent sign that investors see the companyâs stake as a roadblock to the activistsâ goals. Â Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. appears to be moving forward with its interest in acquiring Bombardier Inc.âs CRJ regional jet program. A takeover âwould make a lot of sense,â Steve Haro, vice president in charge of global marketing and strategy at Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp., told Bloomberg News at the Paris Air Show. He said news about ânew strategic partnershipsâ would be forthcoming. Recall that Nikkei had reported earlier this month that Mitsubishi wanted to only carve out the aircraft maintenance network of the CRJ program, but Bombardier had insisted on the unit being sold in its entirety.BONUS READING New York Fed Factory Gauge Drops by Record to Two-Year LowÂ Siemens to Cut 2,700 Jobs at Energy Unit Due for Listing Fight for Survival on Doomed Jet Came Down to Two Cockpit Wheels Southwest Pilots to Seek Recovery of 737 Max Costs From Boeing Airbus Says It Must Slash A350 Costs to Win Wide-Body Price War Craft Breweries Are Booming Even as Americans Drink Less BeerIf youâd like to get these weekly industrial insights delivered to your inbox, please email me directly atÂ bsutherland7@bloomberg.net, and ask to join the list.

2019-06-17	2019-06-17 17:16:21	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	GE and Honeywell Stare Down a $74 Billion Monster	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- United Technologies Corp. CEO Greg Hayes dropped the bombshell news of his companyâs merger with missile-maker Raytheon Co. just days before the start of the Paris Air Show, therebyÂ ensuring rivals would have to answer questions about the dealÂ at the industryâs premier event. The deal will turn United Technologies into a $74 billion commercial aviation and defense powerhouse, with the kind of scale and negotiating leverage that was previously only enjoyed by Boeing Co. and Airbus SE. Management at General Electric Co. and Honeywell International Inc. donât seem in anyÂ rush to respond in kind, and theyÂ arenât so sure bigger is better. But the United Technologies-Raytheon merger is so big that it will be impossible for them to ignore it.âWeâve never really considered scale as a part of our strategy,â Tim Mahoney, CEO of Honeywell Aerospace, said in an interview at the Air Show on Monday. The company prioritizes differentiated products that are more than a âme-tooâ and believes that will ultimately give it an advantage with manufacturers and airlines, he said. GEâs David Joyce, who heads up the companyâs aerospace business,Â echoed that thought in a Bloomberg TV interview: âThat merger may have scale but we have the right technologies and engines to be competitive.âDuring a media briefing earlier in the day, Joyce touted the advantages of GEâs Leap engine over the rival geared turbofan from United Technologiesâ Pratt & Whitney arm, including what he says is a $1.4 million advantage in residual value and 6% better utilization.Â After the merger, GEâs biggest jet engine rivals will continue to be Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, and âI feel really good about our positioning relative to either of those competitors right now,â Joyce said. The âright nowâ part of that sentence seems key. No, GE isnât gaining a new competitor, but it is going to see a very different one.United Technologies and Raytheon are targeting $8 billion in annual R&D spending. GE Aviation spent $1.5 billion on R&D in 2018, including contributions from customers, according to its annual filing. That would put the aviation unitâs R&D spending at about 5% of sales. At the media briefing, Joyce said GE Aviation spends about 8% of its sales on R&D, which is based on $2.4 billion in total âengineeringâ spend. Either way, itâs less than the nearly 11% of United Technologies-Raytheonâs combined sales that will be devoted to investing in new products. Honeywell doesnât disclose R&D spending by division, but spent $1.8 billion on company-sponsored R&D across all its businesses in 2018, according to its 10K. Thatâs roughly 4.3 percent of its total sales last year.The dollar amount isnât everything. As GE itself knows far too well from its experience going down the rabbit hole on its Predix software platform, itâs quite easy to spend a lot of money without anything to show for it. And United Technologies will admittedly be distracted while it integrates not only Raytheon, but the $30 billion acquisition of avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc., which only just closed in November. Not to mention itâs also trying to break itself in three parts. The companyâs wager on scale is still highly untested and despite all the speculation about the sweeping consolidation its dealmaking might inspire, we havenât seen much of that. Of the eight aerospace and defense deals larger than $5 billion over the past decade, United Technologies (or Rockwell Collins) has been involved as a buyer in four of them; United TechnologiesÂ also sold its Sikorsky helicopter unit to Lockheed Martin Corp. for $9 billion in 2015. The party of bigger is better is pretty muchÂ a party of one â again, for now.Joyce interestingly said that while the United Technologies-Raytheon tie-up doesnât make him feel compelled to act, he âwouldnât rule out anythingâ when it comes to a deal with a good value proposition, and that he talks to CEO Larry Culp on a regular basis. That echoes increasingly frequent comments made by Culp about going on offense. I do wonder whether GE is thinking more seriously about dealmakingÂ â or if it just wants investors to think that it is. As for the much-debated possible combination of GE Aviation and Honeywell Aerospace, I donât get the impression the latter is that interested. Honeywell views acquisitions as a way to extend the capabilities of its businesses, rather than double down on more of the same, Mahoney said. He gives the example of Honeywellâs purchase of fuel-efficiency software maker Aviaso in 2015 for an undisclosed amount. Mahoney said he wished Aviaso was a larger business, which suggests heâs not opposed to bigger takeovers but only if the technology is really compelling.So donât hold your breath on that one. But could there be other deals? Check back at next yearâs Air Show in Farnborough.Â To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-06-13	2019-06-13 15:15:30	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	The Problem Is, GE Stock Is Just Unknowable Right Now	With all due respect to the analyst community, please stop handicapping General Electric (NYSE:GE) as if it's possible to know where the company will be a year from now. Likewise to investors, be wary of treating GE stock as if it reasonably compares to peers such as Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) or Danaher (NYSE:DHR).Source: Shutterstock GE is, more than anything else right now, an enigmaâ¦ an idea. Choosing not to acknowledge it as such could prove frustrating.That's not intended as an insult to parties on either side of the capital-markets table, to be clear. The aforementioned pitfalls are easy to stumble into; I've stumbled into both traps more than once myself.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10 But, as a guy who's been in the investing business for 20 years now (with the gray and thinning hair to prove it) I can say I've seen, heard, and done it all, most of it twice.That includes the current General Electric story and all of its nuances; same story, different name. And, the fact of the matter is, nobody has a clue General Electric is really going. They're all guessing. We're all guessing.There is one thing I am confident of though. That is, if GE stock can clear one key technical hurdle, all that rhetoric is going to turn bullish in a hurry, driving what could be a decent bullish swing trade that may well flag the long-awaited, bigger turnaround. A Closer Look at GEIt's not a reality too many in the financial media and investment-advice business care to concede, but sometimes, our best guesses still aren't all that good.It's a rarity, to be fair. People paid to pontificate tend to have a rather firm grip on things that are taking shape with the economy, the market and with individual companies.This isn't one of those times though. General Electric has thrown a lot of people for a loop.But, at least the professionals at this dance have to chime in with something on the company.Reality: The sale of General Electric's assets like its locomotive arm to WabTec (NYSE:WAB) and the rumored liquidation of its aviation finance arm are seemingly steps in the right direction. GE needs cash to shore up liquidity problems, and selling assets is the quickest way to raise liability-free cash. Bear in mind, however, the company is selling revenue-bearing and in many cases profit-driving assets.Some say there's more upside to paring itself down, but others are less convinced divestitures are the right move given the company's cash-flow challenges.Its Power arm is in trouble too. Let's not pretend like that's not at least partially the result of persistently tepid oil and gas prices though, admittedly underscored by a lack of product development.The former remains entirely out of the company's control, no matter how well General Electric regroups its power business from the inside.The biggest X factor of all though is the unknowable. Right now, there are simply an overwhelming number of unknowables muddling up a clear view of the company's fiscal strength.Perhaps more so than any other outfit seen in the modern market era, General Electric is a moving targetâ¦ multiple moving targets, in fact. Nobody really knows what lies ahead, even if their thesis seem rock-solid and well-polished. Looking Ahead for GE StockThat's not to suggest GE stock has to be avoided. Indeed, General Electric has the potential to be very rewarding for the right kind of trader.The key is simply understanding that the chart of GE stock right now is driving opinions of the stock as much as it's being driven by them.To that end, we're all lucky in the sense that investors have collectively, unconsciously drawn their line in the sand. It's $10.48, where GE stock has peaked a couple of times since March.It's working on another test of that technical ceiling right now, but is starting that effort with the benefit of its first streak of higher lows since 2016.Notice GE shares have also crossed back above the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white, and this time seem a little more willing to stay here.Zooming out to the weekly chart we can see this week's strength presses against the line that's capped all the key highs going back to May of last year.Clearly there's more work to be done. But, if General Electric shares can move above its recent ceilings, it becomes much easier to justify buying.It also becomes much easier to justify upgrades; don't think for a minute analysts' handling of the turnaround story aren't being scrutinized more than they normally might for other names.Just wait and watch. The Final WordI'm all too aware that penning these kinds of ideas is maddening to a whole slew of peopleâ¦ professionals as well as amateurs. The notion that a chart can lead to opinion changes rather than the other way around is often dismissed. And, there was a point in time, years ago, when such an idea should have been dismissed.The market's changed though. Fundamentals don't matter nearly as much as stories do, assuming that fundamentals mean anything anymore. In the case of General Electric right now, they may not.Whatever the case, don't kid yourself about what GE stock is here. You're not making a bet on the company by buying it now, or after any cross above $10.48.You're making a bet on how the masses are going to feel about GE at some point in the foreseeable future. Indirectly, you're betting on how analysts are going to change their opinions when they absolutely have to.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-11	2019-06-11 11:30:34	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Raytheon Deal Upends the Aerospace Playing Field	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- No aerospace and defense company has bet bigger on the benefits of scaleÂ than United Technologies Corp. Its latest megadeal with Raytheon Co. should be a wake-up call to its rivals.United Technologies isÂ mergingÂ with Raytheon in an all-stock transaction that will create aÂ behemoth with about $75 billion in sales spanning jet engines, airplane seats, missile-defense systems and radar technologies. There have been only four aerospace and defense deals valued at more than $10 billion in the past decade, and United Technologies now accounts for three of them. As for the others, Boeing Co. spent more on publicly disclosed aerospace M&A over that period than either General Electric Co. orÂ Honeywell International Inc., reflecting aÂ push to bring more of its supply-chain in house.Â Â Both Honeywell and GE have their reasons for sitting out the M&A rush. After former Honeywell CEOÂ Dave Cote made a failed attempt at merging with United Technologies in 2016, his successorÂ Darius Adamczyk has preferred to focus on streamlining his company and making small, strategic software bets. And while new GE CEO Larry Culp has talked a lot recently about eventually playing âoffenseâ via M&A, the companyâs power unit remains mired in a slump and off-balance sheet liabilities still loom large.GEâsÂ challenges were just starting to come to light when United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes made a $30 billion play for Rockwell Collins Inc. in 2017. Some speculated the sidelining of GE as a counterbidder was one reason he decided to jump on the opportunity.Â  Nearly two years later, GE is still nowhere near healthy enough to contemplate a credible competing offer for Raytheon. But the consolidating landscape may promptÂ both itÂ and Honeywell to think more aggressively about dealmaking. Â  Â United Technologies is still in the process of integrating the Rockwell Collins purchase, which closed late last year. Management is apt to be distracted as it juggles that process, the Raytheon deal and a plan to spin off its Carrier building-controls and Otis elevator units. There may be an opportunity in the short-term for the company's rivals toÂ pick up market share. Honeywellâs Adamczyk has made the argument that scale doesnât matter nearly as much as the quality of the product and has said he feels comfortable with how his company has differentiated itself. Thereâs some validity to that. I myself have been skeptical of the ultimate value of scale at a time when Boeing is pushing for constant cost cuts and encroaching on its suppliersâ territory with its own parts and services offerings.But pressure will grow on small and mid-range aerospace suppliersÂ to merge to stay relevant. And theÂ sheer breadth of the United Technologies-Raytheon-Rockwell Collins business will make itÂ difficult for even the biggest companies to simply stand pat.For one, United Technologies now has all the right pieces to become a clear leader in the race to develop connected aircraft. The Rockwell Collins deal gave it expertise in avionics, essentially the brains of the airplane. Raytheon will give it cyber-security expertise, helping to solve one of the key concerns airlines have about digitizing parts of their planes. Honeywell has made its own impressive inroads into the digital realm via its GoDirect software services, crowd-sourced radar and wireless connectivity tools, but it will now have to contend with much fiercer competition. Boeing, too, had been hoping for a piece of the burgeoning connected-aircraft market. Stifel Financial Corp. analyst Joseph DeNardi said he had long seen the company as a possible acquirer of Raytheon. But the cash-flow drain precipitated by the grounding of the companyâs 737 Max jet makes large-scale M&A untenable right now and the ensuing crisis has raised questions about whether Boeing should even be allowed to further tighten its grip on the aerospace market.The deal some investors still dream about is a combination of Honeywell and GEâs aviation units. Culpâs repeated talk of eventually playing offense has made me wonder if heâs thinking more seriously about a transaction of that magnitude. Even combined, the companies would still trailÂ the sales volumeÂ of a merged United Technologies-Raytheon, but it would go a long way toward catching them up. There are also plenty of reasons to think a Honeywell-GE aerospace merger wouldnât happen.Â It would be enormously complicated, particularly when it comes to determining an appropriate valuation for a GE aviation unit for whichÂ the companyâs own investors have wildly different estimations.Honeywellâs Adamczyk has already successfully resisted calls from activist investor Dan Loeb to carve out the aerospace unit into a separate entity, although arguably his software investments could go a lot further if applied to a more focused company. An alternative may be for Honeywell or GE to copy United Technologiesâ playbook and increase their exposure to the defense industry. The union of Raytheon and United Technologies has called attention to the dearth of commercial exposure at Northrop Grumman Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp., says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Douglas Rothacker.Any further consolidation in the aerospace and defense sector may be predicated on antitrust regulatorsâ view of the United Technologies-Raytheon combination. The companies say they have very little overlap and are promising to share half of their targeted $1 billion in cost savings with their U.S. government customers. But President Donald Trump expressed some concern about the merger to CNBC on Monday, questioning whether it may dampen competition for military projects. (1)Either way, United Technologies CEO Hayesâs willingness to pursue such a dramatic rethink of his company has already radically changed the game for aerospace and defense companies.Â His rivals willÂ likely have to change as well to keep pace.(1) Of note: The$20 billion mergerHarris Corp. announced last year with fellow defense contractor L3 Technologies Inc. is also still awaiting regulatory signoff, although that's expected to come soon.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-06-10	2019-06-10 17:57:26	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Merger Boosts the Long-Term Fortunes of the New Raytheon Stock	News of a merger between Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) (UTC) initially sent both stocks higher in Monday trading, though UTX has since pulled back. The deal will combine a defense business and an industrial conglomerate with a foothold in both the defense and commercial aircraft industries. While this deal brings changes to holders of both Raytheon stock and UTX stock, the combined entity should bring more focus while increasing the size of the new company's customer base.Source: FlickrUnder terms of the deal, UTC will merge its Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney aircraft engine businesses with Raytheon Company. Analysts expect this new company, which they will call Raytheon Technologies, to have a value of about $121 billion. It will also become the aerospace industry's second-largest company, lagging only Boeing (NYSE:BA) in size.They expect to begin with about a 50-50 split between commercial and defense-related sales. However, as defense growth slows, the commercial side could grow larger over time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A &quot;Merger of Equals&quot; Defines the New Raytheon StockBoth companies consider it a &quot;merger of equals,&quot; as it will include no takeover premium. UTX stockholders will own 57% of the company and appoint eight of the 15 directors. Holders of Raytheon stock will receive 2.3348 shares in the new company for every share currently owned. UTC CEO Greg Hayes will become CEO of the company. Current Raytheon CEO Tom Kennedy will take the role of executive chairman for two years.  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows Wall Street predicts the deal will close sometime in 2020. UTX will also have to spin off its non-aerospace businesses. As part of the deal, it will sell the Otis Elevator Company. It also will unload its UTC Climate, Controls, & Security subsidiary. This division owns HVAC manufacturer Carrier and Kidde, who makes smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors. Deal Bolsters the Case for RTN StockI see this as a win for investors. With the merger, Raytheon stock will benefit from having an outlet outside of the defense industry with which it can apply some of its technology. For now, analysts predict earnings increase for RTN stock of 14.7% this year. As increases in defense spending continue to slow, this gives Raytheon an outlet for growth not dependent on government largesse.Holders of UTX stock will also benefit. Wall Street predicts only 4.9% profit growth for United Technologies this year. However, in the previous quarter, UTX stock saw its largest revenue increases in the divisions it will retain. Hence, spinning off low-growth segments such as Otis and Carrier should lead to greater revenue increases.Also, the two firms have little overlap in terms of business lines. UTC produces engines and parts for aircraft. Raytheon focuses on missiles. Hence, most analysts believe the deal will gain the approval of antitrust regulators.Moreover, this offers investors a defense-related alternative to Boeing. Thanks to this deal, investors now have another diversified aerospace company from which to choose. Analysts see no signs Raytheon Technologies will suffer from the sort of trouble Boeing has, with its 737 MAX issues.Further, it represents a further move away from industrial conglomerates. This helps reassure current holders of UTX stock that they will not become a mishmash of unrelated businesses like the GE (NYSE:GE) of past decades. It will also help the company keep up with Honeywell (NYSE:HON), which has also increased its focus. These benefits should help bolster the RTN stock price. Concluding Thoughts on the MergerThe new Raytheon stock will offer investors the best of both Raytheon and United Technologies, increasing the focus while broadening the customer base. With the merger, Raytheon gains two divisions as well as a foothold in the commercial side of the business. Holders of UTX stock get a more focused aircraft and aerospace company. They will also benefit from not owning a stock held back by lower-performing, unrelated divisions.Both stocks moved higher after the companies announced the deal.

2019-05-29	2019-05-29 14:45:44	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	What Do the Charts Say About General Electric Stock?	Shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) have been holding their ground so far in 2019. GE stock, which was suffering from a precipitous decline going into the end of 2018, has drawn interest from retail investors for a long time. That's because for many years GE was an American industrial icon.Source: Shutterstock The power, energy, aerospace and consumer-staples sectors all used products with the well-known &quot;GE&quot; logo. Mismanagement, poor acquisitions, pension obligations and low-quality cash flows ultimately led to GE's demise, though. These issues were slowly (and rather painfully) uncovered as investors began to realize what the cash-flow statements and balance sheet were suggesting.GE stock entered 2017 at almost $30 a share. In December 2018, it hit a low near $6.50 and ultimately fell more than 75% from peak to trough.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June What do the charts of GE stock suggest now? Trading General Electric StockIf investors bought General Electric stock back in December, they're doing quite well. But even that massive rally -- during which GE stock jumped some 70% -- wasn't enough to propel GE out of its downtrend. As you can see on the daily chart above, GE continues to squeeze lower.The 200-day moving average isn't doing GE stock  any favors, and GE  is now below all three major moving averages. We've flagged $9 as support a few times, a level that has now held through two earnings reports. But as GE's highs continue to drop, this $9 level is starting to look suspect.If GE stock can't bounce back over its major moving averages and eventually exceed its downtrend resistance, its support could be in jeopardy. If $9 doesn't hold, sub-$8 prices don't seem unreasonable, particularly if sentiment towards GE stock sours as well.A similar scene is playing out on the weekly chart, as shown below.On this chart, downtrend resistance is much more prominent. A series of purple arrows highlights the &quot;lower highs&quot; theme we've seen playing out for some time now. Like the 200-day moving average, the 50-week moving average is still providing stiff resistance. While the 10-week moving average had been a support level from January through March, it has wavered over the past seven weeks. Last week, it gave way, and a test of $9 would not be surprising now.GE stock has &quot;descending triangle&quot; written all over it. That is, the stock is making continuously lower highs and moving ever closer towards its support level. If GE stock closes below $9, it will deal a big blow to the bulls. If General Electric stock closes over $10.40-$10.50, a lot of the recent damage could be repaired, potentially sparking a rally by GE. The Bottom Line on GE StockJPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa has very closely followed GE stock, and he's made some very good calls on it. He was the first to downgrade GE to &quot;sell&quot; and rode it all the way lower until December. That's when he raised his &quot;sell&quot; rating to a &quot;hold,&quot; but maintained his $6 price target. Tusa questioned where all the optimism was coming from and remains highly skeptical about General Electric stock.In April Tusa went back to a &quot;sell &quot;rating, cutting his price target on GE stock to $5 from $6. On May 1, he said the company's first-quarter earnings results were &quot;far from a disaster,&quot; which may seem encouraging, but he also said they were &quot;far from a blowout.&quot;So where are we now? I've been following the action of GE stock, and it's telling me one thing: General Electric is a &quot;show-me&quot; stock. Meaning,  GE needs to prove that it's got its groove back, and it is not worthy of benefit-of-the-doubt treatment. It doesn't help that Honeywell (NYSE:HON), 3M Co (NYSE:MMM), and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) are all better companies and have been under pressure lately as well.On Wednesday, GE CEO Larry Culp reiterated the company's forecast for up to $2 billion of negative free cash flow (FCF) this year and flat  FCF in 2020. That has done little to instill confidence in GE stock lately, even though that type of outlook has boosted GE stock in the past. The failure of General Electric stock to rally on the guidance reiteration  makes me confident about avoiding the name for now,  even if I miss some gains as a result.Watch how GE handles $9. If it falls below that level,  it's in trouble. But if GE stock overcomes its resistance, it may be worth buying.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-04-29	2019-04-29 09:31:32	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Should You Buy General Electric Stock Ahead of Earnings This Week?	General Electric (NYSE:GE) has been rather volatile so far this year, with bulls and bears both looking for big moves. After bottoming at $6.66 in December, GE stock is quickly up more than 30% in the first four months of the year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 10.8%.Source: Shutterstock Management is trying to tell an optimistic yet realistic story. But will investors be patient enough to stick with General Electric stock?When General Electric earnings come out on April 30, investors will want to hear that business is still on track. New CEO Larry Culp has been talking a strong turnaround for GE, but he's toeing a difficult line. On the one hand, he needs to be upbeat enough to keep investors around. Keep in mind, this stock fell from $30 to almost $6.50 in about two years. That said, Culp can't make a bunch of promises he knows aren't achievable. Unfortunately, GE's future is not so simple and it will be anything but a smooth ride.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Free Cash Flow is Key for GE StockOne of the big worries for GE stock is its cash flow situation. Simply put, what was once a free cash flow (FCF) machine is now struggling to stay cash flow positive.After the most recent General Electric earnings report back in January and its outlook presentation in March, GE stock got a boost. That's despite management saying 2019 would be a reset year. &quot;This is not going to be quick by any stretch, but we understand why we underperformed in 2018,&quot; Culp said.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt So why the rally?Culp added that he believes FCF will turn positive in fiscal 2020 and improve further in 2021. That is good news, but it won't be a fast development considering that GE has yet to report its first-quarter results for 2019.Long-time bear Stephen Tusa, an analyst from JPMorgan, wasn't buying into the optimism. Tusa has nailed the decline in GE stock, pinning an underperform rating on the stock before any of his peers. However, in December he raised that rating to neutral while maintaining his $6 price target. After last month's FCF update though, Tusa shifted back to the bear side earlier in April. He cut his rating back to underweight and slashed his price target to $5.Investors are &quot;underestimating the severity of the challenges and underlying risks at GE, while overestimating the value of small positives,&quot; he reasoned, highlighted concerns along the FCF front.In 2015, General Electric had trailing FCF of $20 billion. Its current figure? Negative $3.8 billion. Indeed, it will be a long road to recovery. Trading General Electric Stock  Click to EnlargeCurrent estimates call for first-quarter earnings of 9 cents per share, down from 16 cents a share last quarter. Consensus revenue expectations call for sales of $27.1 billion, a 5.6% year-over-year decrease. The company will have to build off those results if it wants to see any meaningful upside from current levels.  * 10 Dow Jones Stocks Holding the Blue Chip Index Back Will better-than-expected Q1 results drive GE stock higher? They could, particularly with it hanging near the bottom of its recent range.To be clear, General Electric stock is sort of like Snap (NYSE:SNAP) to me. I'm not really bullish on the name and prefer others in the industry -- like Honeywell (NYSE:HON) over GE, or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) over Snap. That said, a stock can only go so low for so long before a bounce is in store. Under those developments, we have to respect the technicals.When GE stock jumped to above $11 in late February, shares had almost doubled from the December lows. The stock was also over all three major moving averages and downtrend resistance. Two months later and downtrend resistance is still firmly in place, while General Electric stock is below all of its major moving averages.Bulls need to see $9 hold as support now. This marks recent support and was resistance in January. A drop below $9 puts sub-$8.50 on the table, with a potential drop down to $7.50 being possible. On the upside, over $9.50 could set up a move back the 200-day and downtrend resistance near $10. That will be a key test.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell no position in the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-26	2019-04-26 12:33:22	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	AT&T Stock Is a Must-Buy Dividend Stud on Earnings Pullback	On Wednesday, AT&T (NYSE:T) stock tumbled, falling about 4% after the company reported its first-quarter  earnings. Earnings that were in line with analysts' consensus estimate, lower-than-expected revenue, and a decline in DirecTV subscribers caused investors to be less interested in buying T stock.Source: Shutterstock I think the decline of AT&T stock created a buying opportunity , but we need to look at T stock a little differently than most other stocks. Specifically, investors should think of it as an income vehicle rather than a stock.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy Now We could surely find a stock that provides a better overall return than T stock. That's been true over the past year, and it will probably be true again in the future. As Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) all push higher, it's hard to hold T stock instead of those alternatives.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors shouldn't be all-in on AT&T stock. Their portfolios should be diverse and include names like MSFT, HON and QQQ.  AT&T should be viewed as an enhanced bank savings account or CD. The stock has a 6.6% dividend yield, a yield that can't be obtained at any bank. Such a yield would raise a red flag for most stocks.In T's case though, I think think the company's cash flow is large enough to ensure that its payout will not be cut.While T's debt load may keep a lid on the stock, let's see how its free-cash flow will enable it to reduce its debt. Breaking Down T StockAT&T earnings of 86 cents per share were in-line with analysts' consensus outlook, while its sales of $44.88 billion missed the average estimate by $277 million. While its top line did grow almost 18% year-over-year, that growth was primarily driven by its Time Warner acquisition. AT&T missed revenue estimates for the second consecutive quarter and for the fourth time in its last five quarters. However, AT&T is not a growth story. It's a cash flow story.T's DirecTV business is struggling with subscriber losses in a cord-cutting environment. However, T's acquisition of Time Warner has been lucrative, not just on the revenue front, but primarily on the cash flow front. AT&T reported $11.1 billion of operating cash flow (OCF), up 24% YOY.Of that, $5.9 billion became free cash flow after capital expenditures were deducted. The Time Warner acquisition helped AT&T's free cash flow surge more than 110% YoY.The company paid out $3.7 billion in dividends, leaving excess free-cash flow of $2.15 billion. That gave AT&T stock a FCF/dividend payout ratio of 63.3%. A year ago, the company had a FCF deficit of $241 million after it paid out dividends.This is a big improvement in the company's FCF situation and I think it makes AT&T stock attractive. It means the dividend is safe, while management can focus on paying down debt. Its Time Warner asset gives AT&T strong streaming content, and its cell phone business remains a consistent cash generator. Trading T StockAt the beginning of April, T stock broke out, overcoming its downtrend resistance. However, after the company reported its earnings on Wednesday, T stock gave up those breakout gains. Now, though, the risk/reward ratio of T stock is favorable again.The stock sits right near its prior downtrend resistance (depicted by the blue line). A close below this level could signal that more declines are ahead and would be an unfortunate development for the bulls. However, T stock also sits near several major moving averages, including the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day.The 100-day, which is just above $30, is currently the lowest. Since AT&T stock closed below this mark last session, it has lost all moving average support, as well as prior downtrend resistance. If it drops below $30, things could get slippery.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long T.

2019-04-25	2019-04-25 15:36:42	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	10 Automation Stocks to Buy for the 21st Century	Advancement in technology is an inevitability which forces all of us to adapt to new realities. As such, the best stocks to buy for the long haul invariably focus on automation and artificial intelligence. But while progress is always a net positive, the transition is certainly a painful one.What I like, though, about this current political season is that we finally have a candidate who's addressing this issue. Democratic presidential candidate and former tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang knows first-hand the benefits of automated innovations. At the same time, he's also aware of the darker side of surging automation stocks: displaced workers and forgotten communities.In principle, this drive for viable solutions underlines Yang's so-called &quot;freedom dividend.&quot; A form of universal basic income, Yang proposes giving every American over the age of 18 a check for $1,000. He views this as the best way to give struggling families a chance to catch up to the exploding valuations of tech stocks, which in many ways is emblematic of these workers' displacement.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile Republicans remain wary of Yang's proposal as undisguised socialism, his plan is the only one addressing massive changes ahead. The old mantra of &quot;working hard&quot; no longer is valid. After all, you can't work harder than a robot. Plus, putting money into American workers' hands gives them an opportunity to profit off these automation stocks to buy.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years Finally, what I find refreshing about Yang is his matter-of-fact approach. Not once has he called for stopping automation or tech stocks. Rather, he wants the U.S. to adapt to the shifting landscape before our adversaries do.A freedom dividend is just one step toward managing an exciting future. The other? Investing in these 10 automation stocks to buy: Rockwell Automation (ROK)If you're seeking automation stocks to buy, it doesn't hurt to consider a company with the word already written in its name. That's the case for Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), which specializes in industrial technologies. However, what makes ROK different is that they approach automation from a holistic standpoint, ensuring every cog in the gear works seamlessly.Another reason why you'll want to take a closer look at ROK is its financial stability. Unlike upstart tech stocks, Rockwell is in the long-haul business. The company features strong profitability margins, along with steadily increasing revenues over the past three years. Additionally, Rockwell sports a stable balance sheet with manageable debt.Year-to-date, ROCK stock is up over 20%, despite an earnings miss that battered the stock today. While industrial operations is a legacy industry, automated operations is an entirely different story. Plus, with a 2.2% dividend yield, ROK is one of the most well-rounded automation stocks to buy -- this dip could just make a better entry point. Honeywell (HON)Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is a massive, multi-specialty firm that's competing against an increasingly nimble and agile industry. Under such circumstances, HON stock has no business being among the best tech stocks to buy. Still, the company does big and complicated quite well, which is not something I can say about its peers.Here's what I love about HON stock: despite enjoying legacy status, Honeywell never rests on its laurels. Its automation systems cover a wide breadth of industries, including smart HVAC for corporate buildings and hotel rooms. Furthermore, they're involving in critical airflow control mechanisms, such as the systems that leading hospitals adopt.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before They Give Back 2019 Gains Additionally, Honeywell features strongly in multiple civilian and military products. Since opportunities abound for both segments, I see HON as one of top long-term stocks to buy. Eaton (ETN)When most people think about automation stocks, they usually conjure up images of giant robots on the assembly line. However, the real innovation is in the small details: we're talking components such as sensors, switches and motor-control centers that are geared specifically for AI-based platforms. That's exactly what Eaton (NYSE:ETN) focuses on.The beauty of ETN stock is that the underlying firm's products are found everywhere, not just on the assembly line. For instance, Eaton has a commercial vehicle division that specializes in control buttons and switches. They also have a similar unit that produces these products for aircraft.After a dip in late 2015 through early 2016, Eaton is on a steady recovery path. Since that time, annual revenues have ticked higher, while management worked on controlling its debt exposure. On a YTD basis, ETN is up 23%. ABB (ABB)Primarily, the reason why automation stocks present so much longer-term opportunity is the piggyback effect. Innovations in this sector don't just occur in a vacuum. Instead, many industries piggyback off a base innovation, which then leads toward multiple benefits.A great example is ABB (NYSE:ABB). Known largely for its industrial work, ABB recently generated headlines for developing satellite-mounted optical equipment. This system is able to measure greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, facilitating fact-based debates on climate change.It's the automation industry's ability to morph into different applications that makes ABB stock a compelling, contrarian buy. Over the years, ABB has earned a name among tech stocks, but for the wrong reasons. In an effort to right the ship, management divested several business units.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt While it doesn't look great now, ABB deserves a look as one of the stocks to buy this year. It's an exceptionally relevant company that's going through a difficult restructuring process. Once finished, ABB can surprise people -- in a good way, this time. PTC (PTC)Automation stocks to buy don't always focus on physical equipment, although that is undeniably the popular image. Instead, some of the technologies developed in the automation and AI sphere has produced profound innovations in augmented reality.According to software and services firm PTC's (NASDAQ:PTC) website, software developers will make the most use out of AR technologies. That's not surprising. However, what is surprising is that the industrial products segment comes in a close second, while the automotive and education sectors are closing the gap.Furthermore, several job functions will integrate the AR platform heavily, including design, manufacturing, and marketing and sales. This is why Andrew Yang is so passionate about his freedom dividend and the coming automation wave. With it, American families can receive quality, relevant education toward the jobs of tomorrow.That's also a plus for PTC stock, where the underlying company champions AR-based services. Danaher (DHR)While Yang's extensive economic plans have energized the Democrats, not all political changes are so positive for the markets. Take for example the constant complaints over high pharmaceutical prices and the calls for a single-payer healthcare system. Such news has brought wild volatility to the publicly traded healthcare stocks.Against that backdrop, you wouldn't expect Danaher (NYSE:DHR) to do well this year. Though not a really a healthcare company, DHR creates products and automated systems for the life sciences and diagnostics business. However, DHR shares are up over 27% YTD, making them one of the top-performing stocks to buy of 2019.  * 7 Tech Stocks With Too Much Risk, Not Enough Upside While you can expect a cooldown after such a robust rally, DHR stock should soon find its groove. Automation hasn't just made our lives easier; it has brought substantive changes to our health, expanding the possibilities of medicine. Danaher will lead these developments as we move further into the 21st century. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)On a similar note, investors -- particularly those with a contrarian mindset -- should consider Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG). Recently, ISRG stock crumbled on news that a Canaccord analyst downgraded the surgical-systems company. To be fair, Intuitive Surgical didn't really impress in its last earnings disclosure.That said, those who dumped shares probably found motivation strictly from nearer-term considerations. Those with a farther outlook can see what most bulls see: a radical shift in medical expectations with the minimally invasive da Vinci surgical system. Rather than replace human doctors, da Vinci provides surgeons with an accretive platform.In the future, we can expect this and related systems to allow surgeons to perform previously impossible surgeries. From both a monetary and humanitarian standpoint, ISRG stock offers tremendous potential. Therefore, I'd put ISRG on a list of stocks to buy, especially on this dip. HollySys Automation Technologies (HOLI)Headquartered in China, HollySys Automation Technologies (NASDAQ:HOLI) suffered badly in 2018 due to the trade war and geopolitical tensions. Last year, HOLI stock dropped almost 22% in the markets. It's off to a much better start this year, though, gaining over 21% since the beginning of January.While I'm not the biggest fan of Chinese stocks, I can appreciate HOLI for its relevancy in a still-rising economic power. Indeed, if we elect another president who spouts useless mantras that tickle the soul but do nothing for the wallet, China will almost certainly overtake us.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees I'm hoping that scenario doesn't become a reality anytime soon. But from a purely investment point-of-view, you can trust HOLI stock. If we've learned anything, it's that progress doesn't stop for anyone. MKS Instruments (MKSI)A leading producer of customizable automation platforms, MKS Instruments (NASDAQ:MKSI) is one of the lesser-known automation stocks. That's a benefit to shrewd investors, who can look at the company's fundamental strengths. For instance, MKS stock is buoyed by the organization's strong profitability and growth metrics, as well as a reasonably stable balance sheet.But what really caught my attention was MKS' business diversity. Along with its semiconductor, industrial technologies and biologics divisions, MKS also features prominently in defense. Specifically, the company manufacturers LIDAR, which is a ranging and remote sensing system. As defense and security concerns transition to asymmetric threats, meeting 21st century problems with equitable solutions is a non-negotiable.The profound benefits associated with the company haven't gone unnoticed. On a YTD basis, MKSI is up over 56%, making it one of the best-performing automation stocks. Considering last year's high of over $127, MKSI still has room to run. Mitsubishi Electric (MIELY)Over the last few years, Japanese companies have disappointed contrarians hoping for a comeback. While many names were energized following Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's election victory, they failed to convincingly maintain their momentum. Others, like Mitsubishi Electric (OTCMKTS:MIELY), simply collapsed. Last year, MIELY stock hemorrhaged 34%.This year, though, the narrative is different, with shares up over 22%. It doesn't make up for the losses that shareholders incurred last year. However, it is a significant start. More importantly, the fundamentals are in place for a comeback. Despite the ugliness surrounding the company -- and Japan as a whole -- Mitsubishi is a leader in robotics and industrial electronics.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years For instance, Mitsubishi developed the world's fastest elevator in China's tallest building. That's quite an achievement, considering the historical hostilities between the two nations. Since global economic activity is shifting eastward, you'll do well to look into MIELY stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

When times are good, companies are able to invest more in technology to put themselves ahead of the competition. When times are bad, companies look to get leaner - which means substituting human personnel for cost-saving factory automation systems. (Businesses facing the threat of closure quickly get religion on changes.)With the threat of recession growing in 2019, industrial automation stocks may prove a great opportunity. In fact, the current market environment might prove doubly important for factory automation companies. Trade conflict, such as the one between the U.S. and China, can put pressure on manufacturers to move their operations - a costly process that entices companies to make their relocated facilities more cost-efficient.As industry expert Rick Blaisdell has written, the next wave of industrial automation (as well as several other industries) is based on the &quot;Internet of Things&quot; - the interconnectivity of devices past traditional products such as computers and smartphones. IoT solutions using sensors, networks and software can help operate machines, improve quality control, cut down on analytical errors and enhance safety. Thus, many automation plays will be IoT plays, too.Here are six top stocks to buy if you want to gain exposure to the potential all-weather opportunity of industrial automation.

2019-03-11	2019-03-11 14:09:34	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	Does General Electricâs Stock Chart Point to New Lows?	What happened to General Electric (NYSE:GE)? The once-steady industry stock with a respectable dividend has been anything but reliable over the past 18 months. Even after GE stock price collapsed to $6.66 per share, GE stock still remains wildly volatile, as it surged more than 50% from those lows before its recent retreat.Source: Shutterstock The gyrations of GE stock price have left long-term investors -- assuming there are any left -- scratching their heads. Will GE be forced to divest its top-notch businesses in an attempt to repair its balance sheet, leaving it with no productive units? Or will GE's management be able to strategically offload enough assets and turn cash-flow positive, enabling GE stock to get back on track?  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio That remains unclear, but even under the rosiest of circumstances, the time frame of the recovery of GE stock price has now been moved back.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips GE's Recovery Takes a DetourAs I've written previously on InvestorPlace, GE stock price has been a bit hotter that its fundamentals justify. GE stock went from a low of $6.66 (before the market bottom in late-December) to more than $11. We've seen big rallies in Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) too, but they are doing much better from a business perspective. But aside from a few asset sales, the fundamentals of General Electric stock really weren't improving all that much.Its cash flow is still under pressure, its balance sheet is still weak and GE is being forced out of multiple businesses. Basically, I don't think that General Electric stock deserved to rally more than 66% in a few months.JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa, who's bearish on GE stock, agrees with me  or should I say, I agree with Tusa, who was the first analyst to raise the alarm on General Electric stock. He continually slashed his price target on the way down, nailing every bit of the decline before it happened. Around the lows, Tusa bumped his rating from &quot;sell&quot; to &quot;neutral&quot;, but maintained his $6 price target.He now calls that price target &quot;generous&quot; after the company's latest news. Earlier this week, GE CEO Larry Culp said that the conglomerate's industrial-free-cash flow would be negative this year. He painted a no-nonsense picture that basically said the turnaround won't start for a long time. Tusa says the turnaround will take a couple of years, arguing that GE stock probably hasn't bottomed yet.On Mar. 14, General Electric will provide its outlook. Those who are bulls on General Electric stock  will view the event as an opportunity for GE's management to reignite the shares. Those with more bearish views on General Electric , like JPMorgan's Shawn Quigg, think that optimism is likely too high going into the event. For traders, this event will also be an opportunity. Trading GE Stock How far can GE stock fall on negative news? If the shares reach Tusa's $6 price target, we're talking about more than 36% downside from their current levels. Also keep in mind, though, that if General Electric does hit Tusa's price target, it will have taken out its 2018 lows as well.When trading GE stock, there are a few levels to keep in mind. The first is $8.86. If General Electric stock falls below this mark, GE stock will be below both its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, as well as its prior downtrend support. That would open up the possibility of a drop below $8 and increase the odds of a retest of the stock's lows.If General Electric stock gets to $10, I want to see how it handles that level. At $10, there is short-term downtrend resistance, as well as the 21-day moving average of $9.86 (not pictured above). It will be significant if that area becomes resistance.Ultimately the charts are losing some of their bullish luster, and new lows could be on the way. However, we need to monitor this name and some of the existing support levels before making that call. Stay flexible with General Electric stock.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-02-07	2019-02-07 17:51:42	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	7 Reasons You Want Boeing Stock in Your Portfolio	Did you ever notice that sometimes it takes investors a little time to appreciate a company's performance in a given year? Take Boeing (NYSE:BA) for example. If rated on a scale of one to 10 in terms of financial and business success over the past year, it would have rated a 12. Yet, Boeing stock barely cracked a double-digit total return in 2018 -- up 11.7%, including a 2% dividend yield -- leaving some to wonder if China had pummeled the world's largest aircraft manufacturer into submission. Not by a long shot. Five weeks into 2019, Boeing stock is up 28% year to date through Feb. 5. As Matt Damon's character from Good Will Hunting would say, &quot;How do you like them apples?&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBoeing's record year shouldn't have come as a surprise to investors. I was talking about its stock as early as April, suggesting a $1,000 stock price wasn't an impossibility. Now, do I think that's going to happen in 2019? No, I do not. How about 2020? Doubt it. 2021? Doable but a bit of stretch.   Buy now, and if Boeing management continue to execute at a high level and the economy doesn't collapse too severely, I would guess 2022 is the year Boeing stock hits $1,000.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond So, if you're thinking about buying its stock, here are seven reasons why you should. Boeing Reported Record SalesBoeing went over $100 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2018; $101.1 billion to be exact, an 8% increase over fiscal 2017. Now, if you think 8% growth isn't a big deal, consider that works out to a $7.1 billion gain, about the same amount as the alternative asset manager Blackstone Group's (NYSE:BX) annual revenue. If Boeing's revenue growth were an S&P 500 company, it would have finished 398th in 2018. So, you might want to rethink just how good its record sales were. They were otherworldly. And that's just the top line. On the bottom line, Boeing's operating margins increased by 90 basis points in 2018 to 11.9%. For every dollar of Boeing's $101 billion in revenue, it generated nearly 12 cents in operating profits. In the fourth quarter alone, its operating margins jumped by 270 basis points to 14.7%. Expect them to keep moving higher. It Should Have a Strong Year AheadAs good as 2018 was, 2019 is expected to be even better. Last year, Boeing produced 806 aircraft, a company record. With 5,900 aircraft in its backlog, CEO Dennis Muilenburg is ramping up production. In 2019, it expects to create 895 aircraft, an 11% year-over-year increase. Amazingly, that works out to a plane getting built every ten hours -- for an entire year. That's a blistering pace by anyone's standards. Even with increased pace, it will still take Boeing close to seven years to bang out all the orders it has got. It's a nice problem to have.&quot;Our One Boeing focus, clear strategies for growth, and leading positions in large and growing markets, give us confidence for continued strong performance, revenue expansion and solid execution across all three businesses, which is reflected in our 2019 guidance,&quot; Muilenburg stated in the Q4 2018 press release.  * The 9 Best Stocks to Invest In During a Manic Market Boeing expects $110.5 billion in revenue and $20.00 a share in core earnings at the midpoint for 2019 with operating margins as high as 15%, 310 basis points higher than in 2018.I'd call its outlook impressive. Wouldn't you? The Trade Dispute Is Not Slowing It DownAlthough the final quarter of 2018 was not kind to Boeing stock as fears of a protracted trade war between China and the U.S. would hurt the company's sales in the country, it appears those concerns, at least as it relates to Boeing, were wholly unfounded. &quot;I can tell you -- having been intimately involved in the discussions and engagement with the governments both in the U.S. and China - we see progress on that front,&quot; Muilenburg said of the trade negotiations. &quot;We see convergence, and we also see that there's clearly a mutual benefit to having a healthy aerospace industry for both the U.S. and China.&quot;The fact is, China needs Boeing as much or more than Boeing needs China. The country's expected to add one billion new passengers between now and 2040. That means it requires a lot more planes. Despite all the estimates of China's insatiable demand for aircraft -- it accounts for 18% of the demand for new aircraft globally -- those might actually be conservative providing Boeing with an even bigger cash cow than initially thought.&quot;China needs the airplanes for growth to fuel their economy and to meet their passenger growth and cargo growth needs,&quot; Muilenburg said.How do you meet an insatiable demand? You do. Boeing's got a fabulous problem that any CEO would love to have. The Defense Business Is Doing OkayThe supposed weak link in the Boeing chain is the company's defense business. It had seen revenues drop from $32.1 billion in 2007 to $21.1 billion a decade later. However, the company dug deep in 2018, winning several lucrative contracts, and increasing revenues by 13% in the process to $23.2 billion. In 2019, Boeing expects the defense unit to grow sales by 14%, delivering a second consecutive year of growth for the embattled division. Although these numbers are encouraging, the unit did see profits drop by 27% to $1.59 billion. As long as the commercial aircraft continues to push margins higher, shareholders will likely take the good with the bad.  * 7 Stocks That Won Super Bowl Sunday In the long term, Boeing must address the defense business's margins. Global Services, the company's service business made a billion more than the defense business in 2018, on $6 billion less in sales.   It Has Enormous Free Cash FlowBoeing's ability to generate free cash flow is something that I was relishing earlier in 2018. &quot;In fiscal 2017, Boeing had $11.5 billion free cash flow, 85% of which was generated in the second through fourth quarters. If the same thing happens in 2018, Boeing should generate $18.3 billion in free cash flow,&quot; I wrote April 25 evaluating Boeing's Q1 2018 earnings. &quot;Based on an enterprise value of $201.6 billion ($199.0 billion market cap, plus $12.5 billion debt, less $9.9 billion cash), Boeing has a forward FCF yield of 9.1%, which in my estimation puts it in value territory.&quot;OK, so my free cash flow estimate missed by several billion -- Boeing generated 80% of its free cash flow in the final three quarters of 2018, not 85% -- but it was still an impressive showing, upping FCF by $2 billion or 17% year over year. As for FCF yield, it currently is 5.7% [Free Cash Flow of $13.6 billion divided by Enterprise Value of $237.3 billion (Market cap of $233.4 billion plus total debt of $13.9 billion less $10 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments)], which is pretty good considering it's gained 27% in five weeks. Assuming it hits the low-end of its outlook for operating cash flow in 2019 of $17 billion and allocates $2.3 billion to capital expenditures, free cash flow in 2019 should increase by 8% to $14.7 billion, bringing its FCF yield above 6%.Not bad for a tired old airplane manufacturer.    BA Stock Is a Big Momentum PlayWhat's the old saying? A body in motion tends to stay in motion. That describes Boeing stock to a T. Each week, Canada's national newspaper, The Globe and Mail, produces an article about the week's most oversold and overbought stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange. As Scott Barlow explains, a stock is thought to be oversold when its relative strength index (RSI) signal drops below 30 and overbought when it climbs above 70. For most of the past year, Boeing's RSI has been in a range between 30 and 75, rising above 70 on two occasions (October 2018, February 2019) and below 30 on a single occasion (November 2018). On a momentum basis, the chart suggests that BA is overbought at this point.  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio I've tried to highlight some of the reasons why investors should own Boeing in 2019 and beyond. Perhaps it will drop below $400 in the next few weeks. At that point, it will lose the &quot;overbought&quot; status and become a momentum buy once more. As I said earlier, Boeing is a potential $1,000 stock in the making.     It's Investing in Supersonic JetsWho can forget the Concorde? That marvel of technology that could get a person from London to New York in less than 3.5 hours.Well, Boeing announced Feb. 5 that it had made a significant investment in Aerion, the Nevada-based developer of a supersonic business jet that's estimated to cost $120 million a pop. To get the plane ready for service, Boeing is going to provide engineering, manufacturing and flight testing services. The AS2 jet will fly at 1,000 miles per hour, an increase of 70% over current business jets. Also helping with the jet are General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) who are responsible for the engines and cockpit respectively. Owned by Texas billionaire Robert Bass, consider this to be Boeing's version of a moonshot.  As of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-01	2019-02-01 20:21:50	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	5 Must-See Stock Charts for Monday: AMZN, GE, HON, ACB	"Another jobs report, another blowout gain. Despite what some market participants may feel, the labor market doesn't show any signs of a slow down. Throw in a continued stream of earnings and that's a lot for investors to digest going into the weekend. Let's look at a few must-see stock charts.

### Must-See Stock Charts #1: Amazon

Despite beating on earnings estimates, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is down about 5% after the company talked about higher spending and provided a weaker-than-expected outlook on first-quarter revenue.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Currently down near $1,630, shares are just below the 21-day moving average, but still above the 50-day near $1,600. That level also served as decent range support once extreme bouts of fourth-quarter selling subsided.

  * Missing required attributes. Please edit.



So what now? I would like to see Amazon stock stay above the 50-day moving average. Ultimately though, bulls are still okay so long as AMZN stock stays above the backside of prior downtrend resistance (blue line). If it begins to rally again, look to see how it does with the 200-day moving average and $1,750.

### Must-See Stock Charts #2: Chevron

Shares of Chevron (NYSE:CVX) are rallying after the company beat on earnings estimates and missed on revenue expectations. The move comes after the stock consolidated and drifted higher near the 21-day and 50-day moving averages.

Now pushing through the 200-day, it will be interesting to see if CVX can stay above this mark. Looming just ahead is downtrend resistance (blue line), which has weighed on CVX since May. I wouldn't be surprised to see it act as resistance once more, at least in the short term.

If CVX can push through, it could trigger a breakout.

### Must-See Stock Charts #3: Honeywell

Worries over Honeywell (NYSE:HON) will likely persist until China starts kicking out stronger economic growth numbers. But the company's better-than-expected earnings report helped relieve a little bit of investors' worries.

While the stock is off its session highs by a decent amount, it's over the 200-day moving average and downtrend resistance. That makes it a solid risk/reward trade for investors. Over these marks and HON is a long. Below and a retest of uptrend support and/or the 50-day is in the cards.

### Must-See Stock Charts #4: Aurora Cannabis

We talked about this one in January and it's paying off big time. Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) held exactly where it needed to and pushed right back through the 200-day.

Now sitting just below the $7.50 mark, a larger breakout could be brewing. The cannabis sector will need to stay hot next week for investors to take advantage, but a big move could trigger in ACB stock over $7.50.

### Must-See Stock Charts #5: General Electric

General Electric (NYSE:GE) was not able to hold onto all of its earnings-induced gains on Thursday, but the stock is still holding up over the prior session's low and is sticking above that $10 mark.

That's a good sign for bulls and if GE can consolidate for another day or two, a move higher could be on the table. If it does, look to see how it handles the $11 mark. I would expect it act as resistance. GE is improving but perhaps not to the point where its stock should be up 65% from the lows this quickly.

  * 7 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy That Tore Up Earnings 



On a pullback, look to see if uptrend support (purple line) helps keep it afloat. I consider $9 -- the prior breakout -- the must-hold level for GE bulls.

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is positive 
  * ETFs holding this stock have seen outflows over the last one-month 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

## Economic sentiment

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Industrials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Positive

The current level displays a positive indicator. HON credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels of the last 3 years, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

Honeywell adjusted profit, revenue rise above expectations	Shares of Honeywell International Inc.  were indicated slightly higher in premarket trade Friday after the diversified industrial company reported a fourth-quarter adjusted profit and revenue that rose above expectations, boosted by strength in its commercial aerospace, defense and warehouse automation business. The company swung to net income of $1.72 billion, or $2.31 a share, from a loss of $2.52 billion, or $3.32 a share, in the same period a year ago, which included charges related to tax reform and business separation costs. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $1.91, above the FactSet consensus of $1.89.

Looking ahead, the company expects 2019 EPS of $7.80 to $8.10, surrounding the FactSet consensus of $7.86, and sales of $36.0 billion to $36.9 billion, below the FactSet consensus of $37.07 billion. The stock has slipped 0.6% over the past three months, while the SPDR Industrial Select Sector ETF  has tacked on 0.9% and the S&P 500  has slipped 1.3%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/7a9eac0e-802f-307c-a6d5-18d5c34c7123/honeywell-adjusted-profit%2C.html?.tsrc=rss

Boeing's Big Surge Sets the Stage for Honeywell Earnings on Friday	"Shares of Boeing bounced 6.25% on Wednesday after crushing earnings estimates and guiding 2019 to another record year.  Interestingly, the demand read through could be a major positive for Honeywell, which also saw its stock rise modestly in anticipation of earnings at week's end as optimism builds.  ""Boeing's fourth quarter results and impressive 2019 guidance confirms our positive view on the strong growth within Aerospace industry,"" Jeff Marks, senior portfolio analyst for Action Alerts PLUS said."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/513cedc1-6920-3429-b938-507a8ee78fa6/boeing%27s-big-surge-sets-the.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-01-30	2019-01-30 20:12:36	HON	Honeywell International Inc.	5 Industrial Stocks to Buy	"In 2018, even the brightest industrial stocks weren't the best stocks for investors. The industrial sector had a rough year, as concerns about China and potentially slowing growth led investors to flee the space.

Indeed, as Barron's pointed out, the S&P 500 Industrial Sector Index lost 16% in 2018 -- erasing some $350 billion in market value. So far, however, 2019 has been better. The index is up over 9% already YTD, as cyclical concerns have faded.

Those concerns may rear their head again -- and investors still need to be cautious with the sector. But for those investors who are looking for the best industrial stocks, these five all fit the bill.

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



And with some help from the broad market and the economy as a whole, this time around they could be big winners for the rest of the year -- and beyond.

### 3M (MMM)

The case for 3M (NYSE:MMM) is pretty simple. The diversified manufacturer has been one of the best buy-and-hold industrial stocks in the market for years now. 3M isn't immune to the economic cycle, to be sure, but over its 117-year history, it has seen all sorts of economic environments.

No matter what has come, over most multiyear periods, MMM stock has delivered market-beating, double-digit annual returns. Of late, however, that hasn't been the case. MMM has pulled back from early 2018 highs -- and actually is down about 22% over the past year.

But after a solid Q4 report on Tuesday morning, 3M looks to be on track. And under $200, the stock trades at a reasonable 18.5x the midpoint of 2019 EPS guidance. A 2.8% dividend adds income as well.

MMM isn't going to be a torrid grower. But I've recommended it in the past as one of the best stocks to buy for young retirees -- and at this price, investors of all ages at least should take a long look.

### GMS (GMS)

Drywall and building products distributor GMS (NYSE:GMS) was hammered in 2018, as were many housing-related plays. But GMS stock, along with the sector as the whole, has started to recover in 2019. And there's more room to run, one reason GMS is one of my largest personal positions.

There are risks here. GMS has a heavily indebted balance sheet. It has exposure to new residential construction -- which already has slowed noticeably -- and commercial construction -- which could slow if the economy turns.

But there are real rewards here, too. I highlighted GMS last year as a small-cap stock that could double, and at $19, that's still the case. The stock trades at less than 6x forward EPS estimates, and growth and margin expansion have continued of late. GMS is looking to pay down debt, which should further de-risk the story and help the equity value going forward.

  * 7 High-Dividend Stocks Yielding More Than 5% (Plus a Bonus) 



Again, caution needs to be exercised here: this is a high-risk play. But the valuation and the opportunity for further growth, multiple expansion and deleveraging mean that GMS could be one of the best stocks in the market, particularly if investors get more aggressive in 2019.

### United Parcel Service (UPS)

Investors simply don't trust United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) anymore, and with some reason. UPS stock basically has been &quot;dead money&quot; for five years now. Long-running worries remain that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) eventually will compete with both UPS and rival FedEx (NYSE:FDX).

But it seems too early to write UPS off just yet. Earnings still are growing. A massive capital spending boost catalyzed by tax reform should drive savings in the future. And a 3.6% dividend yield should continue to rise for at least the next few years.

Here, too, there are risks. A macro downturn wouldn't help the cause, and Amazon is a worthy competitor should it more aggressively enter the space. But at around 13x earnings, at least some of those risks are priced in. And there's reason to think UPS, near the lower end of its multiyear range, should have at least one more rally in it.

### DowDuPont (DWDP)

In December, I called DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP) one of 15 2018 losers that would be among the best stocks for 2019. And indeed, DWDP has bounced nicely, rising almost 20% off December lows and almost 12% so far in 2019.

At $58, the gains likely aren't over. DowDuPont still has value to unlock as it breaks itself up into three companies in the coming years. Index moves and investor impatience likely led to at least some of the selling pressure in 2018 (though cyclical worries about the chemical sector didn't help), which should further ease in 2019-2020 as the process plays out.

  * 7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019 



It's worth remembering that investors cheered the initial plans, only to forget about their benefits amid growing concerns about macro growth. As investors are reminded of the opportunity -- and perhaps become less worried about the risks -- DWDP should continue to climb.

### Honeywell (HON)

Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) executed a pair of spinoffs itself last year, distributing shares of Resideo Technologies (NYSE:REZI) and Garrett Motion (NYSE:GTX). Since the spins, and amid the saga at rival General Electric (NYSE:GE), HON stock seems almost forgotten.

It shouldn't be. Even the slimmer Honeywell looks like one of the premier industrial stocks in the market. Valuation isn't compelling perhaps, with HON trading at 18x forward EPS and yielding 2.3%. But Honeywell continues to grow nicely, and its diversified portfolio (both in terms of products and geographies) provides some protection to upheaval in individual markets.

Like 3M, Honeywell is going to trade with the cycle -- and that's a risk. But like MMM, HON stock has been a long-term outperformer. For investors who still trust the cycle and are looking for a set-it-and-forget-it type of play, Honeywell stock might be the right choice.

As of this writing, Vince Martin is long shares of GMS Inc. He has no positions in any other securities mentioned.

## Honeywell in collaboration with Optoro

On January 10, 2019, Honeywell (HON) announced that it plansÂ to collaborate with Optoro. As a part of this collaboration, Honeywellâs Mobility Edge mobile computers will use Optoroâs cloud-based data-driven solution to help retailers better manage returned purchases and excess inventory. Optoroâs proprietary algorithms help to determine how to dispose ofÂ a returned item to get maximum value. HON didnât disclose the financial aspects of this collaboration.

The latest data from the National Retail Federation suggests that returns from consumers have been growing every year, and retailers estimate that more than 10% of their annual sales are returned.

Peter Howes, Honeywellâs president for Productivity Products business, said, âReverse logistics is becoming a complex challenge for retailers as they need to move returned goods within the supply chain as quickly as possible to reduce bottom-line impact. With Optoro running on our Mobility Edge Platform devices, retailers can quickly connect returns with best available opportunities to turn the products into revenue.â

## Stock price movement

Honeywell stock gained 2.0% and closed at $137.36 for the week ending January 11, 2019. The gains helped HON to narrow itsÂ 100-day moving average gap. The stock traded 6.7% below the 100-day moving average price of $147.19. Honeywell underperformed the Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA), which gained 3.8%. PPA invests 7.0% of its portfolio in Honeywell.

So far in 2019, Honeywell has gained 5.0%. United Technologies (UTX), Textron (TXT), and Boeing (BA) have risen 4.4%, 5.2%, and 11.5%, respectively. The companyâs 14-day RSI (relative strength index) is at 53, which indicates that the stock isnât overbought or oversold. An RSI of 70 and above shows that a stock has temporarily moved into the âoverboughtâ position, while an RSI of 30 and below indicates that a stock has temporarily moved into the âoversoldâ position.

## General Electric shares

General Electric (GE) shares rose ~3.8% during after-hours trade on January 4. Bloomberg reported that private equity firm Apollo Global Management is working on an offer to bid for General Electricâs aircraft leasing operations. However, citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg said that General Electric hasnât agreed to a deal with Apollo yet.

Under General Electricâs jet-leasing operations, GECAS (GE Capital Aviation Services), the company provides planes to airlines on long-term leases. Currently, GECAS has a fleet of over 1,900 aircraft. According to Bloombergâs report, the business unit is valued at $40 billion. The companyâs GECAS business is a unit of General Electricâs capital segment.

Apolloâs bid for GECAS has come at a time when General Electric CEO Larry Culp is speeding up the restructuring process. The restructuring process includes divesting and spinning off certain assets to lower debt, enhance liquidity, and restore profits.Â General Electric reported a loss of $22.8 billion in the third quarter. General Electric ended the quarter with a debt of $115 billion on its balance sheet. The company reported negative free cash flows in all three of the quarters in 2018.

If the deal materializes between General Electric and Apollo, it could help General Electric drastically lower its debt. However, Culp will have to decide on Apolloâs offer. GECAS is one of General Electricâs profitable and fast-growing business units. GECAS complements General Electricâs aviation business segment, which is the companyâs most profitable segment.

## Restructuring initiatives

General Electric has focused on divestment and spin-off options to optimize its business, strengthen the balance sheet, and shore up cash. In November, General Electric divested its current business unit, sold $4 billion worth of its stake in Baker Hughes (BHGE), and sold $1.4 billion worth of its healthcare equipment finance portfolio. In December, General Electric filed for an IPO for its healthcare unit.

Although the restructuring initiatives are at a very nascent stage, the pace at which Culp has been implementing them has helped the stock gain investor and analystsâ confidence in the past month. Major research firms including JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Vertical Research upgraded their ratings on the stockÂ in December.

In 2018, General Electric stock was the worst performer in the industrial sector (XLI) due to concerns about its severe liquidity crisis, increasing losses, and negative cash flows. The stock lost 56.6% of its value in 2018. Honeywell International (HON) and United Technologies (UTX) shares fell 5.6% and 6.4%, respectively."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/455a13ee-e4a8-3e91-a1b9-3a2e22ccb8c3/general-electric-gains%2C.html?.tsrc=rss

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Attractive valuation

Last yearâs ~57% plunge in General Electric (GE) stock has made its valuation attractive in the industrial sector. At current market prices, GE trades at a PE ratio of 9.96x, a significant discount to the industrial sectorâs (XLI) PE ratio of 24.32x.

The stock also trades at a lower PE multiple to its top peers. The companyâs main competitors such as Honeywell International (HON), 3M Company (MMM), and United Technologies (UTX) are trading at PE multiples of 16.77x, 19.50x, and 14.65x, respectively.

Furthermore, based on analystsâ next-12-month earnings projections, GE is trading at a discount to competitors. Forward PE ratios for GE, HON, MMM, and UTX are pegged at 8.91x, 16.70x, 17.68x, and 13.71x, respectively.

The PE valuation multiple is used widely because of its simplicity, but the measurement has some flaws. For example, earnings of a company can be easily manipulated, thus making the ratio meaningless. Therefore, weâll compare these companies based on EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) multiple.

Currently, GE has an EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 31.54x, which is higher than HON, MMM, and UTXâs EV-to-EBITDA multiple of 10.87x 15.10x, and 10.87x, respectively. However, based on analystsâ next-12-month EBITDA estimates, GE is trading at a discounted EV-to-EBITDA multiple against HON and MMM, while at a premium to UTX. Forward EV-to-EBITDA ratios of GE, HON, MMM, and UTX are pegged at 9.40x, 11.85x, 12.38x, and 8.71x, respectively.

## Analystsâ rating and target price

GE has received a consensus âholdâ recommendation from analysts polled by Reuters. Of the 20 analysts tracking the stock, four recommended a âstrong buy,â five recommended a âbuy,â nine recommended a âhold,â and the remaining two recommended a âstrong sell.â

Analysts have lowered their target price and EPS estimates for General Electric since its third-quarter results. The stockâs current 12-month consensus target price of $12.37 is ~20% lower than its target price of $15.50 on October 30, the day it reported its third-quarter results.

The mean estimate for GEâs 2018 EPS fell to $0.71 from $0.83 on October 30. The companyâs 2019 EPS estimate has been revised downward to $0.85 from $0.93.

Similarly, CATâs cost of goods sold (or COGS) as a percentage of its sales is also expected to fall.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/abb6c9cc-62c0-3ee4-8a9b-e857a492dd35/can-cat-keep-up-the-trend-of.html?.tsrc=rss

GE Investors Deserve More Straight Talk	If it's reallyÂ out with the old at John Flannery's GE, then its arcane and vague approach to reporting earnings needs to go.  Flannery has rolled out  a bold transformation  plan to shrink General Electric Co.'s eight major business units  to four and  vanquish the bureaucracy that's been stifling the 126-year-old conglomerate.  Many assumed this refresh would include a shift to reporting earnings per share on a GAAP basis, or something close to it, but Flannery's  purportedly improved method of reporting GE's profit is just as disjointed as that of his predecessors.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/34b52dda-8436-30df-b3c1-6b3557fe8386/ge-investors-deserve-more.html?.tsrc=rss

Honeywell  increased its 2018 earnings guidance in April and all of its main businesses are expected to see organic growth and improvements in already high margins.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/16be74cf-12fb-3476-a6fb-79a5a8fc5059/in-the-same-league-as-ge%3F.html?.tsrc=rss

[$$] U.S. Companies Wind Down Iran Business After Nuclear Deal Pullout	Dozens of major American companies are preparing to pull out of Iran as the Trump administration closes a narrow legal window that has allowed firms to operate there without violating U.S. sanctions.

Some of the companies have already booked millions of dollars in revenue from their Iranian business, underscoring the high commercial stakes of the Trump administrationâs decision to revive economy-crippling sanctions against Iran.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/202ac435-5fad-3696-953a-bfb3b7b42301/%5B%24%24%5D-u.s.-companies-wind-down.html?.tsrc=rss
