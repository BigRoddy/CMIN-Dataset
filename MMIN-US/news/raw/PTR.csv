2021-01-26	2021-01-26 09:03:25	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Tencent Shares Tumble After Approaching $1 Trillion Valuation	(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. slumped after a world-beating surge in the stock pushed its market value to the cusp of $1 trillion for the first time.The Chinese Internet behemoth lost 6.3% in Hong Kong on Tuesday, putting its market capitalization below $890 billion. Traders took profit after Monday’s 11% rally, which was Tencent’s biggest in almost a decade. Adding to the caution were comments by an adviser to China’s central bank at a conference, reported by local media, indicating that excessive liquidity was creating asset bubbles.Read more: China Asset-Bubble Warning Threatens Stock Frenzy in Hong KongThousands of bullish Tencent options lost almost all their value, after some surged as much as 118,300% on Monday. The frenzy in derivatives trading pushed the cost of one-month Tencent options to the highest since March 2014 relative to those tracking the Hong Kong benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The prospect that China will tighten funding conditions threatens to derail Tencent’s stock rally, which has been underpinned by a relentless flow of capital from the mainland. Onshore funds have purchased a record amount of Hong Kong shares this month, with about a quarter of that targeting Tencent. As more than a billion people use its WeChat social-media platform, Tencent is ubiquitous to Chinese investors who have no access to Hong Kong shares of rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. through the trading links.Tencent was the most recent mega-cap company to benefit from investor enthusiasm for the tech sector, with its looming milestone a marker for the euphoria sweeping the stocks globally. Before Tuesday, the stock had added $251 billion in January alone -- by far the biggest creation of shareholder wealth worldwide. Warnings are rising that easy monetary policy is fueling bubbles in global equities, especially in the U.S., where gains have been led by the Nasdaq.As investors seek cheaper alternatives, they’ve been piling into Hong Kong equities. That’s helped make the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index one of the world’s best-performing benchmarks in the past month.While Tencent has long been an investor favorite in Asia, returning more than 100,000% since its 2004 initial public offering as of Monday, there are other risks to the rally.In 2018, a government crackdown on China’s online gaming industry squeezed Tencent’s most profitable business, which at the time accounted for about 40% of its revenue. Coupled with a slowing Chinese economy and a weakening yuan, Beijing’s nine-month halt on approvals for new games contributed to a 22% slump in the shares.A campaign against monopolistic practices since late last year has targeted many of the industries in which Tencent and rival Alibaba operate, including the online payments industry. But while increasing regulatory risk has left Alibaba’s shares about 18% lower than their October peak, Tencent has closed at a record in seven of the past nine sessions.Tencent would be the second Chinese firm to join the trillion-dollar club after PetroChina Co., which was briefly worth more than that in late 2007 before collapsing in value. U.S. tech giants Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are also worth more than $1 trillion each, as is Saudi Arabian Oil Co.Tencent was founded in 1998 by four college classmates and a friend from Shenzhen who devised a Chinese version of the instant messaging service ICQ. Led by “Pony” Ma Huateng -- ma is Chinese for “horse” -- the company’s chat software became the primary communication tool for a generation of young Chinese.Tencent’s surge has outpaced all but the most bullish analysts’ forecasts.

2021-01-04	2021-01-04 11:07:02	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	China Oil Majors May Be U.S. Target After Telcos Delisting	(Bloomberg) -- Chinese oil majors may be next in line for delisting in the U.S. after the New York Stock Exchange said last week it would remove the Asian nation’s three biggest telecom companies.China’s largest offshore oil producer Cnooc Ltd. could be most at risk as it’s on the Pentagon’s list of companies it says are owned or controlled by Chinese military, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Henik Fung. PetroChina Co. and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp., also known as Sinopec, may also be under threat as the energy sector is crucial to China’s military, he said.“More Chinese companies could get delisted in the U.S. and the oil majors could come as the next wave,” said Steven Leung, executive director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. At the same time, the impact of removing the telecom firms is probably minimal as they were thinly traded in the U.S. and they haven’t raised much funds there, he said.A Sinopec spokesperson declined to comment. Cnooc and PetroChina didn’t immediately comment, although Cnooc said in a Hong Kong exchange filing that it was not aware of any reasons for the “unusual” drop in its share price Monday. Cnooc fell 1.8% Monday while PetroChina was unchanged. Sinopec rose 1.7%.The three firms are mostly traded in Hong Kong, although they each have American depositary receipts listed in New York. Trading volumes are much higher in Hong Kong, according to exchange data. Cnooc’s ADRs fell 1.8% at 6:05 a.m. New York time in premarket trading, while PetroChina and Sinopec hadn’t traded.“The bottom line is the impact will be very limited,” said Neil Beveridge, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in Hong Kong. “Most institutional investors invest through the Hong Kong shares rather than the U.S. ADRs. The biggest downside for investors would be the loss of transparency from SEC filings.”Cnooc’s appearance on the Pentagon list is possibly due to its drilling activity in the fraught South China Sea, said Leo Ho, an analyst with Daiwa Capital Markets. If that’s the case, PetroChina and Sinopec would be at less risk of U.S. action, he said.The NYSE said it would delist the telecom operators to comply with a U.S. executive order imposing restrictions on companies identified as affiliated with the Chinese military. China Mobile Ltd., China Telecom Corp Ltd. and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. would all be suspended from trading between Jan. 7 and Jan. 11, and proceedings to delist them have started, the exchange said.Read more: China’s Three Big Telcos Slide on NYSE Move to Delist SharesU.S. President Donald Trump signed an order in November barring American investments in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military in a bid to pressure Beijing over what it views as abusive business practices.

Kunlun shares surged on the news.Kunlun Energy Co. will sell a 60% stake in a Beijing natural gas pipeline and a 75% stake in its Dalian LNG company for 40.9 billion yuan to the new state-owned firm known as PipeChina, according to a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Kunlun Energy is a PetroChina Co. subsidiary that owns the majority of a gas pipeline feeding Beijing, as well as LNG import infrastructure.China Oil & Gas Pipeline Network Corp. is part of an effort by President Xi Jinping’s government to consolidate the nation’s major pipelines and other midstream facilities into a single firm, intended to boost competition among drillers and downstream oil and gas sellers. The entity officially started operations in October.The sale values the Kunlun Energy assets at a 90% premium to book value, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in an emailed note, while Daiwa Capital Markets pegged the premium at 97%. Both brokerages said the valuation exceeded market expectations.Kunlun shares rose 11% in Hong Kong Wednesday to HK$7.14, the highest close in more than a year.In July, PipeChina reached an agreement with PetroChina and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. to give them $56 billion in cash and shares for pipelines, storage tanks, LNG terminals and other facilities.In the deal announced after market hours Tuesday PipeChina will pay for the Kunlun Energy assets in cash in two installments, PetroChina said in the stock market filing. The agreement also needs approval from authorities.Kunlun expects to receive about 37 billion yuan in cash from the deal, and will spend half of it on a special dividend, 40% for developing its city gas utility business and 10% to pay down debt, the company said in a Hong Kong exchange filing. Morgan Stanley estimates this breakdown gives the firm nearly 15 billion yuan for city gas acquisitions, substantially ahead of peers’ spending plans.(Updates with share price in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-pipeline-giant-buy-kunlun-012803374.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-01	2020-12-01 10:00:04	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Even Exxon Mobil Is Capitulating to Peak Oil Demand	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Et tu, Exxon?Through all the shifts that have swept through the oil market in recent years, one thing has been a reliable constant: Exxon Mobil Corp. has remained resolute in its bullishness about the future of crude. In stark contrast to European competitors who've speculated about a peak in oil demand and switched investments toward renewables, Chairman Darren Woods has kept on preaching that old-time religion.The pullback by rivals shouldn’t be seen as a harbinger of doom for crude, but as an opportunity to spend more aggressively, Woods said at an investor day in March: “The best time to invest in these businesses is during a low, which will lead to greater value capture in the coming upswing.” Internal documents reviewed by Bloomberg Green earlier this year showed the company planned to increase its annual emissions 17% by 2025. Now even this most reliable of oil bulls seems to be having doubts. Exxon Mobil’s natural gas fields will be written down by as much as $20 billion, the company said Monday. More tellingly, those counter-cyclical spending plans are being marked to market. Annual capital investment through 2025 will be in the range of $20 billion to $25 billion, some $10 billion below the level that Woods forecast in March.That still sounds like a pretty substantial number — but when considered in the context of the wells Exxon Mobil is already operating, it looks markedly smaller. Depreciation, depletion and amortization is already running in the region of $20 billion every year. Subtract that amount, and you’re left with a growth capex figure of $5 billion a year at best, or zero at worst.Exxon Mobil likes to point to forecasts that the world will need new oil supplies to increase by 8% a year in the near term to meet rising demand as existing fields decline, with new gas requirements rising 6% a year, too. Its newly modest spending plans aren’t going to be sufficient to meet that scenario, let alone increase its own market share.In capitulating to a more subdued outlook, Exxon Mobil is simply following where other companies have led. It’s the only one of the big seven independent oil majors where analysts’ expectations of depreciation don’t already outstrip capital spending over the three years through 2022.Even if you look at the three years through 2023 to exclude the extreme circumstances of the current pandemic-hit year, BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and ConocoPhillips aren’t expected to spend enough to keep up with depreciation. Across the seven large independent oil companies, the deficit will amount to $4.82 billion. Investments in renewables by the likes of Equinor ASA and Shell are still too small to take a substantial chunk out of the industry’s petroleum-focused capex, but they certainly don’t help. Oil giants are divesting from petroleum as fast as any climate-focused fund manager.The same logic applies when you extend things further, to the listed national oil companies. Thanks to a $19 billion cut in capital spending by China’s big three oil majors this year and rising charges resulting from their spending splurge in previous periods, PetroChina Co. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, will be markedly more restrained in their investments in the years ahead. Growth capex totals of $3.18 billion and negative $4.76 billion respectively will be invested in the three years through 2022, based on analyst estimates.Petroleo Brasileiro SA, still recovering from a splurge in the early part of this decade, will reduce its net investments by $6.8 billion over the period. Equinor, aiming at a target of net zero emissions by 2050, will see depreciation exceed capex by about $656 million.Put together, the result looks like an oil industry that stopped spending four years ago and is showing no appetite to start again. Aggregate growth capex across a group of seven large independent and six national oil companies with adequate data will be a negative $23.8 billion this year and minus $6.77 billion next year. Even in 2022, when the sector as a whole should return to a measure of growth, the total will be about $8.8 billion — less than half the amount spent by Exxon Mobil alone in 2014.Oil gets used up quickly, so if the industry doesn’t spend, production will slump in short order. If investment continues at 2020 levels, supply will be 9 million barrels lower than forecast as soon as 2025, according to the International Energy Agency — equivalent to roughly 10% of the current oil market.It’s still probably too early to read oil majors’ miserliness as an indication that they expect demand to fall at quite that pace. The risks of under-investment are relatively limited, as long as everyone moves at the same time. If the world ends up seriously short of crude five years from now, they’ll end up raking in profits that can be recycled on belatedly plugging the deficit.Still, borrowing costs for investment-grade energy companies right now are the lowest they’ve been in six years. If oil majors were half as confident about the future of their core product as they claim to be, they’d be preparing to spend with abandon. When even Exxon Mobil closes its check book, the industry’s future looks truly doubtful.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2020-11-20	2020-11-20 14:21:55	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	CNPC, CNOOC Weigh Deal for Exxon’s Iraq Oil Field Stake	(Bloomberg) -- China’s oil giants China National Petroleum Corp. and CNOOC Ltd. are considering acquiring Exxon Mobil Corp.’s remaining stake in an oil field in Iraq, which could fetch at least $500 million, according to people familiar with the matter.A deal would mark Exxon’s exit from the project and a further retreat from Iraq by international oil majors, following Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s departure from the giant Majnoon field three years ago. Tough contractual terms, payment delays and political instability have dulled the appeal of what had once been the Middle East’s glittering oil prize.“Iraq has not proved as attractive as it was hoped to be a decade ago,” said Richard Bronze, co-founder of consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. “U.S and European firms are not pursuing those big upstream opportunities -- which is bad news for Iraq’s further expansion plans. Chinese firms are, by contrast, still interested.”CNPC an CNOOC, both state-owned, are weighing a potential deal to buy Exxon’s 32.7% stake in Iraq’s West Qurna 1 field, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private.No final decisions have been made and there is no guarantee the deliberations will lead to a deal, the people said. Geopolitical risks in Iraq could bring uncertainties to any potential agreement, they added. Representatives for CNOOC, Exxon and CNPC declined to comment.Exxon’s departure from the field, where it was once the dominant player and remains the lead contractor, would throw into further doubt a major water-injection project seen as critical for growing Iraq’s production capacity. The U.S. company has been in talks over the common seawater supply project for southern oil fields, which has encountered multiple delays.While the government in Baghdad made enormous progress in rebuilding its war-scarred oil industry in the last decade -- effectively doubling output between 2010 and 2015 despite an Islamist insurgency and other challenges -- it has repeatedly been forced to push back its loftiest production goals.The country was pumping about 4.8 million barrels a day last September, just before a new round of supply cuts agreed with fellow members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. It aims to reach 7 million barrels a day by 2027, Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar said last month.In 2010, Exxon signed an agreement with Iraq’s state-owned South Oil Co. to rehabilitate and redevelop the West Qurna oil field. Three years later, Exxon reduced its holding by selling a stake to PetroChina, CNPC’s listed unit, and to PT Pertamina. Itochu Corp. acquired Shell’s 19.6% stake in the field in 2018.Iraq awarded a contract to develop the West Qurna oilfield to Exxon and Shell in 2009. The oilfield is one of the world’s largest with expected recoverable reserves of over 20 billion barrels, according to Itochu’s website.

2020-11-10	2020-11-10 03:17:03	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	China Ready to Pick Up Slack With Global Oil Demand Wavering	(Bloomberg) -- As a rampant coronavirus ravages Europe and the U.S. and raises the risk of more lockdown measures, a range of indicators suggest China can cushion oil markets from the worst of the potential demand destruction.Stockpiles of crude and particularly fuels such as diesel and gasoline in the world’s biggest oil importer have shrunk over the past couple of months as economic activity exceeded expectations. Against this backdrop, one of China’s biggest state-owned refiners said it will keep crude throughput at its plants steady for the rest of the year.The nation’s independents -- accounting for around a quarter of refining capacity -- also look set for a revival. While buying by the so-called teapots has dropped since July, it’s expected to pick up again after import quotas for next year were raised. Weak margins remain a concern, however, although authorities have reactivated a minimum fuel-price mechanism that should help safeguard the processors and encourage more buying.See also: It’s Asia to the Rescue Again as Oil Demand Wavers ElsewhereWhile news of a potential virus vaccine breakthrough spurred a surge in oil prices on Monday, the demand outlook over the northern hemisphere winter still looks pretty shaky. These five charts show why developments in China mean oil traders and investors can breathe a little bit easier.China’s crude stockpiles started growing in early February as the pandemic crippled the economy, and got a further boost a few months later from a flurry of buying to take advantage of the crash in global prices. The inventories are coming down now, however, which means refiners will have some leeway to import more without worrying about storage constraints.Stockpiles peaked at 914 million barrels, or 73% of capacity, in the week to Oct. 2, according to Ursa Space Systems, a company that uses synthetic aperture radar to track 39 oil storage sites in China. They’ve since fallen to 885 million barrels, or 71% of capacity, in the week through Nov. 5.The magnitude of the drop in fuel inventories looks even more encouraging. Gasoline and diesel stockpiles peaked at 71.14% and 60.67% of capacity, respectively, in the week through Sept. 4, according to Oilchem, a Chinese energy and petrochemical information provider that’s part of Mysteel Group. They’ve since shrunk to 53.91% and 50.72% at the end of October.The flurry of buying by teapots helped global oil prices recover rapidly after their plunge in April. Purchases have been slowing since around the middle of the year, though, with congestion at ports holding up deliveries and the independent refineries running low on import quota.The Ministry of Commerce’s announcement last week that it would raise the quota for next year by more than 20% came as welcome news to the market. Oil traders had already been buying up cargoes since early October and sending them toward China, in anticipation of an uptick in purchases for 2021.Weak refining margins are a source of vulnerability in the Chinese oil demand picture, however. After rising as high as 1,170 yuan ($176.82) a ton in late April, teapot profits then dropped rapidly and have been hovering around zero since the middle of the year, according to data from consultant Energy Aspects.Chinese authorities said last week that they would reintroduce a floor-price mechanism that will hold fuel prices at a level that’s the equivalent of $40 a barrel crude. The measure aided margins and helped drive buying earlier in the year when oil prices crashed.The nation’s refining heavyweights -- China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. and PetroChina Co. -- also look set to do their bit to aid global demand. China is on track to import 550 million tons of crude this year, around 10% more than 2019, China Petroleum & Chemical, also known as Sinopec, said on Sunday.PetroChina said in mid-October that it wouldn’t cut overall throughput at its refiners in the fourth quarter. Sinopec is on track to reach its 2020 full-year refining target of 241 million tons, said an official at the company’s press office. That would mean fourth-quarter throughput would be around 5% higher than in the previous three months, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Sinopec public filings for the first nine months of the year.(Updates with comment from Sinopec in final paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-ready-pick-slack-global-031703315.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-25	2020-10-25 22:00:12	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Zero Hour Is Coming for Emissions. Believe It	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s only natural to be skeptical when a political leader stands up and makes a promise about a target that’s far off, hard to achieve, and lacks a clear pathway.So one reaction to a report that Japan’s new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, will pledge next week to reduce the country’s net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 might be: Really?After all, public and private Japanese banks are still funding new coal-fired power stations in Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh, exploiting a loophole in Tokyo’s previous promise to reduce financing to such projects — a fact that’s causing some consternation among European investment funds.For all the publicity garnered by South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s Green New Deal and pledge last month of a 2050 net zero target, Korean engineering companies, too, are working with Japanese funders on Vietnam’s Vung Ang 2 coal plant.Chinese President Xi Jinping also garnered plenty of positive headlines last month for promising to bring the world’s largest emitter to net zero status by 2060 — but China still has 250 gigawatts of coal plants under development, more than the total existing fleets in India or the U.S.Doubts are warranted when so many nations are falling far short of their own climate pledges. At the same time, it can be pushed too far. The promises of political leaders have real-world effects that we’re already seeing. On the path to getting the binding and comprehensive emissions policies that the world needs, there will be plenty of partial, vague and unenforceable pledges. Each of them, though, sets a new baseline that will help create the conditions for further, more ambitious policies.Take the broadly accepted target that the world must stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide at or below 450 parts per million. Until relatively recently, this was generally considered the most radical reasonable option.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2001 synthesis of scientific research took 450ppm as the lower bound of a range of outcomes stretching up to 750ppm. The influential 2006 U.K. government review of the economics of climate change by Nicholas Stern advised aiming for 500ppm to 550ppm. That ambition was considered bold at the time but is now accepted as grossly inadequate. Similarly, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius was rarely treated as a serious option until the 2015 Paris Agreement set a target “well below 2 degrees Celsius” at the behest of small island states that risk destruction from higher levels of warming.What target skeptics miss is the feedback relationship between the stated goals of political leaders and the behavior of investors, engineers and lower-level officials whose work will help decarbonize the economy.As should be obvious from the $3.5 billion a year spent on lobbying in the U.S. alone, the decisions of political leaders shape the field of what’s possible for businesses. When a politician embraces a net-zero ambition — and especially when, as in the European Union, those words are enshrined into law — the risks associated with carbon-intensive projects go up, while those associated with low-carbon technologies go down. That's particularly the case when, as we’re seeing, the path starts to be followed by leaders in multiple countries. Lower-carbon approaches then become more viable. That shift in the technological frontier in turn makes it easier for politicians to set still bolder targets, because the political and economic costs of doing so have declined.We’re seeing this sort of virtuous circle playing out. As we’ve written, the best guide to the path of power sector emissions in the 2010s wasn’t the International Energy Agency’s politics-as-usual scenario, but the one where radical action was taken to limit atmospheric carbon to 450ppm. Just over a month ago, I greeted PetroChina Co.’s announcement of a 2050 “near-zero” emissions target by fretting that China may be more addicted to coal than oil. That’s still a reasonable concern, but Xi’s 2060 net zero promise two weeks after that column drastically changes the landscape. Within weeks of that speech, influential Chinese academic research institutes have already released a range of roadmaps that would illustrate how to put those words into action, with coal falling from nearly 70% of primary energy at present to 10% or less in 2050.Any targets laid out by politicians will find themselves up against institutional inertia, unintended consequences and political pushback. That doesn’t make them worthless. Political rhetoric changes reality, and even a cursory examination of recent history shows you how quickly that can happen. Not one question was asked on the subject of climate during the 2016 U.S. presidential debates. This year, it’s been one of the most-discussed topics.Turning round an oil tanker takes time. That doesn't mean it’s impossible. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2020-09-06	2020-09-06 00:00:41	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Beijing May Be More Addicted to Coal Than Oil	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There’s one surprise entrant in the group of oil companies announcing plans this year for how they’ll reduce emissions: PetroChina Co.China’s oil companies, unlike their peers in the U.S. and particularly Europe, don’t traditionally treat climate targets as a major issue. Beijing, after all, isn’t even promising to hit its emissions peak until 2030.The large fund managers that have been pressuring Western oil companies to improve their carbon commitments don’t make much difference, either. PetroChina’s chairman, Dai Houliang, is a Communist bureaucrat whose more significant job is party secretary of state-owned parent China National Petroleum Corp. His main role at PetroChina is to make sure it plays its part in guaranteeing energy security, one of Beijing’s most critical issues. As shareholders will no doubt be bitterly aware, their interests are neither here nor there:So PetroChina’s announcement in its half-year results last week that it would seek a “near-zero” target for emissions by 2050 is unexpected. With China preparing its 14th five-year plan — probably the most crucial document in determining whether the planet can avoid devastating climate change — that might be taken as a sign that the winds of change are blowing through Beijing.It’s probably best not to get too excited, though. In most countries, the chief objective is to minimize reliance on the worst-polluting of fossil fuels: coal. In China, however, bureaucrats are more preoccupied with self-sufficiency, so limiting oil imports is a bigger concern. In that sense, PetroChina’s announcement may just be further confirmation that it’s national security considerations, rather than climate, that’s driving energy policy in Zhongnanhai.Have a look at what’s happening to PetroChina’s core business and it’s obvious why the company may have other reasons for pivoting to renewables. Oil output from its domestic wells has been more or less flat for four years, despite strong demand growth. While gas production has increased in line with government policy, the cost has been enormous, as we’ve written: Three-year average all-in finding and development costs for its petroleum wells are running at $21.74 a barrel, well above most Western oil majors. PetroChina isn’t alone in this. Getting more hydrocarbons out of China’s unpromising soil has been getting harder for some time. Despite domestic demand increasing by about a third between 2015 and 2019, production from local wells fell 11%. As a result, the country went from importing 31% of its crude in 2002 to 72% last year, at a cost of some $220 billion.There’s no shortage of policy ambition to reduce this dependence. China has some of the world’s most generous and long-standing subsidies for electric vehicles, nearly half the world’s electric car fleet and about 99% of its electric buses. Concerns that a rival power could turn off the lights by blockading the Strait of Malacca in the event of war also appear to have driven the construction of a multibillion-dollar pipeline to the coast of Myanmar.Coal is a very different picture. Thanks to vast domestic reserves and demand that’s down about 9.2% since peaking in 2013, China has consistently been able to source around 95% of its solid carbon domestically. Just last year it completed a 1,814 kilometer (1,127 mile) railway to shift soot south from its main mining regions north and west of Beijing toward destinations further south, which have traditionally been dependent on imports. Premier Li Keqiang has repeatedly promoted “cleaner and more efficient use of coal” in speeches about the country’s energy policy.Solid fuel still has problems in China. The gradual deregulation of the country’s power market is resulting in spot prices in key provinces far below costs for coal-fired power stations, according to BloombergNEF analyst Hanyang Wei — though their dependence on long-term power purchase contracts will soften that blow for a while. Despite having some 98.5 gigawatts of new coal-fired power stations under construction, the generation sector has been plagued with overcapacity for years, too. As a whole, the country’s fleet runs less than half the time, levels at which it’s hard to turn a profit. Nonetheless, in contrast to China’s relatively strong government policies to limit oil demand, coal remains a favored sector.That’s a tragic mistake. If China is worried about energy security, there’s no type of power less import-dependent than renewables. More to the point, emissions are a present and future danger to the Chinese people. Some 47,240 lives each year have been saved by a crackdown on particulate emissions between 2013 and 2017, according to one study. The devastation wrought by this summer’s flooding of the Yangtze is a small foretaste of what's to come in a future where higher global temperatures lead to heavier, more damaging rainfall episodes.PetroChina’s near-zero ambition may be less than meets the eye. Its peers in the state-owned coal and power sector would still do well to match — and exceed — it.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2020-08-18	2020-08-18 05:28:18	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	China Ramps Up U.S. Oil Purchases Before Trade Deal Review	(Bloomberg) -- China, the world’s biggest oil importer, has ramped up purchases of American crude in the lead-up to a highly-anticipated review of the trade deal between the two economic powerhouses.As much as 14 million barrels -- or seven super-class tankers full -- of U.S. oil will be loaded next month for delivery to China, according to estimates by Vortexa Ltd. based on provisional tanker bookings. If all those shipments make the trip that will be more than double the volumes set for August.The surge in bookings comes before a review of the phase-one trade deal, under which China pledged to boost purchases of U.S. energy products. The talks, which were originally planned for last weekend, have been delayed indefinitely, however, amid deteriorating relations between the two countries.Chinese imports of U.S. goods in the first six months of the year only reached about 23% of the total target under the trade agreement for 2020, Bloomberg calculations based on data from General Administration of Customs show. The nation’s refineries have been cranking up run rates as the economy emerges from a virus-induced slump, which may be another reason for the boost in buying.“The rise in U.S. crude purchases is likely politically driven,” said Serena Huang, a senior analyst at Vortexa, a market analytics firm. “China is still sitting on large stockpiles of oil, and current U.S. crude prices are not much more favorable than their Middle East competitors.”Oil-refining heavyweights PetroChina Co. and Sinopec chartered more than 40% of the China-bound supertankers set for September loading as of Aug. 17, Vortexa’s data show. Grades such as WTI Midland and Mars were among the types of American oil purchased by China, but they weren’t always cheaper than alternative feedstock from other regions, according to traders.A Beijing-based Sinopec official at the company’s press office and an official at China National Petroleum Corp., parent company of PetroChina, both declined to comment on the matter.China bought an average about 568,500 tons, or 4.2 million barrels, of U.S. oil a month in May and June, General Administration of China Customs data show. The country imported no American oil for the previous five months as relations between the two countries deteriorated amid the coronavirus.China’s energy demand has rebounded in-line with an uptick in its economy, said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit. “These new orders for U.S. crude will help to improve China’s overall progress toward the U.S.-China phase one trade deal targets,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-ramps-u-oil-purchases-052818715.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-24	2020-07-24 09:36:17	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	China Oil Giants Get Premiums in $56 Billion Pipeline Accord	(Bloomberg) -- China’s biggest oil and gas companies finalized deals worth $56 billion to sell their pipeline networks to a new national carrier at premiums to their book value, a long-awaited step that’s being seen as a boost for investors.PetroChina Co. will get 1.2 times book value for assets including pipelines, storage and import terminals while Sinopec will get 1.4 times in the deals. The premium valuations are likely to put to rest investor concerns over whether the state-mandated deal would compensate the companies properly for their extensive networks and reward shareholders.The agreements also create a 500 billion yuan ($71 billion) national carrier known as the China Oil & Gas Pipeline Network Corp. that will be at the center of reform efforts by President Xi Jinping’s government to boost domestic energy production and distribution in the world’s top consumer.“We see these announcements as positive for the companies as the valuations are market friendly,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts including Neil Beveridge said in a note, adding that both companies are likely to issue special dividends. PipeChina’s capitalization “would make it one of the largest pipeline companies in the world should it come to market,” they wrote.As part of the deals announced Tuesday, PetroChina will receive consideration totaling 268.7 billion yuan, which includes a 29.9% stake in PipeChina and 119 billion in cash, according to the filings and an analysis by Morgan Stanley, which upgraded its rating on the stock.Sinopec, known officially as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., will receive a total of 122.7 billion yuan, which breaks down into a 14% stake in PipeChina and 52.7 billion in cash, according to its filing.No announcement has been made yet regarding asset transfers from China National Offshore Oil Corp., the nation’s biggest liquefied natural gas importer, or Kunlun Energy Co., a PetroChina subsidiary that owns a gas pipeline and several LNG terminals.PetroChina closed 2.1% higher on Friday in Hong Kong, while Sinopec was unchanged, both paring earlier gains. Kunlun added 5.3%.As of 2015, China had 64,000 kilometers (about 40,000 miles) of pipelines carrying natural gas, 27,000 carrying crude and 21,000 carrying oil products, according to China’s main economic planning agency. Most of those are owned by PetroChina and its parent, China National Petroleum Corp.PetroChina’s dominance of the distribution network was seen as stunting the domestic drilling industry, as other firms could be blocked or have to pay prohibitively expensive fees to get their oil and gas to market. PipeChina, on the other hand, is expected to offer open access to the networks.(Updates with details in seventh paragraph and share prices in eighth.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-oil-giants-premiums-56-020233261.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-03	2020-07-03 01:12:43	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Hong Kong Brokers Are Already Reading From Beijing’s Script	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The national security law China imposed on Hong Kong this week will damage civil liberties with long jail sentences and grant  immunity to Chinese agents working in the territory. For investors who depend on the city as a financial center, though, there may be an extra sting in the tail.The law could increase self-censorship by Hong Kong’s analysts and economists, and damage the credibility of research reports, the Financial Times reported this week. The need to maintain relationships with mainland clients has influenced coverage in the past, but many fear the new law will exacerbate this trend.It’s a bit late to be worrying about that, though. Self-censorship isn’t just a matter of avoiding gratuitous digs and glib phrases. If you look at the ratings given by equity analysts in recent years, it seems to include portraying companies with strong mainland connections as better investments than they actually are.Take the 50 companies on the Hang Seng Index. You can easily break them into three groups: 15 Chinese state-owned enterprises, or SOEs, such as Bank of China Ltd. and PetroChina Ltd.; 13 civilian-controlled mainland Chinese businesses, or COEs, such as Tencent Ltd. and Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd.; and 22 other, mostly locally controlled stocks, such as HSBC Holdings Plc, CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. and AIA Group Ltd(1). Then look at the extent to which analysts’ consensus target prices have exceeded actual stock prices in recent years. SOEs get the most favorable treatment, with target prices exceeding actual prices by an average of 24% since the start of 2016, compared to 16% for the COEs and 13% for non-mainland companies.It’s not just in Hong Kong that brokers’ target prices tend to run higher than the actual market — there’s a reason they’re called sell-side analysts. China is still an emerging market, too, so it’s not impossible that its stocks simply have more upside than those operating out of a mature economy such as Hong Kong. So perhaps the reason state-owned enterprises get a target price premium over local companies is simply that they’re better investments that will deliver higher returns to investors?If only. Thanks to booming tech and biotech stocks and the huge run-up in prices during 2017, civilian-owned Chinese companies did achieve pretty stunning average total returns of 31% over the past four-and-a-half years. SOEs, however, averaged a measly 1.9%, far less than the 6.1% achieved by the non-mainland stocks.It’s not totally irrational that possessing a wealthy patron should be seen as an advantage for some investments. The Chinese state tends to put its thumb heavily on the scales in favor of its own organs, with diminishing benefits the further you get from the commanding heights of the economy, as my colleague Shuli Ren has written.In particular, it’s logical for credit analysts to give state-owned enterprises a better rating than those that can’t count on the backing of the Chinese government to bail them out. Even there, you’ve not been paying attention if you think the interests of private bondholders are going to be treated equally with those of better-connected investors.Still, when looking at the equity market, the proof should be in the pudding. If analysts predict a stock will consistently outperform — as they tend to do in relation to SOEs — then it should do that. If not, they’re either bad at their jobs or misleading their clients.There are many things to worry about in Hong Kong’s new national security law. The integrity of equity research is probably not one of them. Sell-side brokers themselves gave that away long ago.(1) We've equal-weighted each of these baskets of stocks so that a few stocks with huge market caps like Tencent, HSBC or China Construction Bank don't skew the overall result.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2020-06-28	2020-06-28 00:00:44	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Saudi Aramco's Dividend Math Doesn't Add Up	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s the mother of all payouts.The $75 billion that Saudi Aramco doles out in dividends every year dwarfs what any other listed company gives to shareholders. It’s roughly equivalent to the payouts from Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Chevron Corp., BP Plc, Total SA, PetroChina Co., Eni SpA, Petroleo Brasiliero SA and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. or Sinopec — put together.That makes Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser’s promise to continue that level of returns for the next five years an extraordinary vote of confidence in an oil market awash with uncertainties. Saudi Aramco will be prepared to borrow money to ensure that it meets its commitment this year despite oil prices heading into negative territory, he said this month.Running up debts to keep the dividend on track is standard practice for energy companies amid the carnage of 2020’s oil market — except for those, like Shell, which plan to cut payouts altogether. You only want to fund dividends out of borrowings, though, if you’re certain it’ll be a strictly temporary measure. The risk for Aramco is that upholding such a long-term promise to shareholders will bend its entire business out of shape, just when it needs to be especially nimble as crude demand slows and goes into reverse. The core of Aramco’s profitability is its astonishingly low production costs, with operating expenses amounting to not much more than $8 a barrel of oil and equivalent products last year. It’s remarkable how quickly the spending adds up, though. Royalties paid to the Saudi state alone added another $10 a barrel or so, while corporate income tax came to around $19 a barrel and dividends swallowed a further $15. Once all those tolls were paid, Aramco didn’t have a lot of spare change left out of $60-a-barrel oil, let alone the stuff in the $40-a-barrel range it’s selling at the moment.A firm dividend policy is an unusually inflexible cost. Unlike the royalties and income taxes levied as a percentage of Aramco’s revenues and profits, payouts don’t automatically shrink if the price of crude declines. If anything, the burden per barrel rises further when prices and output fall. Perhaps in recognition of this, the Saudi state has from the start agreed to forgo its portion of any payouts to the extent that receiving them would get in the way of Umm-and-Abu investors getting their share(1). That may help maintain a theoretical $75 billion-a-year payout but it makes a nonsense of the idea that all shareholders are equal, not to mention the principle that a dividend policy is some sort of a commitment to future earnings. It’s not clear, either, why a company with this get-out clause would want to take on debt to meet its promised payments, although Aramco’s borrowing costs are essentially identical to those of the Saudi state.Dividends aren’t the end of Aramco’s committed spending. Its purchase of a majority stake in chemicals company Saudi Basic Industries Corp., or Sabic, was completed this month, committing it to about $69 billion of payments over the next six years — even after a restructured plan pushed the bulk of the cash outflow toward the middle of the decade.Then there’s a potential $15 billion investment in Reliance Industries Ltd.’s Jamnagar refinery in India, $20 billion on a separate planned chemicals venture with Sabic, plus Sabic’s own $5 billion a year or so of capital spending which will now sit on Aramco’s balance sheet.Add it all up and the picture is troubling. It’s likely to be several years before operating cash flows rise above $100 billion a year again, even with Sabic’s business consolidated. If Aramco wants to spend three-quarters of that sum on its dividend while laying out $10 billion to $15 billion annually for Sabic’s finance and investment costs, then capex on its core operations will have to fall to a third or less of the $35 billion-odd that the company was spending until recently. For all that executives are confident of their ability to increase production at very low costs, that sort of belt-tightening would make the easiest route to higher profits — lifting crude output from its pre-Covid 10 million daily barrels to around 13 million — extraordinarily difficult to achieve.That path is likely to be constrained, anyway, by several years of weak demand growth as the world recovers from Covid-19. Not to mention the fact that Aramco’s importance to the oil market rests on the proposition that increases in its output, coordinated via OPEC+, should make prices move in the opposite direction, resulting in little by way of net revenue gains for the company.Unlike most of its competitors, Saudi Aramco doesn’t really need to be so focused on dividends. All but 1.5% of its shares are held by the same state that’s hoovering up royalty and tax payments further up the income statement. Riyadh shouldn’t really care how it’s getting paid, as long as it’s getting paid.That dividend policy looks more like a swaggering attempt to hold back the tide of an oil market on the edge of terminal decline. The quicker Aramco acknowledges that, the better equipped it will be to handle the coming turmoil.(1) Americans would call them &quot;Mom-and-Pop shareholders.&quot;This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

While death rates have been easing in many countries, there’s concern the global economy may be vulnerable to a second wave of infections. China put a city near North Korea in lockdown over the weekend, while the White House has been hit with a case even as President Donald Trump encourages Americans to return to work.However, the market is showing some signs it’s starting to rebalance. China’s oil stockpiles have shrunk in recent weeks after swelling to a record, while hedge funds increased their bullish bets on West Texas Intermediate crude. U.S. output cuts are accelerating with active drill rigs falling to a level not seen since before the shale revolution kicked off at the beginning of the last decade.Oil is still down about 60% this year after global demand collapsed following lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Restrictions are slowly being eased in some places around the world, offering some hope that fuel consumption may rebound as people travel again, but low prices are still having an impact.See also: Oil Won’t Be Saved by a Return to Car-Driving: David FicklingQatar Petroleum reduced its official selling prices for April sales by 51%, the official Qatar News Agency reported, setting both of its main grades at the lowest in more than 20 years.

They also come one year after China’s state firms boosted spending to satisfy calls by President Xi to reverse the decline in oil output that raised the nation’s import dependency.“Under the current low oil price environment, the company has adjusted its operating strategy promptly and implemented more prudent investment decision-making to ensure its long-term sustainable development,” Cnooc Ltd., the country’s largest offshore producer, said in a statement.PetroChina’s shares in Shanghai on Thursday rose as much as 1.8% before paring gains to close up 1.4%. Sinopec Corp. climbed 0.5%. Their Hong Kong-listed stocks, as well as Cnooc’s, were not traded as the market is shut for a holiday.China’s drillers are particularly sensitive to lower prices because their fields are older and require more work to sustain production, according to Rystad Energy AS. The consultancy estimates the country needs oil at $41 a barrel to break even, compared with $13 for Saudi Arabia and $11 for Iraq. Brent crude, the global benchmark, was hovering above $24 a barrel.Spending CutsPetroChina plans to lower capex this year to 200 billion yuan ($28 billion), from 295 billion yuan approved earlier this year, the company said on a call with analysts, according to a research note from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Meanwhile, Sinopec will cut 20%-25% to 108 billion-115 billion yuan, Bernstein said.Neither company published the figures in their exchange filings. Sinopec declined to comment, while media representatives for PetroChina didn’t respond to a request for comment.Cnooc said in its filing that it’s targeting capital expenditure of 75 billion-85 billion yuan this year. That’s down about 11% from a previous forecast of 85 billion-95 billion yuan. It also reduced its production target to 505 million-515 million barrels of oil equivalent for the year, from a previous range of 520 million-530 million.Cnooc’s cuts will fall more heavily on international projects, but it will still reduce spending and output within China, according to the company’s earnings presentation.Specific targets for Cnooc’s cuts include Canadian oil sands and North American shale, Chief Financial Officer Xie Weizhi said on a conference call. The company will also review the staff count at its oil sands operations, Xie said. It runs the Long Lake facility in Alberta, which produces 72,000 barrels of bitumen a day, part of its 2012 purchase of Nexen Inc.PetroChina aims to maintain stable oil production and increase gas output by 5% this year, even as it sets a 30% cost-cut target for every one of its business divisions, Citigroup Inc. said in a note, citing officials on the analyst call. Management bonuses will be halved.China became the world’s largest oil importer in 2017 and top gas buyer the next year. The growing dependence on energy imports and the start of a trade dispute with the U.S. provoked President Xi in August 2018 to urge the country’s energy Goliaths to boost domestic output.During the price crash of 2016, PetroChina, the country’s biggest oil company, started shutting fields it described as having “no hope” of being profitable. Production plummeted then, from a peak of 4.3 million barrels a day in 2015, when it was the world’s fifth-biggest producer, to 3.8 million barrels in 2018, when it fell to No. 8.The cuts announced Wednesday are the first significant reductions by China’s state oil industry this year. They follow similar reductions made by global majors, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence, that include the following:Highlights of the first-quarter results of China’s three majors were:PetroChina and Sinopec reported net losses as global crude prices collapsed and refining margins crashed due to severe oversupply and plummeting demand during the coronavirus pandemic. Both companies also cited losses on the value of their inventories in storage.Cnooc’s revenue fell as a drop in realized oil prices overwhelmed a 9.5% increase in net production from the previous year.

They surged by more than a fifth of their value on Wednesday as Energy Information Administration data showed a surprise drop in American gasoline stockpiles and a jump in demand. In China, traffic is returning to the streets, supporting a boost in fuel consumption and refinery processing rates.U.S. output will fall by 2 million barrels a day in May compared with March and the price of crude has likely bottomed out, according to the head of trading house Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. Russia flagged that its production would drop by around a fifth and Norway also said it would curb output.Despite the supply cuts and indications of a tentative rebound in demand, there’s still a massive global glut of oil that will need to be cleared before there can be any meaningful recovery in prices. A fleet of supertankers carrying 43 million barrels of Saudi Arabian crude is bearing down on the U.S., which will add to the over-supply in the world’s largest economy.“Oil appears to have caught some tailwinds” with the EIA data less bearish than expected and gasoline demand recovering, said Vandana Hari, the founder of Vanda Insights in Singapore. “But it’s too early to call an inflection point.”WTI for June delivery rose 10% to $16.56 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 7:39 a.m. in London after jumping 22% on Wednesday. The discount for June futures relative to July was around $4 after blowing out to almost $8 Tuesday as major index funds ditched the front-month contract.Brent added 5.6% to $23.81 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange after climbing 10% in the previous session.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told the Interfax news agency that the nation’s oil companies will cut production by about 19% from February levels. Norway, western Europe’s biggest producer, said it would curb output by 250,000 barrels a day in June and 134,000 barrels in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, Nigeria will ship the smallest volume of its key Qua Iboe crude grade since 2016 in May and June.The EIA reported a smaller-than-expected 8.99 million-barrel increase in U.S. crude stockpiles and a 3.64 million-barrel build at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for futures. U.S. gasoline inventories fell by 3.67 million barrels, compared with expectations for a build of 2.49 million. Weekly gasoline supplied, an indicator of demand, rose by 549,000 barrels a day.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-extends-revival-signs-demand-222419452.html?.tsrc=rss

Stock turnover is down around 60% from a February peak, showing how quickly participation in the equity market has cratered.Some traders are switching to bonds and cash-like instruments instead, predicting stocks won’t really recover for at least another six months. The fading enthusiasm is in contrast with a surge of interest earlier this year, which pushed the sale of mutual funds to a record high.China’s economy may be showing signs of restarting, but it and its companies face a growing threat from slumping external demand. Cracks in the market are appearing, with traders unconvinced that stimulus measures will be enough to boost domestic growth.Yin Ming, vice president of Baptized Capital Co. in Shanghai, said he now has about 30% of his portfolio in cash, the highest level since mid-2015 after the stock market crash. His firm recently sold some stocks after prices hit their targets and he says there is no plan to add more in the near term.“A lot of listed companies’ earnings will be hurt this year considering the time and demand they lost due to the virus and production halts,” said Yin. “Many investors, including long-term funds, might choose to stay on the sidelines given the doubt on fundamentals.”Profits of Chinese industrial companies slumped the most on record in the first two months as the virus outbreak hurt business activities, the National Bureau of Statistics said last week. China International Capital Corp. said in a recent research note that the coronavirus outbreak could have a bigger impact on corporate earnings than the 2008 financial crisis.Repos and Convertible BondsWith demand for cash management rising, investors are turning to the repo market for what they see as better liquidity and positive returns. The volume of 1-day government bond repos traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange rose 20% from the end of February to the end of March.A cash financing facility that allows investors to lend money to borrowers with treasury as collateral, the government bond repo “is a very good tool for cash management, given its good liquidity and safe returns,” said Jiang Liangqing, a fund manager at Beijing-based Ruisen Capital Management, adding that he has been buying government bond repos traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange over recent weeks.Others are turning to the country’s convertible bond market as the stock market cools. The value traded in that market more than quadrupled in March, according to data from the China Securities Index Co., as investors sought opportunities to make quick profits in a looser regulatory environment.Convertible bonds offer equity-like returns with a more defensive tilt. As of April 1, a gauge tracking those assets showed a 4% advance since the stock market plunge of Feb. 3, outpacing the CSI 300 Index, which rose 1.6% Thursday.“This is no time for bottom-fishing in stocks,” said Winter Han, general manager at Beijing Yingchuang Century Investment Management Co. He has recently cut stock exposure while increasing cash holdings and also using index futures to build short positions.“For investors, the top priority right now is preserving the principal,” he said.(Updates with mutual fund sales in third paragraph, Thursday market performance)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-traders-cashing-love-risky-073358104.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-27	2020-03-27 02:21:29	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Even China’s Big Oil Is Cutting Back	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Under the watchful eye of Beijing’s energy hawks, China’s oil and gas majors have splurged for more than a decade, first on deals abroad and then drilling at home. Yet with crude prices at less than half where they were at the start of the year and demand battered by a coronavirus epidemic, they’re preparing to cut back.Cnooc Ltd. signaled Wednesday it might reduce its 2020 capital expenditure budget, which was set at as much as $13 billion, the highest since 2014. PetroChina Ltd., the country’s largest oil producer with a market value of $117 billion, suggested Thursday that it would do the same. Given the delicate politics involved, it’s a welcome hint of rational frugality.Energy security has always been a top concern for China’s leadership. Overseas deals peaked at $28 billion in 2012, the year Cnooc bid for Canada’s Nexen. Local production growth has been less exuberant, and China has been importing ever more. As trade tensions with Washington rose in 2018, President Xi Jinping urged the country’s state-owned titans to drill. That set off a frenzy from deepwater fields in the South China Sea to shale gas in Sichuan, where China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, has led. Performing national service is fine when oil is at $60 a barrel, even if the improvements are unimpressive compared to the capital spent. It’s a different matter when West Texas Intermediate is just coming off an 18-year low of less than $20. That’s a price at which no one can make money — not even Cnooc, with an all-in production cost of less than $30 per barrel of oil equivalent. Cnooc’s adventures in U.S. onshore and Canadian oil sands look terrible; its buccaneering domestic ventures are little better.Overseas, oil majors from Chevron Corp. to Saudi Aramco are cutting spending to preserve capital. Dividends are precarious. Logic dictates that China’s producers, even with healthier balance sheets, will follow the same pattern. The question is whether they can put financial logic ahead of political necessity. So far, the message is cautious: Cnooc executives pointed out that 2020 spending targets were drawn up when oil was at $65, so adjustments would be made. It gave no specifics. PetroChina, meanwhile, didn’t disclose precise targets for the year. That’s no accident, given a volatile market. After a string of personnel changes, there are new bosses across the industry. Political priorities haven’t been set in stone, given the delay in the annual National People’s Congress meeting. Still, the official message has been clear: Life is returning to normal after a devastating shutdown. Announcing a drastic spending cut, or anything that might hint at job losses or a weak economy, simply isn’t on the cards. PetroChina employed 476,000 at the end of 2018.That doesn’t mean that there won’t be mild cuts followed by steeper ones later in the year, a pattern seen before.How steep? Unlike during the last price crunch, in 2014 and 2015, the forward curve suggests prices will remain low, with little prospect for a quick solution to the Russia-Saudi spat that has worsened a global supply glut. Demand, meanwhile, is in the doldrums. China’s economy, and therefore its own appetite for oil and gas, is recovering only slowly, and the rest of the world is ailing as more lockdowns, factory closures and travel restrictions are imposed to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Analysts at UBS Group AG forecast Cnooc’s capex could come down 25% over the next two years, a cut that could be far deeper if oil averages closer to $30 this year. Overall, they project Chinese state-owned oil producers could cut spending by over a third, dragging production down 8% to 9%. Exploration budgets may be trimmed, though domestic production — where job preservation remains key — will mostly be spared. That leaves refining and other downstream activities, plus projects abroad, to bear the brunt. Low energy prices aren’t all bad for China, which imports more than 70% of the crude it consumes. Even liberalization of the domestic gas market becomes easier when prices are low enough for consumers to cope with change, Michal Meidan of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies points out. Cheaper oil could eventually stimulate demand. For now, a little less drilling all round. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

As the coronavirus from China spreads, oil prices keep falling, and the outbreak is certain to hurt the global economy.Saudi Arabia had already agreed to drop production to manage reduced demand and keep prices stable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut Russia was having none of it. Not only did it reject the production cuts but said it would pump more to make up for OPEC's reduced supply. Apparently heated words were exchanged by the Russian oil minister and the next in line to the Saudi throne, Mohammad bin Salman.Saudi Arabia then moved to start an all-out price war.Oil prices fell, and then Covid-19 hit the U.S. Major economic activity became restricted to slow its spread. And oil prices dropped even more, as the market fell.These energy stocks are all F-rated in my Portfolio Grader tool that I use to find Growth Investor plays. Avoid these seven companies like Covid-19. Energy Stocks to Sell: Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world's largest integrated oil companies. Usually that's a good thing, since in troubled times it can cut back on say, exploration and production, and continue to focus on downstream marketing and retail sales.But in a situation like this, there is no sector of the business that is doing well. And it's too big to cut back across the board in any meaningful way quickly enough. That's the trouble XOM stock is in now.It's exposed at every level and its global exposure makes it worse, not better. There is no place to turn.XOM stock is off 47% year-to-date. And crude and natural gas prices continue to plummet. The upside is, it has a sizable 8.3% dividend that's pretty safe. But there could be more than that in downside left. BP (BP)Source: TK Kurikawa / Shutterstock.com BP (NYSE:BP) is off 42% in the past month. Remember this is one of the oil giants and has a $90 billion market capitalization. This is not a small company where its stock price rises and falls like the sun.BP, like most of the other integrated oil majors, is in trouble because there's nowhere to turn in this kind of market. And now the global economy is looking shaky.And the fact is, if everyone is avoiding travel, shopping and public school, that directly and indirectly kills its business.Granted the stock is providing a 11.6% dividend now. But this is far too soon to jump in to get that. There's more downside left and that bottom hasn't been found yet. Meanwhile, other stocks have much better prospects due to revolutionary technology. ConocoPhillips (COP)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a major global exploration and production (E&P) company with other integrated operations. It has a good share of natural gas in its portfolio as well.But this is a very demand-based end of the business, and one of the most volatile. When energy prices were steady, it was ideal for COP since it could produce at a stable margin and create efficiencies to maximize those margins.Also, the U.S. economy was expanding, so it could sell into the market and deliver good numbers every quarter.Now, all that has changed. With decreasing demand, its access to and ability to supply energy products is not helping move the needle.The stock is off 56% in the past year, and 52% in the past month. The downside momentum is still very strong. Don't be tempted by its 6% dividend. Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is another global E&P player. It also has some midstream and downstream operations, but its business is pulling energy out of the ground.And that's not a great business right now. As a matter of fact, it's a terrible business right now.The stock is off 82% in the past year and 70% in the past month. And you can be sure, it won't be long until its massive 26.8% dividend gets cut. I'm all for bargain hunting if a company is actually a good buy, but don't bottom fish this thing right now; it's still a falling knife.Carl Icahn announced this week that he is looking to pick up a 10% share of the company here. That may sound encouraging, but unless you have a very long time frame and as much capital to be wrong as Icahn does, your best bet is to avoid this one for a while. PetroChina (PTR)Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com PetroChina (NYSE:PTR) is one of Asia's largest energy companies, but it hardly comes close to its global peers.It's one of two companies that supplies most of China with its energy needs and has created a fast-growing company that is building its global reputation by creating partnerships with larger majors.Yet while its long-term future is bright, given the support of the Chinese government, its short-term fate is a little less certain. First the U.S.-China trade war, and now Covid-19. That's a big one-two punch.The stock is off 50% in the past year and it has just announced that it's going to suspend shipments of liquified natural gas (LNG) imports for at least the next quarter. That was a deal it had with XOM and others. That's not a good sign of the demand in China. Devon Energy (DVN)Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is a decent-sized North American E&P company, with a $2.9 billion market cap.While most energy companies are struggling here, this is a good example of how the upstream sector is being impacted. It's usually the sector that's most leveraged to supply and demand issues with oil and natural gas production. (The select few energy stocks that make my Growth Investor list right now are midstream and downstream companies).DVN stock is off 67% in the past month and 74% in the past 12 months. This is a difficult trend and it's not a place where you should walk in thinking the worst is over.It's possible there may be an overreaction to the potential for a global recession, but it's not worth betting on right now.This is a risky sector that shouldn't be a risky investment, given all the oil and natural gas in the North American shale deposits where DVN works. Steer clear for now. Cimarex Energy (XEC)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Cimarex Energy (NYSE:XEC) is another E&P that's half the size (by market cap) of DVN. Yet its problems are just as big.XEC operates in the Southwest shale regions, including the big daddy of them all, the Permian Basin. But it doesn't matter how much oil and natural gas you can produce if there isn't a market that wants it.Shutting down wells or running them at half capacity is not what E&P companies want to do. But that is what has to be done. Some analysts are betting that this situation is overblown and are stepping in, but they're in the very small minority.The stock is off 62% in the past month and 78% in the past 12 months. This is another one to avoid in one of the hardest-hit sectors in the energy patch.The bottom line, though, is that energy companies are in a terrible position right now. Besides $30 per barrel oil, you have to consider that in the United States the stocks are basically not sold in 33 blue states; they're divesting due to environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investing philosophies.Instead, the companies I'm particularly keen on now are facilitating the spread of ultra-fast internet worldwide -- anywhere there's a cell tower. The 5G Buildout Is an Incredible Opportunity for Investors Right NowWithin two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. With 5G, we'll have cable modem speeds on any device; no need to plug in. That's a big deal for rural areas … the very same areas that are also key to President Donald Trump's reelection. So, by pushing 5G over the goal line, Trump will deliver a big win for his base -- and strike a blow against Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies.But, in the big picture, 5G is about much more than trade wars and faster downloads. Because 5G is 100 times faster than 4G, it'll allow your internet devices to work in real time. That advancement is a game changer for tech companies.With the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity with 5G stocks now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics … but they can't compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it's got ultra-fast 5G. That's how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I'm targeting is enjoying an influx of big money on Wall Street, and it has strong fundamentals, too -- making it an &quot;A&quot;-rated &quot;Strong Buy&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system.Click here to watch my new, free briefing on this extraordinary technology and the opportunity with 5G stocks.When you do, you'll see how to claim a free copy of my new stock report, The Netflix of 5G, which has full details on this company -- and what makes it such a great investment.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-03-12	2020-03-12 21:00:00	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Xi Ordered China’s Oil Industry to Drill, Then the Crash Came	(Bloomberg) -- Oil’s historic price crash is presenting an uncomfortable dilemma to China’s energy majors: follow market signals to cut drilling, or heed President Xi Jinping’s orders to boost output.While China’s main influence on global oil is as the world’s largest importer, it also produces 3.8 million barrels a day, more crude than all but two of OPEC’s individual members. The last time crude slumped this low, in 2016, China’s response was to cut spending at old and expensive fields, and output slumped.That may not be an option this time, after trade tensions with the U.S. prompted Xi in 2018 to order an increase in domestic exploration and production to safeguard the country’s energy security. The longer the price collapse lasts, the more the government’s push for energy sufficiency will be tested, with state-owned firms like PetroChina Co., Sinopec Corp. and Cnooc Ltd. caught in the middle.“The Chinese government still wants to produce more to enhance its self-sufficiency rate,” said Dennis Ip, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. “Lower oil prices are definitely going to hurt the cash flow for those Big Three oil majors. Whether they execute 100% of their capital plan this year, or try to defer, really depends on how long this lasts.”Crude prices have tumbled by nearly half since the beginning of the year as the coronavirus outbreak saps demand and Saudi Arabia and Russia unleash supply in what appears to be the start of a price war. U.S. drillers like Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Diamondback Energy Inc. have already announced plans to slash spending amid the rout.China’s drillers are particularly sensitive to lower prices, because its fields are older and require more work to sustain production, said Parul Chopra, vice president for upstream research at consultancy Rystad Energy AS. The price needed for new wells to break even in the country is about $41 a barrel, compared to $13 for Saudi Arabia and $11 for Iraq, he said. PetroChina, the country’s biggest oil company, described some of its fields as having “no hope” of being profitable during the 2016 price crash.China’s oil production plummeted during the last crash, from a peak of 4.3 million barrels a day in 2015, when it was the world’s fifth-biggest producer, to 3.8 million barrels in 2018, when it fell to No. 8.By then, the country had surpassed the U.S. to become the world’s biggest oil importer. With trade tensions boiling, Xi instructed state-owned energy firms to boost output. China National Petroleum Corp., the majority owner of listed PetroChina, said it would adopt “revolutionary measures” to ensure stable or increased production.The country’s three oil majors raised spending the following year by 18% and managed to reverse the decline in production. It came at a cost, though. PetroChina’s shares fell 20% even as the MSCI Asia Energy Index rose 6% and it was accused of putting national service above shareholders.China’s economic recovery from the coronavirus outbreak will add more incentive to keep drilling activity elevated, said Max Petrov, a principal analyst with energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie Ltd.“Beijing will want to keep energy flows and employment levels running high as economic activity returns to normality after the impact of Covid-19,” he said. “This suggests spending will remain high or accelerate during the second half of the year.”In the wake of this week’s price collapse, analysts have been busy marking down their forecasts for the listed units. While the big oil firms enjoy government favor -- and subsidies -- they’re not protected from market circumstances. PetroChina, for example, imports gas at a loss to facilitate China’s switch from coal to the cleaner burning fuel.Of the Big Three, Sinopec may be best placed to ride out the oil market’s meltdown, according to Citigroup, because of its huge refining operations, which benefit from cheaper crude. At the same time, the value of its oil inventory will have been crushed by the collapse, and that’ll weigh on profits.Cnooc, the biggest offshore explorer, is the only one of the three to announce spending plans this year, saying in January it would boost expenditure to the highest level since 2014. Daiwa’s Ip said all three companies are conducting internal analysis on spending levels following the recent price crash, and have yet to decide a course of action.Sinopec declined to comment on its spending plans. PetroChina and Cnooc didn’t respond to requests for comment.While the oil crash will hurt drillers’ profits, it offers another way for the country to boost energy security, said Tian Miao, an analyst at Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co. Plunging prices are creating an opportunity for China to import cheap crude to fill its strategic reserves, which it can tap if its supplies are ever threatened.“China’s commitment to boosting domestic oil and gas production will stay unchanged for the long term,” she said. “Domestic oil majors’ incentives for higher output and more capex will inevitably be reduced if oil prices remain weak for the rest of the year, but that can be offset by higher imports.”To contact the reporters on this story: Dan Murtaugh in Singapore at dmurtaugh@bloomberg.net;Jing Yang in Shanghai at jyang251@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Jason Rogers, Jasmine NgFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xi-ordered-china-oil-industry-210000409.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-20	2020-02-20 08:38:03	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	R.I.P. HNA, and the $143 Billion Empire You Built	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The house of HNA Group Co. may be no more, bringing an end to the dramatic rise and fall of one of the biggest buyers of global assets in recent years. It was about time.The Chinese government is planning to take over the airline-to-insurance-to-property conglomerate that splashed out over $40 billion in recent years to buy assets including stakes in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG and airplane lessor Avolon Holdings Ltd., Bloomberg News reported citing people familiar with the plans. A government seizure would mark the final step in an unwinding of the closely held and debt-encumbered behemoth that began more than two years ago.  In theory, Beijing was already running the show behind the scenes. In early 2018, as Anbang Insurance Group Co. (another binge-buyer that scooped up assets like New York’s Waldorf Astoria Hotel) was being taken over by the Chinese government, HNA was extended over $3 billion of credit lines by large state-owned lenders to keep going. Since then, on Beijing’s directive, it has sold off assets and attempted to retreat to its core airline-related business. Despite state support, HNA has still been late to make payments on bonds and unable to effectively run the sprawling businesses it bought.An official takeover would mean ownership changes at its foreign affiliates and subsidiaries. Would Ingram Micro Inc., the Irvine, California-based electronics distributor HNA bought in 2016, effectively become a Chinese state-owned enterprise? And if it did, would the company then have to go back to the Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S. for approval?Under its existing agreement with CFIUS, Ingram Micro is required to operate as a standalone company, and is subject to annual audits of its compliance with certain operating and security agreements, according to Moody’s Investors Service. The company’s board composition is governed by an agreement with CFIUS and the U.S. Defense Department. Another subsidiary, Swissport Group Sarl, a ground handler, serves over 300 airports and millions of metric tons of cargo through over 100 warehouses globally. HNA representatives comprise a majority of the board. If the government officially takes control of HNA, those relationships will get more complicated. Just this week, the U.S. State Department designated five Chinese state-owned media outlets as foreign missions, increasing their reporting requirements around property and personnel. Waltzing onto foreign boards or owning overseas real estate isn’t as easy for Chinese entities as it once was.It also makes sense that Beijing would act now, in the teeth of the coronavirus epidemic.There’s no doubt that with the outbreak all but halting the real economy, hard-up borrowers are coming to the fore. Analysts had long seen HNA’s indebtedness as a significant risk to the financial system. To fund the borrowing spree that fueled its risk, the company spun a complex web of debt between subsidiaries and affiliates, using its units as collateral at times to take on yet more debt.Now, Beijing is  opening the spigots and relaxing bad loan limits to encourage banks to lend more freely and keep the economy ticking over. In this emergency environment, the ongoing risk of a collapse in HNA’s enormous net debt pile — worth $69 billion at the end of June, bigger than the borrowings of PetroChina Co. or Walmart Inc. — isn’t helping. You’re less likely to extend credit to a struggling business if you think your existing loan book might turn bad.It’s never easy to undo the excess of an M&A binge, and HNA’s large and labyrinthine balance sheet has meant even its wave of selloffs has barely moved the needle. While total assets have fallen by about $46.53 billion, to $142.8 billion, since their peak at the end of 2017, net debt is actually marginally up, making it increasingly difficult for HNA to service its borrowings. Affiliates and subsidiaries like Ingram Micro and Swissport have already distanced themselves, placing clauses in debt agreements that protect their cash flows. Throughout HNA's history, operating income has only occasionally run ahead of interest payments.To the extent that management has been able to keep these plates spinning at all, it's likely to have depended heavily in recent months on the way that HNA's investments in logistics, air transport, catering and retail have given it a presence throughout the sinews of China's economy, and the world’s. The coronavirus represents a critical blow to that proposition. China's aviation market has shrunk from the world's third-biggest to 25th place because of the infection. Hotels and shopping malls are empty. Cash is barely flowing.Two years on, Beijing is still trying to shed the assets of Anbang, now renamed Dajia Insurance. Officially unwinding the House of HNA will prove a much hairier task. But China may have no other options left.To contact the authors of this story: Anjani Trivedi at atrivedi39@bloomberg.netDavid Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

2020-02-07	2020-02-07 16:33:10	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Expat Chinese Workers Scouring Foreign Pharmacies for Masks	(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.China’s state-controlled oil explorer PetroChina Co. has directed employees in 20 countries to buy face masks and send them home to help combat the lethal coronavirus.Employees from Rio to Houston to Lagos are rushing to pharmacies and home-improvement stores Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos. in search of masks. One employee was able to secure the last lot of masks at a Home Depot in Texas and shipped it back to China by express mail.It might sound strange that one of the world’s biggest oil companies would urge employees to get involved in the effort, rather than assigning the task to its purchasing department. But the request came as no surprise to Chinese nationals. PetroChina’s status as a government-owned entity means all workers are employees of the state and, as such, are expected to play an active role in the process, one person said.The goal is to get 2 million masks shipped back to headquarters. the person said. Petrochina didn’t immediately return email seeking comment.PetroChina, the oil titan with a market value larger than western majors like BP Plc and ConocoPhillips, is just one of many corporations with foreign operations that the Chinese government has deployed to gather medical supplies and send them home.CounterfeitersThe brisk demand for masks is spurring counterfeiters to flood the market with bogus respiratory devices, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. A single N95 mask -- the grade commonly employed by hospital workers and civilians -- usually must be replaced every eight hours, the CDC said.Home Depot has experienced a nationwide increase in demand for masks, including some stores selling out, spokeswoman Sara Gorman said. To avoid a run on the products through bulk purchases, the retail giant has limited the number of masks that each customer can buy to 10, she said.Several Home Depots in the Houston area reported running out of masks by noon every day.Meanwhile, alcohol and ethanol makers including Tsingtao Brewery Co. are shifting to produce disinfectant to help ease a shortage in medical grade alcohol, with an industry association urging others to follow suit.Rising TollMore than 31,000 people have been infected with coronavirus in China as of Thursday, and more than 600 have died. The run on face masks and medical supplies has stretched beyond China’s borders.From airlines that have halted travel to China to Saudi Arabia blocking expatriates that travel to the country from returning home, the growing health crisis has pushed governments and businesses around the world to adopt unprecedented measures to stem the spread of the virus. Nowhere is the problem more acute than in China, with Hubei province still in lockdown as deaths continue to rise.PetroChina sent instructions in the form of a memo to offices globally, including Tokyo, Houston and Singapore, according to a copy of the memo seen by Bloomberg News. Chinese steel companies also have been buying masks and other gear abroad, including from Japan, Germany and Italy, according to the nation’s iron and steel association.(Adds detail on mask procurement beginning in second paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Jinshan Hong, Krystal Chia, Tian Ying, Alfred Cang, Jackie Davalos, Matt Townsend and Niu Shuping.To contact the reporters on this story: Lucia Kassai in Houston at lkassai@bloomberg.net;Stephen Stapczynski in Singapore at sstapczynsk1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, ;David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Joe Carroll, Mike JeffersFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ex-pat-chinese-workers-scouring-163310569.html?.tsrc=rss

The biggest suppliers of LNG to CNOOC include Anglo-Dutch energy company Royal Dutch Shell, France's Total, Australia's Woodside Petroleum and Qatargas, industry sources said.

2020-02-06	2020-02-06 09:01:29	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Commodity Chaos Deepens as China LNG Buyer Invokes Force Majeure	(Bloomberg) -- The turmoil engulfing global commodity markets deepened as China’s biggest buyer of liquefied natural gas told suppliers it won’t honor some contracts because of the coronavirus.In a dramatic and rare step, China National Offshore Oil Corp. declared what’s known as force majeure, meaning it won’t take delivery of some LNG cargoes, because the virus is constraining its ability to import the fuel. It’s among the first known cases of the legal clause being invoked in commodity contracts as a result of the epidemic.While global markets bounce back from initial fears over the impact of the virus, CNOOC’s move shows the fallout is only deepening in the world of raw materials, which is dominated by China’s enormous appetite. Beijing’s efforts to contain the disease by shutting down swathes of the country and restricting travel are disrupting supply chains and hammering demand in the world’s biggest consumer.The impact is reverberating around the world. Copper buyers are requesting Chilean miners postpone shipments because of port shutdowns while China’s biggest oil refiner, Sinopec Group, is likely to ask Saudi Arabia to reduce supplies of crude oil next month. Soybeans from Brazil and the U.S. are being held up on arrival in eastern China and Indonesian palm oil shipments are also being delayed.For LNG, CNOOC’s force majeure hurts a market already buffeted by rising U.S. supplies and weak demand after a mild winter in Europe and Asia. Even before Chinese buyers walked away from supply contracts, spot prices have fallen to a record low, crippling the profitability of energy giants like Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp.CNOOC sent the force majeure notice to suppliers including Shell and Total SA, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Shell declined to comment while Total’s press office didn’t respond to a request for comment. The French company’s chief executive said he hadn’t received the force majeure notice.China said last week that it would offer support to companies seeking to declare force majeure on international contracts. The clause allows a company to opt out of obligations without legal recourse because of reasons beyond its control.CNOOC isn’t the only Chinese LNG buyer affected. The country’s largest oil and gas firm, PetroChina Co., was forced to delay discharge timings for multiple cargoes because it can’t get enough workers to its Rudong, Dalian and Caofeidian LNG terminals to run them at full capacity. The company hasn’t invoked force majeure because of the delays.&#92;--With assistance from James Thornhill, Feifei Shen, Javier Blas, Serene Cheong, Alfred Cang and Dan Murtaugh.To contact the reporter on this story: Stephen Stapczynski in Singapore at sstapczynsk1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Alexander KwiatkowskiFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-gas-buyer-cnooc-declares-064044988.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-02-04	2020-02-04 02:59:38	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Virus Jolts China Economy, Forcing Rethink on Almost Everything	(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.China is preparing steps to adjust to a slower rate of economic growth as the coronavirus outbreak shows few signs of abating.Officials are evaluating whether to soften the economic-growth target for 2020, while state-owned liquefied natural gas importers are considering declaring themselves unable to fulfill some obligations on cargo deliveries -- known as force majeure -- according to people familiar with the matter. And authorities in Beijing are hoping the U.S. will agree to some flexibility on pledges in their phase-one trade deal, people close to the situation said.Two-thirds of the Chinese economy will remain closed this week as several provinces took the extraordinary step of extending the Lunar New Year holiday to help curb the spread of the disease that’s claimed 425 lives, with 20,438 confirmed cases, mostly in Hubei.Below is a wrap of the considerations:Potential GDP ReductionThe annual growth target is typically unveiled in March at the country’s legislative session after being endorsed by top leaders at the yearly closed-door Central Economic Work Conference in December. Economists had expected China would aim for output growth of “around 6%” this year after seeking a range of 6% to 6.5% in 2019. Bloomberg Economics reckons growth could dip to 4.5% in the current quarter.Officials are also considering further measures to shore up the economy, including selling more special government bonds, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the private talks. They also could increase the planned cap on the ratio of the budget deficit to gross domestic product, they said.This year’s legislative gathering, which is scheduled to begin March 5, could be delayed as the epidemic disrupts work across the country.China’s State Council Information Office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Any changes to the growth target would have to be approved by top leaders of the Communist Party.Party MeetingChinese President Xi Jinping called on all officials to quickly work together to contain the virus at a rare meeting of top leaders, saying the outcome would directly impact social stability in the country.The effort to contain the virus directly affects people’s health, China’s economic and social stability, and the country’s process of opening up, he told a meeting of the Communist Party’s powerful Politburo Standing Committee on Monday. Leaders also urged officials “to achieve the targets of economic and social development this year” and “promote stable consumer spending.”It was the second meeting of China’s senior-most leaders to handle the crisis in recent days, a rare occurrence over the past few decades.LNG DeliberationsOil consumption in China, the world’s the top crude importer and second-biggest LNG buyer, is already estimated to have dropped by 20%, which is expected to cause fuel makers to cut back production and seek to delay some oil shipments. A decline in gas demand is similarly forcing buyers to consider postponing deliveries to cope with high inventories.LNG importers including China National Offshore Oil Corp. are still assessing the impact on consumption and haven’t decided yet whether to make the declarations, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information isn’t public. Firms declare force majeure when they’re unable to meet contractual obligations for reason beyond their control.CNOOC and PetroChina Co. have begun drafting the necessary documents to issue the declarations, in case they decide to move ahead, said the people. Sinopec Corp. is also considering force majeure.PetroChina and Sinopec declined to comment. Nobody answered multiple calls to CNOOC.U.S. TradeThe U.S. and China on Jan. 15 sealed the first phase of a trade agreement that’s supposed to take effect in mid-February. It has a clause that states the nations will consult “in the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event” delays either from complying with the accord. It’s unclear whether China has formally requested such a consultation yet, but the people familiar with the matter said the plan is to ask for it at some point.A spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Washington hadn’t received any request from China to discuss changes in Beijing’s purchase commitments. The Chinese Commerce Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.In the first year of the deal, China committed to buy an extra $76.7 billion of American goods beyond what it did in 2017, and an additional $123.3 billion in the second year. Purchases of agricultural products are particularly important for the livelihoods of American farmers who’ve been hurt in an escalating tariff war with China over the past two years and are a key base of support for President Donald Trump.Read the latest on impact of the coronavirus from Bloomberg EconomicsEven before the outbreak, China’s economy was already slowing amid weak domestic demand, a crackdown on debt and the trade war with the Trump administration. GDP expanded 6.1% last year, the least in almost three decades, and just within the range targeted by President Xi Jinping’s administration.In a containment scenario -- with a severe but short-lived impact -- the virus could take China’s first-quarter gross domestic product growth down to 4.5% year on year, according to Bloomberg Economics. That’s a drop from 6% in the final period of 2019 and the lowest since quarterly data that begins in 1992.Most of China’s provinces said before the virus became widespread they’re expecting slower economic growth in 2020, with at least 22 out of 31 major cities, provinces and autonomous regions cutting their targets as of Jan. 21, according to their work reports which lay out plans for this year.China’s central bank took its first concrete steps to cushion the economy and plunging markets from the blow of the virus, providing short-term funding to banks and cutting the interest rate it charges for the money.The People’s Bank of China added a net 150 billion yuan ($21.4 billion) of funds on Monday using 7-day and 14-day reverse repurchase agreements. The rate for both was cut by 10 basis points, driving down the cost of the money to “ensure ample liquidity during the special period of virus control,” it said in a statement. PBOC adviser Ma Jun indicated he expects further rate cuts later in the month.The cash injection was part of a raft of supportive measures announced over the weekend to soften a market sell-off and help firms affected by the disease outbreak and extended holiday.(Updates number of cases in third paragraph, party meeting from eighth.)&#92;--With assistance from Stephen Stapczynski, Alfred Cang, Niu Shuping, Steven Yang, Jenny Leonard and Shawn Donnan.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Steven Yang in Beijing at kyang74@bloomberg.net;Zheng Li in Shanghai at zli698@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: John Liu at jliu42@bloomberg.net, ;Brendan Murray at brmurray@bloomberg.net, Malcolm ScottFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-considers-lowering-2020-growth-112921218.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-02-03	2020-02-03 07:39:22	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Commodities Hammered in China by Virus-Driven Demand Fears	(Bloomberg) -- Chinese commodity prices collapsed on the first day of trading after the Lunar New Year break as investors returned to markets gripped by fear over the impact the coronavirus will have on demand in the world’s biggest consumer of raw materials.The country’s three major commodity exchanges were hit by a fevered bout of selling as they reopened with Chinese traders getting their first opportunity to catch up with losses inflicted on overseas markets while they had been on holiday.Metals, energy and agriculture futures were all hammered, with iron ore, crude, copper and palm oil contracts all sinking by their daily allowable limit within seconds of markets opening. Shares in commodity also producers tumbled as stock markets resumed trading.Investors have deserted raw materials around the world from copper in London to palm oil in Kuala Lumpur over fears about the economic fallout from the virus. More than a dozen Chinese provinces have announced an extension of the new year holiday by more than a week in a bid to halt the spread of the virus that has killed hundreds of people and sickened thousands.“Investors are fleeing from commodities and seeking risk-aversion assets,” said Chen Tong, an analyst with Tianjin-based First Futures. “Everything from consumption to logistics has stagnated with 30 Chinese provinces and regions announcing the highest level of public health emergency and so the market is basically bearish across the board.”By the 3 p.m. close of trading, iron ore was 6.6% lower at 606.50 yuan a ton, the weakest since November. Steel reinforcement bar closed down 7.6% after opening at its downside limit. Domestic oil futures saw the biggest decline since their debut in March 2018 while copper dropped 6.2% and palm oil by 6.9%. Markets won’t reopen until Tuesday morning after China canceled overnight trading.The sell-off on commodities exchanges was repeated across China’s financial markets, with stocks plummeting by the most since an equity bubble burst in 2015. Bond yields dropped the most since 2014 and the onshore yuan weakened below the key 7-per-dollar level.The mainland-traded shares of Chinese companies that mine, refine and smelt the nation’s raw materials weren’t spared the rout. Jiangxi Copper Co., the biggest copper smelter, tumbled by its daily limit of 10% in Shanghai, while Baoshan Iron & Steel tumbled 9.9%. PetroChina Co., its biggest energy company, lost 9%.Authorities have pledged to provide abundant liquidity and urged investors to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus objectively. The central bank on Monday reduced rates as it injected cash into the financial system.Investors are nonetheless spooked about the impact of the virus on growth as swathes of the country are locked down. Bloomberg Economics estimated growth could slump to 4.5%, the lowest in quarterly data going back to 1992.For raw materials, regions accounting for about 90% of copper smelting, 60% of steel production, 65% of oil refining and 40% of coal output have told firms to delay restarting operations until at least Feb. 10.Fears over the effect that’s going to have on demand and supply balances had hammered global prices while Chinese markets were shut. Brent crude tumbled about 6% and Singapore’s iron ore contract lost almost 11% during the new year holiday, while copper on the London Metal Exchange capped its worst month since 2015. Malaysian palm oil last week fell the most since 2008.Traders are looking for any signs of how the virus will impact demand and the flow of commodities in to and out of the country. Chinese oil demand has already dropped by about three million barrels a day, or 20% of total consumption, as the coronavirus squeezes the economy, according to people with inside knowledge of the country’s energy industry.The drop is probably the largest demand shock the oil market has suffered since the global financial crisis of 2008 to 2009, and the most sudden since the Sept. 11 attacks. China is the world’s largest oil importer, so any change in consumption has an outsize impact on the global energy market.China is also the biggest producer of refined copper and steel, and imports two-thirds of the world’s seaborne iron ore. Its share of global base metals demand exceeded 50% in the first 10 months of last year, from less than 20% during the SARS crisis, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.While Chinese metals markets tanked on Monday, some contracts on the London Metal Exchange rebounded, with copper rising for the first time in 14 days.And losses weren’t universal across China’s commodity markets. Bullion on the Shanghai Gold Exchange advanced 2.5%, while thermal coal escaped the massive sell-off as traders weighed extended mine shutdowns due to the virus outbreak.&#92;--With assistance from Krystal Chia, Winnie Zhu and Andrew Janes.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Sarah Chen in Beijing at schen514@bloomberg.net;Alfred Cang in Singapore at acang@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Will Kennedy at wkennedy3@bloomberg.net, Anna Kitanaka, Alexander KwiatkowskiFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commodity-prices-collapse-china-demand-010846588.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-17	2020-01-17 06:17:33	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	China Energy Leaders Set for Shake-Up Amid Sector Revamp	(Bloomberg) -- Top executives at China’s leading energy companies are set for a power shake-up as the nation takes steps to reorganize and revamp its leadership and energy infrastructure.The executive changes at the state-owned giants come as the sector is under pressure to increase competition and boost domestic output in the face of growing dependence on energy imports. The government this week opened its upstream sector to foreign drillers and last month rolled out plans to spin off the nation’s pipelines into a new firm to allow more companies access to energy infrastructure.Dai Houliang, chairman of refining giant Sinopec Group, is set to be named the new chairman and party secretary of the country’s biggest oil firm, China National Petroleum Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. Wang Yilin, the current CNPC chairman, is set to step down and retire, they added.The top job in Sinopec Group, formally known as China Petrochemical Corp., will be taken by Zhang Yuzhuo, former chairman of coal colossus China Shenhua Energy Co., said the people who asked not to be identified as the information is private.Li Fanrong, deputy director of China’s National Energy Administration and former CEO of CNOOC Ltd., will be named as general manager of CNPC, said the people. Zhang Wei, current general manager at CNPC, will be appointed chairman of the newly-established national oil and gas pipeline company.The decision by China’s central government is set to be announced as early as this week. Nobody responded to emails or calls sent to CNPC and Sinopec’s press offices.State Grid Corp., China’s largest operator of electric networks, also named a new top executive, putting Mao Weiming in place as chairman and party chief.‘Major Change’CNPC is the nation’s largest driller and natural gas importer, and is the parent of PetroChina Co., while Sinopec Group is the world’s largest oil refiner by capacity and parent of China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. The appointment of the new CNPC executives will be especially positive for PetroChina, according to analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. including Neil Beveridge in a note to clients. Dai could help shape up the company’s struggling refining and petrochemical division, while Li’s stint at Cnooc proved him “one of the highest caliber CEOs within China’s oil and gas industry over the past decade.”“We view his appointment as a strong sign that significant reform could take place within the PetroChina which is undergoing major change with pipeline reform,” Beveridge said.Even as PetroChina and Sinopec have raised spending to boost output -- heeding calls from President Xi Jinping to bolster the nation’s energy security -- the country has become more dependent on foreign supplies.China’s dependence on overseas oil has grown from less than 50% in 2005 to nearly 75% by the end of last year as more than two decades of super-charged growth have made it the world’s biggest importer. China also became the world’s biggest natural gas importer in 2018, overtaking Japan after a government push for cleaner energy caused demand to surge.(Updates with analyst comments in 8th, 9th paragraphs.)&#92;--With assistance from Dan Murtaugh.To contact the reporter on this story: Alfred Cang in Singapore at acang@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Serene Cheong at scheong20@bloomberg.net, Dan MurtaughFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-energy-leaders-set-shake-061733119.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-12	2020-01-12 23:00:17	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	China Opens Up to Oil Majors at the Wrong Time	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Broad new horizons in key markets are opening for the world’s energy companies. Don’t expect to see a land rush any time soon. China will allow all large domestic and foreign companies to apply for oil and gas exploration licenses that were previously only open to state-owned enterprises, the country’s resources ministry said at a briefing Thursday. In India, regulators will also let private and international companies bid for a group of coal blocks it’s putting up for auction starting this month, the country’s coal and mines minister Pralhad Joshi said this week, chipping away at a near-monopoly enjoyed by state-controlled Coal India Ltd.A decade or so ago, such announcements might have caused international energy companies to salivate with excitement. All the fear back then was that state-owned giants like Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and Petroleos de Venezuela SA controlled all the viable assets to fuel a coming era of ever-increasing fossil fuel demand, leaving listed businesses running out of reserves. How things have changed.For one thing, it’s national governments rather than independent companies that are now worried about supply shortages. China’s domestic oil production has fallen about 10% since peaking five years ago. India’s coal output is still edging up, but not fast enough to meet demand: Net imports have accounted for about a quarter of consumption in recent years, up from 10% a decade ago.Meanwhile, energy companies are awash with supply. The revolution in fracking means that America’s shale patch would count as one of the world’s top three oil producers if considered on its own. It briefly overtook Saudi Arabia for the number two spot behind Russia after an attack on the Gulf country’s oil facilities in September.Conventional oil and gas discoveries are booming, too, hitting a four-year high of 12.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent last year, according to consultancy Rystad Energy AS. Storied oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp., Total SA, BP Plc and Eni SpA chalked up some of the year’s best discoveries. On the demand side, consumption of petroleum may peak as soon as a decade from now, well within the lifetime of most conventional oilfields.As a result, the interests of fossil fuel producers and the energy-hungry governments seeking to attract them are fundamentally opposed. Beijing and New Delhi ultimately want to boost domestic output at all costs, and hope that foreign businesses can sprinkle some innovative magic that local giants can’t muster. International oil companies, on the other hand, are ruing a decade when they chased barrels to the exclusion of all else. They’re now much more focused on developing only the most profitable fields, wherever they’re to be found.It’s probably unfair to characterize the state-owned Chinese and Indian companies as lazy behemoths, too. PetroChina Co.’s capital spending is bigger than that of Exxon Mobil and BP put together, and about half the wells it drills each year are in the Changqing field, where most new development is in difficult formations similar to those in the U.S. shale patch. Coal India, likewise, is hampered by the fact that most of the country’s coal is high in ash and low in energy, and dependent on a creaky rail network to make it to power stations.The problem, instead, is that the remorseless facts of poor geology make it nearly impossible to develop domestic reserves profitably, especially when government targets are driving state-owned companies to increase output with little regard for cost.Take the Qingcheng field, a corner of the Changqing deposit that counts as PetroChina’s largest single shale find. Even after recent efforts to drive down costs, the internal rate of return for Qingcheng wells is now only 8% to 9%, Cathy Chan, an analyst at CCB International Holdings Ltd., wrote in an October note.It’s fanciful to think this would tempt foreign investors. Such returns barely cover PetroChina’s own cost of capital. In Texas’s Permian basin, comparably low returns were last seen in early 2016, when the local fracking industry was on the brink of collapse. IRRs of 20% to 40% are typical for unconventional petroleum in the U.S. Given the substantial political risks that come from operating in China these days, it’s very hard to see the attraction here for international energy businesses.The best path to energy security for China and India is to encourage their own renewable energy and electrified transport industries — an approach that will improve the health of their populations, reduce climate risks, and leave them far less dependent on imported fuels. That’s a much better idea than wasting money trying to get blood from a stone, or hoping that clever foreigners will be able to find hidden deposits where local talent has failed.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-12-23	2019-12-23 16:54:13	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	3 Dividend Stocks to Buy for China Bulls Heading into 2020	Progress on the U.S.-China trade war has boosted Chinese stocks. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has broken out to a new all-time high, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has returned to mid-2018 levels and the iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI) has rallied nicely from August lows. All three are looking like great stocks to buy.For some investors, however, there's a catch: Few Chinese stocks pay a dividend. Income investors looking for stocks to invest in can get exposure to the region through a stock like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). But, for those businesses -- as with many American companies -- China drives only a small portion of revenue and profits.Nonetheless, income investors looking for dividend stocks to buy to capitalize on the Chinese market do have some options. Unsurprisingly, these names do have risk. Yet, they have real rewards, too -- both in terms of dividends and the possibility of further appreciation if renewed optimism toward China persists.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top-Tier Dividend Stocks for 2020 So, let's take a look at a few Chinese stocks to possibly get your hands on. 3 Dividend Stocks to Buy: Las Vegas Sands (LVS)Source: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.com Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) offers potentially the best combination of income and exposure to the Chinese economy. LVS hiked its dividend around 2.6% in 2020 in its third-quarter report, and now yields nearly 4.5% at the current price. That increase was the company's eighth-consecutive annual raise.However, despite its U.S. domicile, Sands's results rely almost solely on Chinese demand at this point. Through the first nine months of 2019, nearly 60% of Adjusted Property EBITDA came from the company's operations in the Chinese enclave of Macau. Nearly another 35% comes from the Marina Bay Sands property in Singapore -- which too attracts Chinese gamblers.As noted before, there are risks. Sands' concession in Macau expires in 2022, and must be renewed. However, the odds of Sands failing to secure an extension are &quot;remote,&quot; as credit analyst Fitch put it earlier this year. Also, the thawing of the trade war is a big positive on this front; there was the chance that LVS chairman Sheldon Adelson, a prominent supporter of President Donald Trump, could get his company drawn into the proverbial crossfire.But, as Fitch noted, it's also possible that authorities could raise the tax rate or require other adjustments. Any &quot;hard landing&quot; in China could send profits tumbling. And, the dividend payout ratio is nearing 100% -- meaning hikes going forward likely will be minimal.Still, there's a nice bull case here. Income investors should check out Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) as well, which raised its dividend 33% this year and yields 2.9%. PetroChina (PTR)Source: Gil C / Shutterstock.com PetroChina (NYSE:PTR) seems like the forgotten Chinese giant. It has the second-highest market capitalization among U.S.-listed companies based in China, behind only Alibaba. Yet, it receives a fraction of the coverage of other Chinese names.Additionally, there's an attractive combination of exposure to Chinese growth and dividend income. PTR shares are cheap, at barely 13x forward earnings, but -- like LVS -- there are risks.Unlike most U.S. companies, PTR's dividend is inconsistent in terms of its size and is only paid semi-annually. The yield based on 2019 distributions is over 4% and nearing 5%, but that may not be the case in 2020 -- particularly with earnings declining of late. PetroChina needs oil prices to hold up, as well.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd Income investors looking for consistency might look instead to names like BP (NYSE:BP) or Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), the latter of which clearly has seen some support thanks to its dividend. Those looking to add growth or potential upside, however, might considering swapping out those established names for the higher-upside PTR. China Mobile (CHL)Source: testing / Shutterstock.com Shares of China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) already have bounced nearly 10% since hitting an 11-year low this month. They may rally further this week thanks to the so-called &quot;Barron's bounce&quot;. That publication called out CHL stock as a cheap, yet dominant play this weekend -- and made a strong case in the process.After all, as Barron's pointed out, China Mobile has 10 times the customers of Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) or AT&T (NYSE:T). And, like those U.S. giants, it has a 5G catalyst on the way. Yet, by any measure, it trades at a substantial discount to its American counterparts.With a 4.5%-plus dividend yield, there's a nice income case here as well. And, if CHL stock does rise too sharply this week, investors can also look at smaller rival China Telecom (NYSE:CHA).Obviously, both Chinese telecommunications companies need their domestic economy to cooperate. But, if it does, the gains in both stocks in recent sessions could be the prelude to substantial upside in 2020.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

This follows a move by China National Offshore Oil Corp., the largest buyer, to swap multiple December and January cargoes for later supply to help manage brimming inventories.Chinese companies stocked up on LNG for the heating season, but warmer temperatures have curbed demand at the same time supply is ramping up at new projects. Prices in North Asia are more than 40% lower than they were a year ago, and none of China’s major buyers are currently seeking prompt deliveries for the winter, according to traders surveyed by Bloomberg.PetroChina offered the February cargo at a 8.594% slope to Brent oil, beating out three other firms. Pakistan, which doesn’t always award its tenders, will notify PetroChina of its decision by Dec. 30.This is at least the second time PetroChina has offered the cheapest price in a Pakistan tender. The company, which has traditionally been a buyer but has trading ambitions, was the lowest bidder on a Nov. 30 delivery cargo, which Pakistan ultimately chose not to purchase.To contact the reporter on this story: Stephen Stapczynski in Singapore at sstapczynsk1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Jasmine Ng, Aaron ClarkFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-china-buyer-offering-lng-210001596.html?.tsrc=rss

The U.S. and China have agreed to roll back tariffs on each other’s goods in phases as they work toward a deal, giving some relief to the outlook for oil demand. Yet American crude inventories jumped last week, and delegates from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies say the group’s biggest producers aren’t pushing for further intervention to clear up a global excess.“The U.S.-China trade talks are heading in the right direction” but “there are still several obstacles that will need to be overcome,” said Stephen Brennock, an analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd. in London. “The road to a final resolution will be bumpy. The upside for the risk-asset complex is limited and the current momentum is built on wobbly foundations.”Oil has fallen about 15% since hitting this year’s peak in April as the trade spat saps crude consumption and global supplies expand. OPEC and its partners will probably keep output steady when they meet next month as markets are on track to rebalance, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Trafigura Group Ltd.WTI for December delivery declined $1.02 to $56.13 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 9:10 a.m. local time.

2019-11-08	2019-11-08 06:48:00	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	China’s Rudong LNG Shows Signs of Life After Outage Cut Imports	(Bloomberg) -- PetroChina Co.’s Rudong terminal received its first cargo of liquefied natural gas in more than a month this week after its shut-down helped break the country’s 30-month streak of rising imports.A tanker, Gaslog Singapore, docked at the terminal in Jiangsu province Wednesday and departed the following day with a lower draft, ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show, indicating it discharged LNG. It was the first ship to visit the port since late September, when a pipeline was damaged during a storm.The loss of the terminal, which is among China’s biggest, contributed to total gas imports dropping to 6.52 million tons in October, the first year-on-year decline since March 2017. Inbound shipments, including LNG and piped gas, were down 780,000 tons from October 2018, according to customs data released Friday. That difference may be mostly attributed to Rudong, which took in about 727,000 tons of LNG last October, compared with nothing last month, according to ship-tracking data.The outage is also adding to a general import slowdown by China as a trade war with the U.S. takes its toll on industrial activity. Through the end of October, gas imports are up about 7.9% this year, compared with a 33% jump over the same period a year ago.Already Slowing“China’s gas imports growth has been already slowing down since summer,” said Maggie Kuang, an analyst with BloombergNEF. “The outage at Rudong has just made the slow-down even more noticeable.”It’s unclear how quickly the Rudong terminal will ramp up to full capacity. Repair works are still being completed to allow for pipeline shipments to customers later this month, according to a trader with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. PetroChina didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.China’s winter demand season officially begins Nov. 15, when Beijing turns on central heating system. That should drive up gas consumption and make room for more imports. “Gas demand in China is set to increase,” Kuang said.Milder weather during winter could limit that seasonal demand. There is a “very low chance” of colder-than-normal temperatures in China this winter, the nation’s meteorological administration said on its website Thursday.To contact the reporters on this story: Stephen Stapczynski in Singapore at sstapczynsk1@bloomberg.net;Dan Murtaugh in Singapore at dmurtaugh@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Jasmine NgFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-rudong-lng-shows-signs-064800726.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-11-08	2019-11-08 06:18:21	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	This Trade Rally Is One Tweet Away From a Crash	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Everything is awesome in financial markets. The sense that a trade deal may finally be on the cards sent stocks and crude soaring in the U.S. Thursday, while flight-to-safety trades such as bonds and gold slumped. Both sides seem to be moving toward a phase one agreement that would involve jointly reducing tariffs in return for vaguer concessions on the underlying issues.“If there’s a phase one trade deal, there are going to be tariff agreements and concessions,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg.“If China, U.S. reach a phase-one deal, both sides should roll back existing additional tariffs,” China’s Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said earlier.There’s a laconic warning buried inside both of those statements: “If.”It’s certainly possible that President Donald Trump is tiring of the trade war and as desperate to get an agreement on the table as Beijing seems to think. But the current febrile atmosphere appears to have left the fundamentals of this dispute behind. A single tweet from @realdonaldtrump could be enough to puncture the party mood.Consider some of the things you might expect to be seeing if a significant agreement was really in the works. China is well aware of the importance of the bilateral trade deficit in Washington, and one of the most promising areas for any agreement is to sharply increase imports of American agricultural and mineral products.Yet China's biggest oil producer, state-owned PetroChina Co., is behaving as if the opposite plan is underway. In results last week, the company reported its trailing 12-month capital spending rose to the highest level since 2014, thanks to a government push to lessen China’s dependence on imported fuel.PetroChina’s returns on invested capital are already the worst of the oil majors, and pressure to extract more oil and gas from China’s unpromising geology will make that situation worse. A country that was serious about balancing out the trade relationship with the U.S. and making the most productive use of state companies’ cash would be looking for ways to tap America’s energy boom instead.It’s a similar case with agriculture. China could increase its imports of poultry, beef, pork and other products by as much as $53 billion just by removing current constraints on trade, according to a study last year by Minghao Li, Wendong Zhang and Dermot Hayes of Iowa State University.If anything, that’s probably low-balling it: You could add $10 billion to the total just by taking soybean imports back to where they were before the current round of trade tensions cut that trade close to zero. One only needs to look at China’s trade data released Friday to see that the opposite is happening. The surplus with the U.S. may be narrowing, but on a global, trailing 12-month basis it was the widest it’s been since May 2017. Part of that is simply the weakness of domestic demand. But hosting jazzy import conferences won’t change the fact that President Xi Jinping’s praise of zili gengsheng, or self-reliance, is just as pointed a retreat from trade as Trump’s “Make America Great Again” mantra.All this comes before even touching on issues around intellectual property, technology transfer and state involvement in the economy, which were ostensibly the reasons for this trade war in the first place. China continues to make quiet progress on the first front as if the trade war wasn’t happening; and formal technology transfer is shrinking, too, although stories of outright industrial espionage abound. On the third point, the Chinese state is, if anything, becoming an even more dominant economic actor than it was hitherto.What about this backdrop makes a deal seem so imminent? Beijing appears unlikely to make the sorts of concessions on the main issues under contention that would allow Trump to present an agreement as a personal victory. Trump, for his part, is presiding over a stock market that — thanks in part to all the optimism about a trade deal — hits fresh records every day, giving him no incentive to sign on to a deal that looks like a climb-down.Right now, markets are behaving as if the whole structure of trade impediments built up over the past two years could start getting dismantled within weeks. It’s quite as likely that, in the white heat of a breakdown, the levies suspended last month are reinstated, only to be followed by the final round still due to kick in Dec. 15. Should that come about, the current exuberance could turn into a hangover awfully quick.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-09-04	2019-09-04 07:40:50	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	CLSA, BOCI Among Banks Chosen for China National Pipeline Giant	(Bloomberg) -- China has chosen at least three banks to work on the formation of the planned national oil and gas pipeline company, according to people with knowledge of the matter.BOC International Holdings Ltd., China International Capital Corp. and CLSA Ltd. have been picked as the advisers, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Their tasks include extracting pipeline assets from the parent companies of the state’s three listed oil and gas firms -- PetroChina Co., China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, and Cnooc Ltd. -- and setting up a new entity to hold the assets, the people said.The national pipeline company would be provisionally named China Pipelines Corp., people familiar with the matter have said. Under the plan, state-controlled and private funds will inject capital sufficient to lower the combined stake held by the three oil majors to about 50%. The company may then file for an initial public offering, while details of the share sale could still change, the people said at that time.China’s State-owned Assets Supervision & Administration Commission is expected to be the biggest shareholder in the new company, while the three oil giants will also have stakes, one of the people said.The creation of the company is part of President Xi Jinping’s drive to streamline industrial capacity, especially among state-owned enterprises. The country has been considering centralizing pipeline operations since at least 2014, aiming to spur wider natural gas distribution and upstream exploration.PetroChina owns 76% of the roughly 65,000 kilometers (40,000 miles) of midstream natural gas pipelines, while 10% is held by Sinopec and 6% by China National Offshore Oil, analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG said in a June report. The remaining are owned by provincial governments or independent operators, they said.Representatives for CLSA, the parent companies of Sinopec and PetroChina declined to comment, while Sasac and the parent of Cnooc didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for BOCI and CICC also didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.(Updates response from PetroChina’s parent company and CLSA in the final paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Carol Zhong and Feifei Shen.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Vinicy Chan in New York at vchan91@bloomberg.net;Crystal Tse in Hong Kong at ctse44@bloomberg.net;Steven Yang in Beijing at kyang74@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Fion Li at fli59@bloomberg.net, ;Shiyin Chen at schen37@bloomberg.net, Ramsey Al-RikabiFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clsa-boci-among-banks-chosen-030618830.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-30	2019-08-30 01:56:32	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	China Big Oil's Bet on Upstream Pays Off While Fuels Wither	(Bloomberg) -- China Big Oil wrapped up a first half that rewarded exploration & production and punished refining.PetroChina Co. and Cnooc Ltd. on Thursday posted stronger earnings, while Sinopec, the fuel-making behemoth, said earlier in the week that profit slid 24% from a year ago. All three delivered on commitments to increase spending, seeking to fulfill President Xi Jinping’s demand for higher energy output.Investors seemed pleased, especially with Cnooc’s cost cutting. The company led gains on the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong on Friday, rising as much as 6.5%. PetroChina added as much as 4.5%.Here are some highlights from their January-June results:Spending SpreeUnlike global titans such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp., who are keeping a tight rein on spending and returning cash to investors, China’s state-owned giants are splurging to expand output. While the trio aren’t yet at the midway mark of their annual capex targets -- spending tends to be concentrated in the second half -- they have significantly increased from last year.Growing OutputAll three are steadily increasing output, which hasn’t come easy considering that many of their oil fields back home are old and costly. That helps explains why they’re betting big on natural gas. Cnooc’s net production rose to a record in the first half, while PetroChina posted a double-digit growth in domestic gas supply. Gas output by Sinopec, officially known as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., gained 7% despite overall production rising just 0.9%.* NOTE: Table shows changes in first-half production from year ago.Trimming FatCnooc’s cost-cutting shone through. The offshore explorer further lowered its all-in cost to $28.99 a barrel from $31.83 a year ago, helping offset the impact of falling oil prices on its operations. “Cost control continues to be excellent,” analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said in a note.Gas Import PainPetroChina is getting some reprieve from importing natural gas. Those losses narrowed to the least since 2016, which the company attributed to higher domestic output trimming overseas purchases. The top producer sells gas to domestic users at state-controlled prices, which tend to be lower than its costs of importing gas through long-term supply contracts and pipelines from Central Asia.(Updates to add share prices in third paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Kari Lindberg and Dan Murtaugh.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Jasmine Ng in Singapore at jng299@bloomberg.net;Feifei Shen in Beijing at fshen11@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-big-oils-bet-upstream-015632992.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-17	2019-08-17 00:00:00	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	China’s Biggest Energy Company Shuns Venezuela Oil on Tighter U.S. Sanctions	(Bloomberg) -- China’s biggest energy company is backing away from direct purchases of Venezuelan crude as the Trump administration tightens sanctions against the South American nation.China National Petroleum Corp. has canceled plans to load about 5 million barrels worth of Venezuelan oil onto ships this month in the aftermath of the latest executive order by President Donald Trump, according to people with knowledge of the situation who asked not to be identified discussing proprietary information.CNPC joins Turkey’s largest bank, Ziraat Bank, which severed its relationship with Venezuela’s Central Bank following sanctions. The moves represent a setback for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has been counting on both China and Russia to keep the country going amid a humanitarian crisis, food shortages and hyperinflation.China became the top destination for Venezuelan crude after U.S. sanctions against state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA were announced at the end of January. Venezuela may run low on options without the help of CNPC to export oil, a main source of revenue that bankrolls the Maduro regime. The three August-loading cargoes canceled by CNPC’s subsidiary PetroChina Co. Ltd. haven’t so far attracted another buyer, according to reports seen by Bloomberg.PetroChina’s press office declined to comment on market speculation, citing company policy.On Aug. 5, Trump signed an executive order authorizing sanctions on anyone who provides support to Maduro. Opposition leader Juan Guaido, recognized by the Trump administration as the country’s leader, is backed by more than 50 countries.PetroChina’s pullback doesn’t mean China will completely turn away from Venezuelan oil. Other companies can continue to supply China’s independent refiners known as teapots with the South American nation’s crude, according to people familiar with the matter.China has been a staunch supporter of the Venezuelan government since its first oil-backed loan to late president Hugo Chavez. The Asian nation has loaned $50 billion in the past decade in exchange for oil. China, along with Russia, is one of 14 nations that support Maduro.This will be the first time in more than a decade that PetroChina forgoes Venezuelan crude, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China has imported 339,000 barrels a day of Venezuelan oil this year. Most of the barrels come via PetroChina, but in the wake of U.S. sanctions, Russia’s Rosneft Oil Co PJSC has stepped up to supply Venezuelan oil to the country’s independent refiners.&#92;--With assistance from Feifei Shen and Patricia Laya.To contact the reporters on this story: Lucia Kassai in Houston at lkassai@bloomberg.net;Alfred Cang in Singapore at acang@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Joe CarrollFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-biggest-energy-company-shuns-121342089.html?.tsrc=rss

Far more hurtful is the fact that PetroChina's market worth is now less than the value of its proven oil and gas reserves in the ground – which is estimated to be worth $208.7 billion.  American imports of manufactured goods from China and 13 other Asian countries rose 9 percent in 2018 to $816 billion, the largest annual increase in nearly a decade and outpacing a 6 percent increase in domestic manufacturing gross output.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/todays-pickup-once-1-trillion-154220759.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-07-09	2019-07-09 08:26:31	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	An Oil Behemoth Is Worth Less Than Its Energy Reserves In the Ground	(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.PetroChina Co. looks cheap on many levels, perhaps none more so than comparing it to the value of its reserves beneath the Earth’s surface.By plotting its enterprise value against reserves, China’s state-run oil and gas champion is the cheapest among global energy firms tracked by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Its shares have sunk 14% in Hong Kong this year to trade almost at the lowest since 2005. That’s despite a 19% gain in crude prices.“With PetroChina’s current assets and asset quality, even with modest valuation methods, the H-share price should be easily doubled from current levels,” Jefferies Group LLC analyst Laban Yu said by phone. “There is no valuation method that can validate the current share price.”That’s a sentiment shared by most analysts. The stock has drawn 20 buy ratings and only one sell. The consensus of more than 25 forecasters sees prospects for PetroChina to surge 42% over the next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“In theory, oil companies should never trade below their proven reserves value,” Bernstein analysts including Neil Beveridge said in a May 22 report. With PetroChina trading below that metric, it raises the question of how much lower it can get, Bernstein said.To truly unlock its potential requires a major jolt, such as a breakup of its assets or a management mindset shift to put the needs of shareholders on par with national service, analysts say. If PetroChina existed in the U.S., it would be worth about four times more than its current price of HK$4.20, according to Jefferies.$1 TrillionBeijing-based PetroChina was formed in 1999 after its parent China National Petroleum Corp. transferred most of its major upstream assets inherited from the former oil ministry. The company listed in Hong Kong a year later and in Shanghai in 2007, becoming the world’s first trillion-dollar company.As oil prices tumbled, PetroChina suffered more than its international peers. Its current market value of $169 billion makes it the fourth largest oil major after Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp. Confidence was also hurt by a corruption scandal in 2013 that led to the imprisonment of a few board members, including former chairman Jiang Jiemin.Oil companies typically trade at a premium to their reserve value to reflect the growth potential from those resources, according to Bernstein. PetroChina is a “noticeable outlier” among 25 global energy companies assessed, which is based on the value of proven reserves under current prices among other factors. Bernstein estimates PetroChina’s reserves are worth $208.7 billion.Lagging PeersPart of what ails PetroChina is endemic to the oil industry: back when oil prices were high, it piled up debt in chase of production growth. Return on capital, a popular measure of efficiency in oil companies, dropped from double-digit percentages in the 2000s to single digits in recent years.Its return on equity of 4.3% is at the bottom 5% of global integrated oil and gas companies, while its operating margin of 5.09% is lower than 65% of the majors, data compiled by Bloomberg show.“They pursued a strategy of volume growth at the expense of returns,” Beveridge said in a phone interview. “That’s obviously led to massive loss in shareholder value.”PetroChina also suffers from troubles specific to it being the nation’s top supplier. It is under pressure to increase spending this year, a good chunk of it on old or high-cost fields, after President Xi Jinping called for higher domestic oil and gas production. It also consistently loses money from reselling imported natural gas locally at lower, state-regulated prices -- a problem that has intensified amid booming consumption.Industry OverhaulReform could be around the corner. The Chinese government plans to combine the pipeline resources of PetroChina and its two other state-owned peers into a national operator. This could unlock value for PetroChina if those assets are worth more than what the company has them booked for, Beveridge said.The pipeline spinoff will provide clarity for investors as well as a short-term share price boost, Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. analysts including Dennis Ip said in a note Monday that initiates coverage of PetroChina with an outperform rating.The government is also revamping the upstream industry to make it easier for foreign companies to invest, and forcing producers to drill or lose exploration rights, according to Yu. That may push PetroChina to sign more production-sharing agreements, form joint ventures or spin off some other assets, Yu said.Beveridge highlighted Russia’s Gazprom PJSC as an example of how value can be unlocked when executives address shareholders’ needs. The company boosted dividends in May and followed that up by promising senior management changes. Its share price has jumped by more than 50% since.“Fundamental reform of the company, management and incentive schemes that are more focused on return-type metrics, that’s what’s needed to turn around the company,” Beveridge said. “If you do something positive for the shareholders, then you can start to unlock the upside.”(Updates shares throughout story.)To contact the reporters on this story: Dan Murtaugh in Singapore at dmurtaugh@bloomberg.net;Aibing Guo in Hong Kong at aguo10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Jasmine Ng, Charlie ZhuFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-behemoth-worth-less-energy-022856402.html?.tsrc=rss

The investment, which could eventually reach tens of millions of dollars, follows a new strategy to tap overseas retail margins as China's domestic fuel market is saturated.  The move follows a similar but larger investment in Brazil, where CNPC's global trading and refining unit bought 30% of a leading Brazilian fuel dealer last year.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-cnpc-breaks-myanmar-fuel-063054047.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-03	2019-05-03 16:37:46	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio	U.S. energy production has transformed since technology has allowed exploration and production (E&P) firms -- aka, upstream oil firms -- to use unconventional drilling methods to access oil reserves that were previously unreachable, or far too expensive to access.Also, these new techniques have allowed firms to get more out of each well and even recover oil left in conventionally drilled wells.What's more, because natural gas is usually present in oil pockets, natural gas is wildly abundant and the supply is so great that in the matter of a handful of years, the US has transformed from a net importer of oil and natural gas, to one of the largest exporters on the planet.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe U.S. is No. 1 exporter of gasoline in the world. And by 2024, according to IEA, it's projected that if the U.S. keeps up its oil export growth, it will surpass Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world top oil exporter.And the Permian Basin in Texas is leading the way.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Seven energy stocks to buy to light up your portfolio are featured below. Most are focused firms in one sector of the business; they're not the big diversified firms. This gives them even more growth potential. Energy Stocks to Buy: National Fuel Gas Co (NFG)Source: Shutterstock National Fuel Gas Co (NYSE:NFG) is a diversified natural gas company. It is not only an E&P firm, but also has storage, marketing and even utility operations.Generally you don't find a natural gas firm that does it all, unless you're looking at one of the big integrated energy firms. But NFG has been around since 1902, so it has had plenty of time to refine it business model. Most of its operations are in New York and Pennsylvania, where most of its customers are.It just reported Q1 earnings, which were in line with expectations. But the prospects for the sector are improving, and as more and more companies and consumers transition to natural gas from coal or oil (especially in NFG's service area) this will help boost demand. Also, as liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals start coming online, that will also boost business for NFG's various divisions.Its 2.9% dividend is a nice addition and its $5 billion market cap means it has a reliable business, come what may with the economy. CNOOC Ltd (CEO)Source: Shutterstock CNOOC Ltd (NYSE:CEO) is a Chinese E&P with operations all around the world.As China began to emerge as a world power, it began to expand its ability to sustain its growth. CEO was launched in 1999 and is now a major energy firm, with a nearly $80 billion market cap.Recently, its fortunes have been lackluster since the Chinese economy has been sputtering. But as recent economic numbers reveal, China's economy is recovering, and that means growing demand for energy.Also, as global demand ramps up, China will be one of the beneficiaries and that also equates to greater energy demand. Year to date the stock is up 15% and it delivers a 5%-plus dividend on top of that.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May It recently signed a deal with the Russians to drill for and transport natural gas from a Russian site in the Arctic. And also formed a JV with PetroChina (NYSE:PTR) to drill in the South China Sea. Black Stone Minerals LP (BSM)Source: Shutterstock Black Stone Minerals LP (NYSE:BSM) is in the minerals and royalty business. This is kind of like a real estate investment trust (REIT) for energy and minerals.Basically BSM buys properties -- it has properties in over 40 states -- and then leases them to E&P firms to develop and takes a royalty for the minerals (including oil and gas) taken from the properties.This means it doesn't have to spend a lot of money on all the manpower and equipment to explore for the oil, it's merely a landlord. And it's set up as a limited partnership, so investors are also part of the ownership and get paid their share of net income as a dividend payment. Right now, that dividend is paying out more than 8%.As this energy boom heats up in the U.S., demand for quality properties that aren't already bid to the moon to explore will increase. Because BSM has been acquiring properties for quite a while, it's now enjoying the fruits of decades-long labor.This can be a cyclical industry, and right now, BSM's time is arriving. It's also a tempting acquisition for larger integrated energy firms. ConocoPhillips (COP)Source: Shutterstock ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is the largest E&P company operating today. With operations all around the world, it has diversified its portfolio to take advantage of any inefficiencies in the market.The old saying &quot;make hay while the sun shines&quot; is especially appropriate for upstream firms today, as oil prices rise. This is their time, and it's no surprise that ConocoPhillips is looking to increase production 5% this year.A strong global economy means widespread demand increases for COP's customers.It recently reported Q1 earnings that beat expectations. Q4 was a stronger quarter for COP, but Q1 earnings this year still beat Q1 from last year, which is encouraging. Plus, energy prices are on the move so far in 2019, and that trend is likely to stay in place. Even if energy prices stay flat from here that will be good for COP.  * 7 Stocks That Are Soaring This Earnings Season Its dividend comes in just under 2%, but with a $70 billion market cap, this is a blue-chip E&P that will deliver during an upcycle, but won't be a heart-stopping ride compared to smaller E&Ps. Chesapeake Energy (CHK)Source:  Philadelphia 76ers Via FlickrChesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) was started by Tom Ward and the larger than life Aubrey McClendon. The latter also was part owner of the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder, which he brought to his home city from Seattle.Chesapeake was founded when both owners were in their late 20s, and they were some of the first people to take on unconventional drilling at their fledgling E&P firm. And as an MLP in the heyday of MLPs, CHK stock was a high-flier.But those days transitioned into a much tougher energy market and structural issues regarding MLPs and CHK business operations in general. When McClendon unexpectedly died in 2016, it also marked a slow decline in CHK stock's fortunes.But the company has endured and is now at bargain prices as oil and natural gas prices continue to rise. The stock is up 32% year to date. And given the consolidation in the upstream sector, this is a potential takeover candidate at this point. Berry Petroleum (BRY)Source: Shutterstock Berry Petroleum (NYSE:BRY) is a unique E&P firm in the sense that it primarily focuses its efforts in California and Utah. While there's plenty of talk about the shales in Texas, Montana and the Appalachians, Berry has the West.But there is a lot of oil and natural gas in California. It's just that the state has been more regulated about extraction techniques and that has made it tough to drill freely.Recent legislation has passed to alleviate some of the regulatory hurdles, and that has been to the great benefit of BRY. The stock is up nearly 32% in the past year, which shows that it has been a strong grower, even when prices collapsed at the end of 2018.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares Now, it's a much brighter picture and this would surely be a great acquisition at a premium. It will also continue to succeed on its own as well. And the 4.3% dividend is also a nice kicker. Cabot Oil & Gas (COG)Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG) an E&P firm that primarily focuses on the Marcellus Shale that runs from New York to Tennessee. COG concentrates most of its efforts in Pennsylvania.This is one of the most productive shales in the U.S., but its geography is a bit more challenging than the shales in west Texas like the Permian Basin. But that being said, there is plenty of opportunity and COG stock is taking full advantage.The stock has a slim 1.4% dividend, but the real opportunity here is rising energy prices and a decent sized company that is leverage to that price growth. Add to that the consolidation in the E&P sector right now and you have a good stock priced very well for the growth that is coming over the next quarters.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

The waivers blindsided the market, which had assumed America would bring Iranian exports to zero, and sparked a 40 percent collapse in crude.  Now, as the six-month waivers allowing buyers to ship limited quantities approach their expiry, the Saudis are pursuing aggressive output cuts, U.S. sanctions on Venezuela have further squeezed supplies and OPEC producers burned by last quarter’s oil slump are defying Trump’s call for lower prices.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-oil-waivers-rocked-market-015249927.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-01-07	2019-01-07 20:05:15	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	5 Chinese Stocks to Avoid Now (But Buy Later)	"2018 was not a good year for the Chinese stock market. The Shanghai composite, the market's major average, fell nearly 25%, the worst performance of any Asian stock market. Most Chinese stocks declined: of 86 China-based stocks listed on U.S. markets, according to a finviz.com screen, just 10 rose more than 1% in 2018.

It's far from certain that 2019 will be any better -- at least initially. Trade war concerns aren't going anywhere. Investors across the globe still are fearful of recession, re-igniting long-running fears of a &quot;hard landing&quot; in the Chinese economy, and thus Chinese stocks.

That said, there are some intriguing values in the Chinese stock market. Long-term, the movement of hundreds of millions of citizens into the middle class and beyond promises explosive economic growth. It may be a bumpy ride -- indeed, it already has been -- but a great deal of promise remains. These five Chinese stocks all look cheap relative to their potential. And after the Chinese stock market bottoms, they could be the biggest winners when the rebound comes.

### JD.com (JD)

Source:  Daniel Cukier via Flickr

E-commerce operator JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has had one of the steepest falls of any Chinese stock, dropping by nearly half in 2018. Investments behind the business have pressured earnings. The CEO wound mired in an ugly incident in the U.S. E-commerce leader Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has sold off -- albeit not the same extent -- adding to the pressure on second-place JD.com.

I've been a long-time bull on JD stock, which has been one of my favorite Chinese stocks. But amid the endless selling pressure, even I've waved the white flag. The &quot;risk-off&quot; attitude in the market and the lack of patience in JD.com's higher spending suggests it will take some time for investors to return to the bull case.

That said, I still believe that will happen at some point. JD.com has big-money partnerships with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), the latter of whom took a stake in JD.com at over $40 per ADS, nearly double the current price. The e-commerce market in China will be big enough for two winners, at least. And JD's better supply chain could allow it to take share from Alibaba over the long haul.

JD stock seemingly has bottomed over the past six weeks, so a rebound may be at hand. Near-term, investors still need to be careful: if support breaks again, the downtrend can resume. But at some point, I still believe JD will rebound.

### Nio (NIO)

Electric vehicle company NIO (NYSE:NIO) closed the year up under 2% from the price at which it went public in September. In the context of the overall market -- and the Chinese stock market -- over that stretch, the performance certainly isn't that bad.

But a seemingly &quot;cheap&quot; price above $6 belies how expensive NIO truly is. This is a company still valued at over $8 billion despite the fact that it doesn't yet manufacture its own vehicles. (NIO contracts with a state-owned manufacturer, and aims to get a license at some point.) A 3x multiple to 2019 revenue estimates doesn't sound that big, but it's certainly high for an automaker. The only other company with a similar valuation is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), to which NIO is often compared.

That said, there's an intriguing long-term bull case here, as I detailed last month. The near-term risks, however, seem huge in this market. Another market downturn and/or further pressure on Chinese stocks without question is going to take NIO stock down. Put selling can create a hedged entry -- and for investors willing to try and time the bottom, might be the wisest choice.

This seems like a story that could be huge -- but in this market, there also seems to be little reason to rush in.

### Huya (HUYA)

Source: Shutterstock 

Huya (NYSE:HUYA) is often referred to as China's version of video game streaming company Twitch, now owned by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Like NIO, Huya went public this year, with shares priced at $12. Unlike NIO, HUYA stock actually rose from those prices, closing the year above $15.

But that gain is small solace to most HUYA shareholders. The stock rose 300% out of the gates; it fell nearly 70% from highs above $50 to the end-of-year price. The chart still suggests a falling knife, and between competition from privately held Douyu and others, plus a 3x-plus multiple to 2019 revenue estimates, HUYA stock could have further to fall.

That said, here, too, there's a bull case worth buying. Video game demand in China continues to rise -- and should do so for years at a pace that exceeds even that of the U.S. The company has turned profitable already. And a buyout isn't out of the realm of possibility.

The risks here looks similar to those facing many issues in the Chinese stock market. The rewards, however, do not. A return even close to 2018 highs suggests huge upside for HUYA. And a heavy short interest, plus a thin float, means a short squeeze provides a potential catalyst once sentiment finally turns.

### PetroChina (PTR)

For a $200 billion company, PetroChina (NYSE:PTR) gets a surprisingly small amount of attention. What news there has been of late, however, certainly hasn't been good. PTR trades near its lowest levels in almost three years - and is only a few points away from touching a thirteen-year low.

It's not hard to see why that is. Oil prices are falling; the spike in natural gas is fading. Concerns about the Chinese economy are rising. If anything, it might seem surprising that PTR fell &quot;only&quot; 12% in 2018.

But those obvious risks also set up a potential case for a rebound. It's hard to think of any large-cap stock that could benefit more from a broad reversal in sentiment. If investor fear turns back to greed, oil bounces, Chinese stocks bounce and PTR could gain big. After all, the stock traded above $80 -- 30% or more above current levels as recently as early October.

### Baidu (BIDU)

Source: Shutterstock 

On this site in early November, Luke Lango laid out the value-based bull case for Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). Lango isn't alone: Wall Street analysts on average see over 50% upside for BIDU. And yet the stock has dropped another 20% in the last two months, closing out a year in which BIDU declined some 32%.

The bulls may not be wrong, however -- just early. The chart is ugly, and Baidu is going to need some help from the Chinese stock market to end its long decline. When that reversal comes, however, there's a lot to like here. BIDU trades at a mid-teen multiple to forward earnings despite heavy investments in the business and losses from iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ). Its search dominance seems assured. Like a lot of Chinese stocks, BIDU probably just needs some time for investor confidence to return.

As of this writing, Vince Martin has a bearish out-of-the-money options position in Tesla. He has no positions in any other securities mentioned.

2019-01-07	2019-01-07 12:30:02	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Has Short Interest in Suncor Changed?	"Suncor Is Trading at a Premium Despite Falling 30% in Q4

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Short interest in Suncor

Suncor Energy’s (SU) short interest (its percentage of outstanding shares) has risen 0.5% since October 1, the beginning of the fourth quarter, to 0.8%. Suncor stock has fallen 30.3%. A rise in short interest implies increased bearishness toward a stock.

## Why the change in sentiment?

Bearishness toward Suncor may have risen due to its lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings of 0.96 Canadian dollars and weak fourth-quarter earnings forecast, and the Government of Alberta’s announcement of production cuts. Despite the cuts, which aim to address the province’s supply glut, Suncor expects its production to grow by 10% in 2019. A rise in volumes could soften bearishness toward the stock.

In the fourth quarter, the company’s earnings could fall due to upstream earnings being impacted by lower oil prices. WTI has fallen 40% since October 1.

## Peers’ short interest

Since October 1, Suncor peers PetroChina (PTR), ExxonMobil (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) have seen their short interest rise by 0.1% to 0.2%, 0.8%, and 1.1%, respectively, and their stock prices fall 26.4%, 20.6%, and 12.7%.

The move is in line with a transformational strategy pushed by Sinochem chairman Ning Gaoning to zero in on core assets as it finalises a merger with ChemChina that will create the world's biggest industrial chemicals firm, worth around $120 billion (£94 billion).  It isn't yet clear what the valuation of the stake in the export-focused 200,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) West Pacific Petrochemical Corp (WEPEC) refinery will be, the people said.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-chinas-sinochem-transfer-wepec-042438644.html?.tsrc=rss

State-controlled PetroChina <601857.SS> expects June loadings from Venezuela, mainly the Merey grade, to be half the normal rates, according to two Beijing-based oil officials briefed on the matter.

2018-06-12	2018-06-12 22:00:12	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	China’s Pipeline Champion Misses an Opportunity	China’s plans to  create a pipeline giant to aid development of its natural gas market are overdue, and welcome.  The state-owned champion, provisionally dubbed China Pipelines Corp., will combine the pipeline divisions of state-owned PetroChina Co., China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. or Sinopec, and Cnooc Ltd. A mooted market capitalization of as much as 500 billion yuan ($78 billion) would make it the world’s largest pipeline operator on that measure, comfortably outstripping Enterprise Product Partners LP at $64 billion.  There’s much to like in that plan, given the way the current setup has helped stymie China’s drive to increase the role of gas in its domestic energy mix.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/4c031d72-e919-3665-8897-7896e2a47779/china%E2%80%99s-pipeline-champion.html?.tsrc=rss

2018-03-29	2018-03-29 08:05:17	PTR	PetroChina Company Limited	Exclusive: Firms complain of contaminated crude from U.S. reserve	Three firms that bought crude oil last year from U.S. emergency stockpiles raised concerns about dangerous levels of a poisonous chemical in the cargoes, according to internal Energy Department emails and shipping documents reviewed by Reuters.  Problems with crude quality would make the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) less useful in an emergency because refiners would need to spend time and money removing contamination before producing fuel.  Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) occurs naturally in crude and natural gas, but oil producers typically decontaminate such products before delivery to buyers.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-firms-complain-contaminated-crude-061531864.html?.tsrc=rss
