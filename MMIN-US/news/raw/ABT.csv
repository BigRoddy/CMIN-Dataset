The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year threw out a federal judge's order requiring AbbVie and partner Besins Pharmaceuticals to disgorge $448 million in profits to the Federal Trade Commission, but found that the judge had correctly determined that they had violated antitrust law."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-u-supreme-court-rebuffs-134733318.html?.tsrc=rss

The company in April said it projected EPS of at least $3.74 and adjusted EPS of at least $5.00 for the full year.

Abbott has developed 12 COVID-19 tests, which generated $2.2 billion in the first quarter of the year. Abbott's stock is up 6.5% for the year, while the broader S&P 500 has gained 11.9%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ab337de2-2684-36a5-9f9e-c7fc25c90451/abbott-adjusts-financial.html?.tsrc=rss

TAVR systems offer a less risky, minimally invasive alternative to open-heart surgery to treat aortic stenosis, where the aortic valve narrows and restricts blood flow out of the left ventricle to the aorta, weakening the heart muscle. The Navitor valve is implanted using Abbott’s FlexNav device, which received its CE mark last year. The catheter is designed to improve the flexibility and stability of other TAVR delivery devices and can be used in patients with aorta diameters as small as 5 millimeters. In the U.S., the Navitor system and FlexNav delivery device are only available for investigative use. Price Action: ABT shares closed 1.33% lower at $116.74 on Monday.

2021-05-14	2021-05-14 17:19:53	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	If You Do the Math, Senseonics Makes No Sense	While no one knows for sure what the recent rumblings in the major indices entails, looking at the bigger picture, the post-novel-coronavirus rally has been one of the most remarkable in history. Naturally, the bullishness extended to high-profitability potential growth investments like Senseonics (NYSEAMERICAN:SENS). As a play on the science, Senseonics is brilliant. As a portfolio booster, SENS stock might be a disaster. Source: Shutterstock About the only thing that could change the last sentence is if you were short the medical technology firm. To be clear, I’m not recommending you short Senseonics shares, since that brings up another level of variability and risk. However, I am asking you to consider — as an idea, not advice — to sell SENS stock. Perhaps not all of it, but take some profits off the table while you still can. Before I get deluged with hate mail, let’s go over why the idea of dumping SENS stock arouses intense anger. Fundamentally, I can understand the argument that Sensenoics is a game changer for diabetes patients. In the old paradigm, patients had to endure frequent and often painful finger pricks to monitor their blood-sugar levels. On the other hand, Senseonics provides freedom through its long-term continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips You can read the literature yourself, but to provide a very quick summary, medical professionals insert a sensor underneath the patient’s skin. This enables frequent, accurate monitoring of blood-sugar levels for 90 days (via the Eversense 90-Day CGM System), doing away with finger pricks entirely. Further, as our own Mark Hake predicted recently, “My thesis is that SENS stock will recover once the FDA allows Senseonics to start selling its device in the U.S.” Further, Hake mentions that Senseonics can follow in the footsteps of another CGM company, DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM). 10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks for Your Reliability Short List It’s possible. Is it probable? The market doesn’t agree. SENS Stock Is a High-Risk, Low-Probability Trade You might recall that a week or so ago, one of the biggest headlines was that debris from a Chinese rocket might land somewhere on populated parts of earth. Worse yet, experts didn’t know exactly where the debris would land until hours before impact. Amid the cacophony, I appreciated one scientist’s voice of reason. The world is about 70% water, so the chances of the debris landing on people are minimal. In other words, you have bigger problems to worry about. And that expert was right. Sure, the debris killing people made for great headlines. After all, if it bleeds, it leads. But sometimes, you must push away sensationalism and simply run the numbers. That’s really the thesis for SENS stock that matters. For instance, medical equipment giant Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has a CGM called FreeStyle Libre. I’m not sure if this CGM is better than Senseonics’ CGM. But you know what? It doesn’t matter. The market wants ABT, not SENS stock. Look at the variance in the shares available on Abbott’s bid-ask spread. At time of writing, 10% more shares are available at the bid of $118.53 than the ask of $118.51. Put simply, more buyers exist than sellers, which suggests (though not guarantees) that ABT will move higher. My InvestorPlace colleague mentioned DexCom. Here, the situation is way starker, with nearly 38% more shares available at a $334.41 bid than an ask of $334.78. It implies again that DXCM will move higher. Unfortunately, Senseonics is a completely different story. In this case, nearly 36% more shares are available at a $1.91 ask than at a $1.90 bid. Stated another way, it’s the opposite of the current housing market: Way more people want to sell than want to buy. The Math, Not the Feels Naturally, the guttural reaction to the above is that people who are selling SENS stock are idiots. Further, I’m an idiot. Nevertheless, my idiocy has no bearing on free market dynamics. In fact, I could write the most beautifully crafted bullish (or bearish) argument for SENS stock. Folks, it’s not going to change the wide discrepancy in the shares offered on the bid-ask spread. Definitely, it won’t change a discrepancy like this. But this is a lesson on proper investing strategies, if you want to hear it. Idiots or not, the market is dumping SENS stock — and they want to dump some more! If you feel that’s a bullish case for Senseonics, you’re taking a huge risk. For me, I’m staying away with 10-foot pole.

The company had sales of $10.4 billion for the quarter, up from $7.7 billion in the first quarter of 2020, against a FactSet consensus of $10.7 billion.

2021-04-08	2021-04-08 17:38:03	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott's Upgraded TriClip Heart Valve System OK'd In Europe	Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) won European approval for the latest generation of its TriClip system, a transcatheter-based repair device designed to stem leaks in the heart’s tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve opens and closes a set of three flaps rather than two. Because of that complexity, patients with tricuspid valve problems have had fewer treatment options. The company’s MitraClip helped treat mitral regurgitation, or the blood’s backflow through the valve with each heartbeat. The upgraded TriClip works in the same way, but now it allows clinicians to tailor the procedure to each patient’s valve using a range of four sizes to hold together a portion of its flaps. It also includes a new, steerable delivery system that lets surgeons independently grasp leaflets before fastening. The CE mark for the new version, dubbed TriClip G4, comes one year after it was first approved in Europe. It also recently received Canadian approval, but the device has not yet been approved in the U.S. Price Action: ABT shares are down 0.13% at $119.95 during market trading hours on the last check Thursday.

2021-04-01	2021-04-01 11:32:31	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott’s BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Self Test Cleared For Emergency Use In US	Abbott’s BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Self Test, which was designed to detect COVID-19 infection, has been authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The approval permits over-the-counter, non-prescription, and asymptomatic use of the test for individuals with or without symptoms. Abbott (ABT) expects the shipping of the tests to major food, drug and mass merchandiser retailers to begin in the coming weeks and the test to be accessible through some of their online store websites at a reasonable price. The test can be performed on children as young as two years old. Notably, the test will come in a two-count box in order to meet serial (frequent) testing requirements. The BinaxNOW professional test was launched nationwide in Aug. 2020 and Abbott increased the production at its new US manufacturing facilities to produce 50 million tests per month. Notably, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) bought the company’s first 150 million tests, and sent them to K-12 schools, nursing homes, historically black colleges and universities, and underserved communities, to help in preventing the virus from spreading. After receiving approval, BinaxNOW has also been used by workplaces, K-12 schools and universities, and other organizations all over the country, the company said. Abbott CEO Robert B. Ford said, “We’ve now accomplished what we set out to do when we launched BinaxNOW, which is to bring an accurate, affordable and readily available test to the American people that they can have on hand, whether they want to test frequently or in certain circumstances.” (See Abbott stock analysis on TipRanks) “Together with vaccines, the BinaxNOW Self Test will help Americans get back to doing what they want and need to do – like going to work and school or seeing friends and family – with greater confidence,” Ford added. On March 11, Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford increased the stock’s price target to $130 (8.5% upside potential) from $126 and reiterated a Buy rating. According to Bedford, “ABT has paused on concerns around 1) the slowdown in CV-testing and 2) their perceived ability to drive double-digit EPS growth in 2022.” “We are comfortable with these concerns, and believe this dynamic is more than accounted for in the valuation, which, on a relative basis, is as attractive as it has been in three years,” the analyst added. The consensus rating among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 9 Buys versus 1 Hold. The average analyst price target stands at $134.89 and implies upside potential of 12.6% to current levels over the next 12 months. Shares have gained 56.5% over the past year. What’s more, Abbott scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

2021-03-08	2021-03-08 14:22:34	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	What Does Abbott's Debt Look Like?	Shares of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) rose by 9.84% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Abbott Laboratories has. Abbott Laboratories's Debt Based on Abbott Laboratories's balance sheet as of February 19, 2021, long-term debt is at $18.53 billion and current debt is at $220.00 million, amounting to $18.75 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $6.84 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $11.91 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Abbott Laboratories has $72.55 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.26. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-03-08	2021-03-08 09:04:46	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott’s Alinity m Resp-4-Plex Test Cleared For Emergency Use In US; Street Says Buy	Abbott’s Alinity m Resp-4-Plex molecular assay, which was designed to test for four viruses in one test, has been authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Shares of the global healthcare company gained 1.1% to close at $117.25 on March 5. The Alinity m Resp-4-Plex test was introduced by Abbott (ABT) for detecting and differentiating SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in one test. This test will act as a rescuer as these four viruses have similar symptoms but need different treatments, the company said. Notably, the test is CE-marked and accessible in countries outside of the US. Abbott Rapid and Molecular Diagnostics EVP Andrea Wainer said, “This newest test will allow for fast and efficient diagnosis and triage of patients who present with respiratory symptoms so they can be given the right care.” The company has also received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 test to detect individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, but have no symptoms of COVID-19 infection. (See Abbott stock analysis on TipRanks) On Jan. 28, BTIG analyst Marie Thibault upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold and maintained a price target of $140 (19.4% upside potential), following “a strong Q4 result, a blockbuster Diagnostics revenue result that beat consensus by more than $1B, and a bullish outlook for both 2021 and 2022 EPS.” Given the company’s “faster growth rate for both sales and EPS, as well as its healthy balance sheet,” Thibault believes “ABT deserves to trade at a premium to the large-cap comp group.” Abbott shares have exploded 52.2% over the past year, while the stock still scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 9 Buys versus 1 Hold. That’s alongside an average analyst price target of $134.70, which implies almost 15% upside potential to current levels. Furthermore, Abbott scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

2021-03-02	2021-03-02 21:35:46	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott Announces HIV Vaccine Research Findings: 'Another Step Toward Unlocking A Cure'	"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) has announced a potential research breakthrough that could lead to advancements and potential vaccines for the treatment of HIV. What Happened: Abbott’s researchers have joined a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the Université Protestante au Congo in studying approximately 10,000 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo who have tested positive for HIV antibodies but have low to non-detectable viral load counts that occurred without the use of antiretroviral treatment. Why It's Important: These new findings, which were published Tuesday in EBioMedicine — part of The Lancet — could offer a significant new lead in mitigating the HIV crisis. An estimated 76 million people have been infected with HIV since the disease was first identified, and 38 million people today are living with the virus. Furthermore, the DRC is home to the oldest known HIV strains, which provides further insight into the disease’s origins. ""Global surveillance work keeps us ahead of emerging infectious diseases — and in this instance we realized we had found something that could be another step toward unlocking a cure for HIV,"" said Michael Berg, an associate research fellow in infectious disease research at Abbott and lead author of the study. ""The global research community has more work to do — but harnessing what we learn from this study and sharing it with other researchers puts us closer to new treatments that could possibly eliminate HIV.""

2021-03-02	2021-03-02 13:05:00	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott says researchers in the Democratic Republic of Congo have made findings that could lead to HIV vaccine	"Medical device, diagnostics and generic drug maker Abbott said Tuesday a team of scientists has found an unusually high number of people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with controlled HIV and said they could be a key to advancing therapies, or even developing a vaccine. The people in question test positive for HIV antibodies, but have low to non-detectable viral load counts, without using antiretroviral treatment, Abbott said in a statement. The findings were published in EbioMedicine, part of the prestigious medical journal The Lancet. They ""may help researchers uncover biological trends within this population that could lead to advancements in HIV treatments -- and potentially vaccines,"" said the statement. Researchers from Abbott, working with Johns Hopkins University, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the Université Protestante au Congo found the prevalence of HIV elite controllers was 2.7% to 4.3% in the DRC, compared with 0.1% to 2.0% worldwide. ""The finding of a large group of HIV elite controllers in the DRC is significant considering that HIV is a life-long, chronic condition that typically progresses over time,"" said Tom Quinn, M.D., director of Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health, and chief of the International HIV/AIDS Research Section of the NIAID. ""There have been rare instances of the infection not progressing in individuals prior to this study, but this high frequency is unusual and suggests there is something interesting happening at a physiological level in the DRC that's not random."" Abbott shares were slightly higher premarket, but have gained 50% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 has gained 26%."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/594042af-492d-3277-98f1-5ed756397db9/abbott-says-researchers-in.html?.tsrc=rss

(NYSE: DPZ) announced its corporate and U.S. franchise-owned stores raised $13 million in 2020 to support St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. What Happened: According to the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based company, more than $10.2 million of the funds were collected during its 17th annual St. Jude Thanks and Giving campaign, which was held Oct. 19, 2020, through Jan. 3, 2021. The remaining $2.8 million was collected during 2020 by asking customers to round up their order total and donate the difference to the St. Jude organization. Domino's selected St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as its national philanthropic partner in 2004. To date, it has raised more than $68 million. Last year was a record-breaking one for Domino's fundraising on behalf of St. Jude, topping its 2019 peak of $10 million raised, which itself broke the 2018 record of $9.8 million. What's Next: Last September, Domino's announced a commitment to raise $100 million for St. Jude by 2030; Domino said its pledge is the largest corporate commitment in the history of St. Jude. The company is also preparing to begin construction on The Domino's Village, a 140-unit housing facility for the families of children receiving medical treatment at St. Jude. The Domino's Village is expected to open in spring 2023. ""During a particularly challenging year, I am in awe of the generosity of our brand's customers during the annual St. Jude Thanks and Giving campaign,"" said Ritch Allison, Domino's CEO. ""The record number of funds raised in stores this year speaks volumes about not only the dedication of Domino's team members and customers, but also the groundbreaking work done by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.""

2021-02-05	2021-02-05 07:00:03	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Dems, Biden to Talk Stimulus; India’s Covax Haul: Virus Update	(Bloomberg) -- Top Democrats from the U.S. House of Representatives will meet with President Joe Biden on Friday after the Senate backed a non-binding call to oppose stimulus checks for upper-income taxpayers. Johnson & Johnson asked U.S. drug regulators to clear its experimental Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, which would give the U.S. a third vaccine.India is set to receive the largest number of Covid-19 vaccine doses in the initial distribution from the World Health Organization’s Covax initiative, despite the fact that the country’s current supply of shots outstrips demand. The U.K. government said a mandatory quarantine for travelers will start Feb. 15, fleshing out a policy announced last month.When might life around the world return to normal? In 7.4 years, at today’s vaccine rates.Key Developments:Global Tracker: Cases approach 104.9 million; deaths near 2.3 millionVaccine Tracker: More than 119 million shots given worldwideSuper Bowl crowd presents an experiment in Covid immunityWhat the future of restaurants might look likeThe $9.2 trillion price tag for failing to vaccinate the worldBin Laden, robot conspiracy theories test Pakistan vaccine driveBrace yourself: Long-haul travel may not get going until 2023Subscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg’s Prognosis team here. Click CVID on the terminal for global data on cases and deaths.AstraZeneca Applies for Japan Vaccine Approval: Report (2:58 p.m. HK)AstraZeneca applied to Japan’s health ministry Friday for approval for its Covid-19 vaccine, Nikkei reported, without attribution. The company still needs to submit clinical data in March, the report said.French, German Leaders Comment on Lockdowns (2:42 p.m. HK)French Prime Minister Jean Castex said it’s not possible to ease Covid-19 restrictions yet, but the situation doesn’t justify imposing a fresh lockdown.“We have kept the epidemic under control while preserving the economic and social life of our country as much as possible,” Castex said Thursday in a weekly news conference to update the nation on the health situation and examine whether current measures are effective.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in an interview with RTL Media Group it’s still too soon to ease the lockdown in Europe’s largest economy, even as the pandemic shows signs of ebbing. She’ll meet regional German leaders next week to discuss whether to continue current restrictions, which include shuttered bars, restaurants and most retailers, beyond Feb. 14. Lancet Study Recommends Weekly Testing in U.S. (2:24 p.m. HK)Until vaccines are widely available, weekly Covid-19 testing plus a two-week isolation period for positive cases may be the most cost-effective strategy to tackle the spread of the virus in the U.S. when transmission is high, a study by The Lancet found.Even monthly testing across the U.S., requiring 12 million tests a day, would be more cost-effective than the current approach of testing only people with symptoms and their close contacts, the medical journal said.Von der Leyen Acknowledges Vaccine-Strategy Flaw (1:50 p.m. HK)Ursula von der Leyen said she underestimated the complications that can arise in the production of coronavirus vaccines, Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, citing an interview with the European Commission president.“We focused very much on the development of a vaccine,” she said. “In retrospect, we should have thought more about the challenges of mass production in parallel.”Celltrion Treatment Gets Conditional Approval in Korea (1:26 p.m. HK)South Korea’s drug safety ministry approved Celltrion’s Covid-19 treatment for high-risk patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms. The approval is under the condition that Celltrion submits results of its Phase 3 clinical trial.Pfizer Withdraws Emergency Use Request in India: Report (1:22 p.m. HK)Pfizer has withdrawn an application for emergency-use authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine in India, Reuters reporter Krishna Das tweeted, citing an unidentified spokeswoman. Pfizer reportedly made the decision after understanding what additional information India’s regulator requires.Philippines to Require Masks in All Vehicles (1:20 p.m. HK)The Philippines will make it mandatory to wear masks inside all vehicles, even for passengers from the same household, the Transport and Health Departments said in a statement. Only drivers traveling alone may remove masks, while violators face fines, according to the statement.Brazil in Talks for 20 Million More Sinovac Shots: Reuters (1:11 p.m. HK)Brazil in talks to buy 20 million more doses of the Sinovac Biotech coronavirus vaccine, Reuters reported, citing an interview with Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria. The order will be on top of 100 million vaccine doses secured by Butantan biomedical institute, Doria said.Valneva Eyes Head-to-Head Advanced Trial For Vaccine (1:05 p.m. HK)Valneva SE is looking at running a head-to-head trial with an approved Covid-19 vaccine for advanced tests of its own shot in the U.K., where the rapid rollout of immunizations could make it hard to conduct a conventional study using a placebo.The French pharmaceutical company is in discussions with regulators about whether volunteers in the control arm of the trial, planned to start in April, could be given a coronavirus shot that has already been authorized, Chief Executive Officer Thomas Lingelbach said. The company is planning to enroll about 4,000 people in its late-stage trials in the U.K. and aims for approval in the last quarter of 2021.U.K. Variant Found in Melbourne Before Australian Open (12:53 p.m. HK)More than 500 members of the Australian Open tennis cohort received negative Covid-19 test results Friday after a quarantine hotel worker contracted the virus. Host city Melbourne had all but eliminated the virus until a local case of the B.1.1.7 variant was detected in a worker at a hotel where players quarantined.The isolation for more than 24 hours of players, officials and support staff who were staying at the Grand Hyatt added to already disrupted preparation for the tournament, which begins Feb. 8.AMLO Says in Good Health While Recovering From Covid (11:21 a.m. HK)Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said a Covid antigen test he took returned a negative result. AMLO, as the president is commonly known, posted a video online saying he’s in good health as he recovers from Covid-19.India Gets Lion’s Share of Covax Shots Despite Tepid Demand (10:32 a.m. HK)India is set to receive the largest numberof Covid-19 vaccine doses -- 97.2 million shots -- in the first tranche of distribution from the World Health Organization’s Covax initiative, despite the fact that supply in the country currently appears to outstrip demand.The Covax initiative, aimed at creating equitable global access to Covid vaccines especially for developing countries, is planning to distribute 337.2 million doses at the end of this month, the first delivery of some 2 billion shots it’s ordered so far.According to an interim distribution forecast published Wednesday, the second-biggest tranche of 17.2 million shots will go to Pakistan, followed by 16 million doses to Nigeria and 13.7 million to Indonesia. North Korea will receive 2 million shots.The large allocation to India is likely to raise eyebrows given that the country currently seems to have plenty of shots, but few takers. Only around half of those eligible to get vaccinated in its inoculation drive have come forward, and local media reports say that India producer Serum Institute of India is sitting on over 55 million doses and has temporarily halted production.Post-Coup Myanmar Kicks Off Vaccination Drive (10:12 a.m. HK)Myanmar is set to kick off vaccination for the general public Friday, starting with townships with the highest number of infections and mortality rate, according to Khin Khin Gyi, director of emerging infectious disease at the Ministry of Health and Sports. The initial phase will prioritize those 65 and above.Myanmar’s military, which seized power in a coup earlier this week, has vowed to inoculate 38.4 million people 18 and older by the end of this year. The administration expects the first batch of 30 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine ordered from the Serum Institute of India to arrive next week and 27 million doses from the Covax facility from March.Tokyo Survey Shows 0.91% Have Covid Antibodies (10:03 a.m. HK)A survey conducted by Japan’s Health Ministry in December found 0.91% of people in Tokyo have Covid-19 antibodies, up from 0.1% in a June tally. The survey showed a rate of 0.58% in Osaka and 0.54% in Aichi prefecture.House Dems to Meet Biden After Senate Move on Stimulus (9:33 a.m. HK)Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other U.S. House of Representatives leaders will meet with President Joe Biden on Friday after the Senate backed by 99-1 a non-binding call to oppose stimulus checks going to “upper-income taxpayers” -- part of the complex process of preparing Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan for passage through Congress.The amendment to the fiscal 2021 budget resolution doesn’t define the income cutoff for stimulus checks, but serves as a test vote for senators to gauge support on tightening the requirements.FDA Limits Emergency Use Authorization for Plasma (9:11 a.m. HK)The U.S. Food and Drug Administration revised its Emergency Use Authorization for convalescent plasma, limiting its use to hospitalized patients early in the disease. The convalescent plasma used must contain high levels of antibodies.The EUA was updated based on data from more recent clinical trials since the original order was issued in August, the agency said in a statement. The original authorization produced an embarrassing episode for then-FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, who had to walk back comments he made exaggerating the benefit of convalescent plasma. Plasma with low levels of antibodies has not been shown to be helpful in treating Covid-19 and is no longer authorized for use in treatment, the FDA said.Canada Extends Cruise-Ship Ban to February 2022 (9:03 a.m. HK)Canada extended its ban on cruise ships through February 2022 because of Covid-19, effectively shutting down popular summer trips to Alaska for another year. The prohibition will allow authorities to focus on vaccine rollout and limit the spread of new variants, the government said in a statement.The decision is a setback for an industry trying to get back in business after being in dry dock for almost a year. While Alaska is one of the industry’s top destinations, the ban will also affect New England cruises that travel north to Montreal and other stops.China Gets Northern Outbreak Under Control (8:50 a.m. HK)China appears to have controlled a virus resurgence in its northern regions, with new local cases reported at just six Friday, from 135 on Jan. 14. Overall, China’s winter wave -- concentrated in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Hebei -- numbers more than 2,000 infections.While there were concerns that infections would seep into the Beijing ahead of Lunar New Year and national political meetings scheduled for March, the capital has recorded only 44 cases so far. Still, officials remain on high alert and have discouraged travel during the Lunar New Year holiday that starts Feb. 11, while tightening restrictions on people entering Beijing.U.K. to Start Mandatory Quarantine for Travelers Feb. 15 (8:15 a.m. HK)The U.K. will require travelers from coronavirus hot spots to quarantine starting Feb. 15, the government said, adding flesh to a policy first announced last month.Arrivals from countries on the U.K.’s travel ban list will be required to isolate for 10 days in government-approved accommodation, the Department for Health and Social Care said Thursday. The government is seeking bids from hotels near airports and ports to support the program.FDA Says Variants Won’t Mean Back to Square One (7:32 a.m. HK)The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is working with industry to ensure that updated vaccines for Covid-19 variants are deployed as quickly as possible, Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock said. The option of “streamlined” clinical trials for altered vaccines is under discussion, she said.“We do not believe there will be the need to start at square one with any of these products,” Woodcock said. “We do not want to create obstacles to getting these tools to the frontlines.”The FDA is building on experience with vaccines for other evolving infections diseases, such as the flu, she said.U.S. Consumer Bureau to Restart Data Collection (7:26 a.m. HK)The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will resume data collection from mortgage lenders and credit card companies that was halted earlier in the pandemic. The directives are part of a broader CFPB effort to study the pandemic’s impacts on consumers and boost racial equality.In March 2020, the CFPB gave banks and other companies a break from reporting data under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the CARD Act, which governs credit cards. In a blog post Thursday, the acting director said the bureau would soon begin collecting that data again, as well as information related to small business lending and other loans.Vaccine Maker SK Bioscience Gets Preliminary IPO Approval (7:23 a.m. HK)SK Bioscience is eligible to list shares after preliminary review, Korea Exchange said Thursday, without giving further details. SK Chemicals holds 98% of SK Bioscience, one of the manufacturers of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine.J&J Seeks Emergency Vaccine Clearance in U.S. (5:49 p.m. NY)Johnson & Johnson asked U.S. drug regulators to clear its experimental Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, setting up what’s likely to be a fast-moving review process that could lead to millions more doses becoming available for the immunization drive within weeks.The drugmaker said Thursday it had filed an application for emergency-use authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The shot would give the U.S. a third vaccine to try to halt a pandemic that has killed more than 450,000 Americans.The agency scheduled a Feb. 26 meeting where outside advisers will consider the request and make a recommendation about whether to grant it. While their decision isn’t binding, it would be unusual for the FDA to reject the experts’ advice.Novavax Begins Rolling Review in U.S. (5:20 p.m. NY)Regulators in the U.S. have begun to review certain data required for clearance of Novavax Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine while final-phase clinical trials are still underway, the company said.The process, called a rolling submission, has also begun in the U.K. and Canada, Novavax said. On Wednesday, the company said European regulators were doing a similar review.School Testing Experiment Hits Snarls (3:35 p.m. NY)A pilot project in which rapid Covid-19 tests were used in an effort to reopen some U.S. schools has encountered administrative and logistical hurdles, according to a report Thursday.Through a collaboration between the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Rockefeller Foundation, the project received about 140,000 quick-turnaround Covid tests from Abbott Laboratories. Even with access to testing from the outset, schools needed additional resources like staffing to perform the tests.U.S. Restrictions Easing (2:58 p.m. NY)Around the U.S., restrictions are relaxing as the outbreak eases:Massachusetts will increase capacity limits at business like restaurants and gyms to 40% from 25%Rhode Island is allowing weddings to have as many as 50 guests, and indoor dining now can include two householdsArkansas won’t extend a directive requiring bars and restaurants selling alcohol to close at 11 p.m.Michigan will allow high school sports leagues to restart practices and competitions. Masks will be requiredPuerto Rico will shorten its nighttime curfew by an hour -- the new schedule is midnight to 5 a.m. -- and allow many businesses to operate at 50% capacityDenver began accepting applications for a program that encourages businesses to add Covid-19 safety measures beyond what’s required by public health orders, helping businesses expand operational capacityNYC Is Denied Shifting First Vaccine Doses for Second (11:44 a.m. NY)New York’s state health commissioner denied New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s request to start using vaccine doses that have been reserved for second doses. The city currently has around 320,000 doses on hand that have been reserved for second doses. De Blasio has said these doses sit in storage for weeks and could be used for first doses.Responding to a Feb. 3 letter from the mayor, Commissioner Howard Zucker said Thursday the Biden administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently don’t recommend using second doses as first doses. Meanwhile, New York City vaccine sites are up and running after a snowstorm shut them down for a few days, de Blasio said.BOE Sees Rapid U.K. Rebound Following Vaccine Push (7:41 a.m. NY)The Bank of England said the U.K. economy is heading for a rapid pickup in light of a bold vaccination effort. Despite lowering its outlook for the year, the central bank sounded an optimistic note on its hopes of a powerful rebound. Officials also kept monetary stimulus in place and agreed as a contingency that banks should prepare for the possibility of negative interest rates.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/restrictions-ease-u-j-j-230244017.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-27	2021-01-27 14:54:42	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	P/E Ratio Insights for Abbott Laboratories	In the current session, Abbott Laboratories Inc. (NYSE:ABT) is trading at $115.15, after a 0.39% gain. Over the past month, the stock increased by 6.35%, and in the past year, by 29.28%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 0.22%. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.

Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 121.72 in the Health Care Equipment & Supplies industry, Abbott Laboratories Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 61.03. Shareholders might be inclined to think that the stock might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.

Abbott Laboratories's Debt According to the Abbott Laboratories's most recent balance sheet as reported on November 4, 2020, total debt is at $18.56 billion, with $18.35 billion in long-term debt and $214.00 million in current debt. Adjusting for $4.48 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $14.08 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Abbott Laboratories has $69.04 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.27. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Why Investors Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-01-26	2021-01-26 15:10:45	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Earnings Preview: Abbott Laboratories	"On Wednesday, January 27, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) will release its latest earnings report. Check out Benzinga's preview to understand the implications. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Based on management's projections, Abbott Laboratories analysts model for earnings of $1.35 per share on sales of $9.94 billion. Abbott Laboratories reported a profit of $0.95 per share when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $8.31 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on ABT If the company were to match the consensus estimate, earnings would be up 42.11%. Sales would be up 19.56% from the year-ago period. Abbott Laboratories's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 0.90 0.41 0.58 0.95 EPS Actual 0.98 0.57 0.65 0.95 Revenue Estimate 8.51 B 6.75 B 7.34 B 8.26 B Revenue Actual 8.85 B 7.33 B 7.73 B 8.31 B Stock Performance Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 28.9%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders can relax going into this earnings release. Long-term shareholders are already enjoying 12-month gains prior to the announcement. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Abbott Laboratories is scheduled to hold the call at 09:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.

The decision significantly increases the number of people eligible for insurance coverage for mitral valve repair with MitraClip, enabling broader access to the device. As the first and only TEER device approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and reimbursed by Medicare for primary mitral regurgitation, physicians have increasingly relied on the therapy to improve survival and quality of life for their patients.

The test was less sensitive in detecting asymptomatic infection, but the CDC study found that the faster turnaround time can help limit transmission by more rapidly identifying infectious persons for isolation.  Several rapid antigen tests have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, but data lacks on test performance in asymptomatic people, according to a team of scientists from CDC's COVID-19 Response Team and the Arizona Department of Health Services.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbotts-covid-19-antigen-test-185353814.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-19	2021-01-19 11:08:20	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott vs Dexcom: Which “Strong Buy” Stock Could Deliver Higher Returns in 2021?	With multiple COVID-19 vaccines being distributed across the world, companies focused on other medical conditions are now grabbing the Street's attention. One such disorder is diabetes, which is growing rapidly worldwide—sedentary lifestyles being a key reason for that. A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that deaths from diabetes surged 70% globally between 2019 and 2020. Abbott and Dexcom are some of the names that are developing diabetes monitoring systems. Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we will place Abbott and Dexcom alongside each other and pick the stock reflecting a more compelling play. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Abbott has a diversified business that includes four segments: Medical Devices, Diagnostics, Nutrition and Established Pharmaceutical Products (which generates revenue from the sale of branded generic pharmaceutical products outside of the US). Since the pandemic's onset, Abbott has been in the news for the multiple COVID-19 tests developed by the company. Most recently, BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Test Card was granted the FDA’s emergency use authorization for virtually guided at-home use. Coming to diabetes, Abbott sees tremendous growth in the area, especially through its FreeStyle Libre technology, which is a sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system. Sales of FreeStyle Libre systems grew 37.9% in 3Q 2020. Moreover, in 3Q 2020, the company’s FreeStyle Libre 3 system secured CE Mark for use by diabetic patients in Europe. The FreeStyle Libre 3 provides real-time glucose readings automatically delivered to the user’s smartphone every minute, offering unsurpassed 14-day accuracy and real-time glucose alarms. The company also won CE Mark for its Libre Sense Glucose Sport Biosensor, which helps athletes “better understand the efficacy of their nutritional choices on training and athletic performance.” Furthermore, Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre 2 received approval in December 2020 by Health Canada for adults and children (4 and older) with diabetes. (See ABT stock analysis on TipRanks) Last month, Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford reiterated a Buy rating for Abbott following a call with the company’s management. Bedford stated that the company is working through the reimbursement channels in Europe and expects to launch Libre 3 in the “coming months,” while the analyst had anticipated a December launch. Bedford also specified that management did not lay out a timeline for Libre 3 roll out in the US, but he estimates the launch could happen in 2021. The analyst also noted that the app for the Libre 2 system has not yet been approved, but management is optimistic about the submission. Commenting on the prospects of the COVID-19 testing portfolio, Abbott’s management anticipates the testing market to remain strong into mid-2021 and then start to decline in the second half of this year. To back his bullish stance on Abbott, the analyst concluded, “The 'third wave' of CV-19 has raised the near-term uncertainty level (for the group), but ABT remains well positioned given its diversified portfolio, and the CV-19 testing tailwind, which lessens the near-term risk profile. Management is executing well, and enters 2021 with momentum.” Overall, consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 8 Buys versus 2 Holds. Abbott shares have risen 25.1% over the past year and the average price target of $120.57 suggests upside potential of 8.3% in the months ahead. Dexcom (DXCM) Diabetes is growing rapidly and so is the need for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, which Dexcom specializes in. The company's G6 CGM system is FDA-permitted for use by people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Last week, the company announced better-than-anticipated preliminary results for 4Q 2020, which calls for revenue to meet or exceed $567 million. This implies year-over-year growth of 23%, with U.S. revenue expected to rise about 20% to $451 million and international revenue to grow about 33% to $116 million. (See DXCM stock analysis on TipRanks) Overall, the company expects to meet or exceed revenue of $1.925 billion in 2020, reflecting a gain of over 30%. As for the initial 2021 outlook, Dexcom calls for top-line growth in the range of 15%-20%. The company’s outlook is based on an increase in its sensor volumes, driven by the growing CGM awareness for people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, continued expansion beyond the US, shifting channel mix and overall market dynamics. Covering Dexcom for Oppenheimer, analyst Steven Lichtman notes that the company’s international business was the primary driver of the revenue beat, owing to new initiatives including direct-to-consumer and e-commerce channel. Indeed, Dexcom is pursuing international growth and has extended its G6 CGM offering to additional markets, including the rollout in Belgium and Turkey in 4Q 2020. Commenting on the 2021 outlook, Lichtman noted that the company has maintained a conservative stance when it comes to its guidance in the past two years. The analyst assumes that the impact of competition from Abbott's Libre franchise is factored into the forecast. He believes that growth drivers for 2021 include “big new opportunities in T2 [Type 2 diabetes] and international expansion along with the G7 launch.” On the 3Q earnings call, Dexcom stated that it expects to launch G7 in several key markets in the second half of 2021, and then expand its reach into all of its core markets in 2022. Overall, Lichtman continues to be bullish on Dexcom and maintained a Buy rating with a $445 price target. Currently, Dexcom scores a Strong Buy analyst consensus based on 9 Buys and 2 Holds. The average price target stands at $456.11, indicating upside potential of 28.8% from current levels. Shares have already risen 53.5% over the past 52 weeks. Bottom line Abbott’s diversified business model and exposure to major growth areas like diabetes are its key strengths. Dexcom is completely focused on meeting the growing need for its CGM systems in the domestic as well as international markets. While the Street is bullish on both companies, right now, the average price target indicates a higher upside potential for Dexcom stock.

2020-12-16	2020-12-16 18:07:39	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Price Over Earnings Overview: Abbott Laboratories	Looking into the current session, Abbott Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: ABT) is trading at $106.71, after a 0.69% decrease. Over the past month, the stock decreased by 2.79%, but over the past year, it actually spiked by 22.16%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 7.32%. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.

Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 113.78 in the Health Care Equipment & Supplies industry, Abbott Laboratories Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 57.15. Shareholders might be inclined to think that the stock might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued. P/E ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance.

2020-10-27	2020-10-27 14:17:24	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Unusual Options Activity Insight: Abbott Laboratories	"On Tuesday, shares of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $108.88.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-30  * Strike Price: $110.00  * Volume: 612  * Open Interest: 1115Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * A Look Into Abbott's Debt  * Recap: Abbott Laboratories Q3 Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-23	2020-10-23 15:36:46	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	College Football Games Are Ad Hoc Covid-19 Testing Studies	"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- This weekend, after a two-month delay, the 14 football teams that make up the Big 10 athletic conference will start their season. Illinois will travel to Wisconsin for a Friday night game, and the rest of the conference will play on Saturday. The stands will be empty, but all seven games will be televised.The Big 10 had concluded over the summer that it was too risky to play sports during the pandemic, so it postponed all the fall sports, including football. On the West Coast, the Pac-12 conference came to the same conclusion for the same reason: “Our decision was guided by science,” the Pac-12 said in its news release.When the two leagues reversed their positions a month later, neither mentioned the most obvious reason for restarting football: the millions of dollars in TV money they would otherwise lose. Instead, they stressed they had found a way to protect the players from the virus and to “significantly improve our ability to prevent transmission of Covid,” as the Pac-12 put it in a press release.What the two conferences had discovered was rapid antigen tests that can detect the presence of Covid-19. They have both signed contracts with Quidel Corp., a midsize medical diagnostic company based in San Diego whose rapid antigen test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration.Unlike PRC tests, which are highly accurate but can take days to return results, antigen tests need only about 15 minutes. The Big 10 and the Pac-12 said they would give a Quidel test to every football player every day. The coaches and others who worked with the team would also be tested daily; it would amount to about 15,000 tests a week for each conference. In addition, all the athletes would receive a PCR test once a week  to double-check the accuracy of the rapid antigen tests.“This is a big breakthrough for us,” Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott told CNBC in early September. “It gives us near-immediate results. It will give us a high degree of confidence that … we are not promoting the spread of the virus.” Not only that, he added, but the data collected from the players would be used for research. “It is our hope that we are contributing to society’s return to work,” he said. “I think that is where this research could be very important.”Quidel’s chief executive officer, Douglas Bryant, was also on the show. “We are sincerely interested in a large asymptomatic study — the first of its kind,” he told CNBC. “We’re going to be involved in research that is going to allow us to see what asymptomatic testing looks like in a large population.”I had to wonder: Has anyone told the players they are test subjects?Quidel received FDA approval for its Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test in May. It was one of those emergency use authorizations that have become so common during the pandemic. The Quidel device had not gone through the clinical trial gauntlet necessary to gain full FDA approval, but the data it had collected was enough for the agency to allow it to be used during the pandemic.There was one catch: The FDA authorized the use of the Quidel test only on patients who were already showing symptoms of Covid-19. Yes, doctors could use it to test people with no symptoms, but there was not enough data on testing the asymptomatic to satisfy the government. As Dr. Susan Butler-Wu, an expert on diagnostic tests for infectious diseases, put it, using Quidel’s rapid antigen test on an asymptomatic population was an “off-label” use.The Trump administration has embraced rapid antigen tests for much the same reason as Larry Scott: If they work, the tests would allow, say, nursing home workers to zero in on infected residents much more quickly than they could with a PCR test. And those people could then be quarantined before the virus spread to the rest of the population.The federal government awarded a $760 million contract to Abbott Laboratories to distribute 150 million tests to schools and “other special needs populations.” Becton Dickinson received $24 million from the federal government to increase production of its rapid antigen test. Quidel received $71 million from the National Institutes of Health to expand its manufacturing capacity. The Trump administration even invoked the Defense Production Act to ensure that Becton Dickinson and Quidel prioritize deliveries of their antigen tests to nursing homes. In July, administration officials said they planned to distribute the tests to 14,000 long-term care facilities.Not everybody has been as quick to embrace rapid antigen tests as Larry Scott and the Trump administration. Although some public health officials were enthusiastic about the potential of the tests to slow the spread of the virus, others worried that they gave too many false readings.“It’s important always to use a diagnostic in the way that it has been designed to be used,” Elizabeth Talbot, New Hampshire’s deputy state epidemiologist, told Kaiser Health News. “We simply don’t know how [they] will perform in persons who are asymptomatic.”“I’ll be blunt,” Geoffrey Baird, the acting laboratory-medicine chair at the University of Washington, told The Atlantic. “Antigen testing will not and cannot work for asymptomatic screening and [it] will probably kill a lot of people.”Quidel says its rapid antigen test is 96.7% accurate. But in early August, Governor Mike DeWine of Ohio received a false positive using a Quidel test, according to Kaiser Health News. Then he took a PCR test and discovered he was negative.And in Nevada earlier this month, the state health department ordered that nursing homes, which were using both Quidel and Becton Dickinson rapid antigen tests, stop using them “until the accuracy of the tests can be better evaluated.” After surveying the nursing homes, the health department discovered that the rate of false positives was a staggering 60%. In the case of Quidel, of the nine positive results, eight were shown to be false after a subsequent PCR test. (Two days after Nevada issued its order, the federal government insisted that it resume the testing. Admiral Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary of Health and Human Services, declared Nevada’s action to be “unwise, uninformed and unlawful.” The state reversed course and allowed the tests to resume.)Which brings me back to football.When I spoke to the Pac-12 and Quidel, they quickly backed away from the notion that the athletes were going to be research subjects. “We are not going to be using athletes as guinea pigs,” said Kim Harmon, a doctor at the University of Washington who is also the research development director for the Pac-12. And despite what he had said on CNBC, Quidel’s Bryant insisted that the research that would take place would not be about gauging the accuracy of the tests on an asymptomatic population. (The Big 10 did not respond to my request to interview someone on its medical staff.)Harmon said that the company would not have access to the data the Pac-12 collects and that the universities would publish any results. Bryant ticked off a variety of prospective research possibilities, none of which had anything to do with comparing Quidel’s accuracy with the accuracy of a PCR test. He said the company was conducting a different study to gain full FDA approval of its rapid antigen tests for both symptomatic and asymptomatic populations.But given the controversy surrounding rapid antigen testing, the 2,600 or so football players who make up the Pac-12 and Big 10 rosters will most certainly be research subjects. Nobody yet knows how accurate the tests will be on an asymptomatic population — and giving daily tests to football players is a real-world crash trial, whether it’s a formal study or not.And what if they’re not accurate enough? What if there are a slew of false positives as there were in Nevada? Far worse, what if there are false negatives? Infected players would remain in contact with their teammates, spreading the virus until their infection is caught by the next day’s test — or a PCR test a week later.“There has been a suggestion in the media that daily antigen testing gives people a passport — they can go about their business,” Butler-Wu said. “But I don’t think it should work that way.” She mentioned a teenage girl who received a negative test despite being positive. Feeling safe, she went to a family event — and 14 out of the 15 people in attendance contracted Covid-19. “There is room for harm,” she said.And while false positives are less dangerous, they are problematic too, according to Butler-Wu, because they erode trust in the testing.For those of us who have long been critical of the way college sports is run, there is another troubling issue: The athletes really have no choice in the matter. Broadly speaking, their consent has not been sought. Even if it had been, the players are hardly in a position to say no; if they want to play football, they have to take the daily antigen tests. And it’s not even clear that the tests will provide the safety the Pac-12 and the Big 10 are promising. No matter what they say, using daily rapid antigen tests to make football possible is an experiment.Accurate or not, the tests are giving cover to the Big 10 and Pac-12 so that their teams can once again take the field and appear on television. And that’s what really matters, right?This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2020-10-21	2020-10-21 17:21:29	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Covid-19 Tests Are the Real Pandemic Moneymakers	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Vaccines and drugs get much of the attention in the scientific race to fight Covid-19. But companies have been working just as hard on ways to meet the enormous demand for testing. Those investments are beginning to pay off.Abbott Laboratories Inc. and ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., two major players in coronavirus testing, reported third-quarter results Wednesday that beat Wall Street estimates thanks largely to this focus. They followed Roche Holding AG, another leader in testing whose earnings last week showed a similar windfall. All three companies reported impressive growth as they ramped up machine production and rolled out new types of tests. Abbott’s $881 million in Covid-19 testing revenue accounted for nearly 10% of its total sales in the third quarter. ThermoFisher, which makes money by building testing machines and providing other services and supplies to labs, generated $2 billion in Covid-19 related revenue, up from $1.3 billion last quarter. Revenue at Roche's molecular diagnostics business, which includes much of its coronavirus testing operations, more than doubled in the third quarter compared with the same period last year. Abbott expects even greater Covid-related sales in the fourth quarter, in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, and expects demand to remain strong at least through 2021. Those are big projections, but they aren’t unreasonable.Coronavirus cases in Europe and the U.S. are surging, and stemming the tide will take time. But even when the infection rate slows, demand will remain for testing. The renewed outbreaks highlight the need for a better approach to sustainably containing the virus, and broad surveillance testing offers a way forward that's comparatively easy on the economy. Catching cases early should reduce spread, and people will be more confident engaging in increased activities if testing is speedy and routine. Abbott and Roche have recently launched new rapid tests that deliver results in 15 minutes or less without lab analysis or specialized instruments. Those new tests should be well-suited to both acute outbreaks and reopening efforts as they allow for easy and inexpensive repeat testing. There's a lot of room for improvement: Many European countries did not take advantage of a relatively virus-free summer to build enough testing and tracing capacity. The U.S., too, is well short of the testing volumes needed to contain the virus.While testing could peak in the next few quarters, the pandemic is likely to have a long tail. Only a widely available vaccine is likely to damp demand meaningfully, and even then it won’t erase the need for testing. It’s possible that one of the front-runners in vaccine development will gain emergency authorization by late November, but that's a best-case scenario. Relatively few doses will be available at first as drugmakers ramp up manufacturing, and distribution will take time. Vaccines likely won’t be broadly available to the general public until a fair bit of 2021 has passed, and it will be even longer before most receive it.The hard truth is that it will be a while before the virus is well-controlled, vaccine or not. In the meantime, testing is a good business to be in. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

Hard to tell, but Abbott Laboratories  has been central to the expansion of testing for Covid-19 since testing became important.  For the quarter reported, Abbott Labs reported adjusted earnings of $0.98 per share, beating consensus estimates by $0.07 (FYI, GAAP EPS also beat Wall Street estimates by $0.07.).  Yes, these numbers are positive surprises, but what really makes them stand out is that this not only returns both earnings and sales to growth after a tough second quarter, they also return earnings to double-digit growth (which had been the trend), and revenue generation to something well above what had been the prior trend.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/dbd9d432-6a9f-3f89-bf6a-d6521fd53d34/does-abbott-labs-still-pass.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-21	2020-10-21 11:52:32	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	A Look Into Abbott's Debt	Shares of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) rose by 8.51% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Abbott Laboratories has.Abbott Laboratories's Debt According to the Abbott Laboratories's most recent balance sheet as reported on July 29, 2020, total debt is at $19.68 billion, with $18.18 billion in long-term debt and $1.50 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $4.76 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $14.92 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Abbott Laboratories's $68.78 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.29. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2020-10-20	2020-10-20 14:16:38	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott Laboratories's Earnings Outlook	Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) announces its next round of earnings this Wednesday, October 21. Here is Benzinga's look at Abbott Laboratories's Q3 earnings report.What Are Earnings, Net Income And Earnings Per Share (EPS)? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.Earnings And Revenue Abbott Laboratories EPS is expected to be around $0.9, according to sell-side analysts. Sales will likely be near $8.51 billion. Abbott Laboratories earnings in the same period a year ago was $0.84 per share. Quarterly sales came in at $8.08 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a given company yields the &quot;consensus estimates.&quot; If the company posts earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate, the stock may move by a considerable margin.View more earnings on ABTIf the company were to report earnings in line when it publishes results Wednesday, quarterly profit would be up 7.14%. Revenue would be up 5.37% on a year-over-year basis. The company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this:Quarter Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2019  EPS Estimate 0.41 0.58 0.95 0.84  EPS Actual 0.57 0.65 0.95 0.84  Revenue Estimate 6.75 B 7.34 B 8.26 B 8.11 B  Revenue Actual 7.33 B 7.73 B 8.31 B 8.08 B  Stock Performance Shares of Abbott Laboratories were trading at $108.11 as of October 19.

2020-09-18	2020-09-18 13:26:13	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Is Sorrento Stock Really Worth the Speculation?	Until this year, Sorrento Therapetics (NASDAQ:SRNE) was an obscure biotech operator. But this changed with the emergence with the novel coronavirus. Now SRNE stock has become one of the most controversial, and volatile, biotech stocks in the market.Source: Shutterstock From May until early August, Sorrento shares spiked from $2.60 to $19. But since then, there has been a flood of selling. Currently, Sorrento's stock price is at $9,48. Yet the market capitalization is still a hefty $2.42 billion.Keep in mind that Sorrento did not come public the typical way. Instead, the company pulled off a reverse merger with a corporate shell -- called QuickByte -- in September 2009. But like many of these types of deals, the stock price just isn't sustainable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsConsider that reverse mergers typically do not have capital raises. There is also the issue of its lack of coverage on Wall Street. Further, when it comes to biotech companies, it can take a considerable amount of time for FDA approval, which many biotech stocks rely on for performance. SRNE Stock Latest DevelopmentsSorrento was originally focused on oncology treatments, which is certainly a complicated area of medicine. But the company has - at an astonishing pace - transformed itself into a Covid-19 fighter.  * 7 Best-Performing Stocks to Buy In 4 ProShares ETFs So let's take a look at the main candidates in the pipeline:  * COVI-GUARD (STI-1499): This is a therapeutic for Covid-19, which uses a neutralizing antibody to help decrease the risks of infection. Sorrento has recently begun the process to a Phase 1 trial.  * Abivertinib: In May, Sorrento was granted an exclusive license to this from ACEA Therapeutics (the coverage is for all territories outside China). Abivertinib, which is in a Phase 2 trial, is targeted at those who suffer from pulmonary symptoms.  * T-VIVA-19: This is a protein vaccine for Covid-19 that neutralizes antibodies and T-cell responses. This candidate is still in the preclinical stage.  Note that other pharma operators -- like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) -- have candidates in Phase 3 trials.  * COVI-TRACK: This is an in vitro diagnostic test kit for Covid-19.So yes, the company has definitely been busy! But of these candidates, the one that is likely to have the most impact in the short-term is COVI-TRACK.While there are various other diagnostic tests - such as from Abbott (NYSE:ABT) - Sorrento's does have some advantages. The kit is quick, which can get results in about eight minutes, and is based on a person's saliva. In fact, such a test could be a game-changer and be essential for many companies to better operate.And even if a vaccine is approved soon, there will still be much demand for ongoing testing. Bottom Line on SorrentoLike any early-stage biotech company, there are notable risks with Sorrento. Let's face it, when it comes to experimental medical advances, there are no guaranteesBut Sorrento has also suffered from some unforced errors. For example, the CFO was recently terminated -- and there was no reason provided. Such a move is often jarring for investors.The CEO, Henry Ji, has also threatened legal action against short seller Hindenburg Research. But why waste time on such a thing? Especially when Sorrento is in a race to create innovative treatments? I'm not really sure.And, of course, Ji has also stated, &quot;We want to emphasize there is a cure. There is a solution that works 100 percent. If we have the neutralizing antibody in your body, you don't need the social distancing. You can open up a society without fear.&quot;In the world of biotech, such bold statements are pretty rare! They are also something that can be a red flag for investors.Yet despite all this, when looking at the pipeline of Sorrento, there does look like there is potential here. There is a good possibility for the diagnostic test to get approval and this could be a growth driver for SRNE. Although, for investors considering SRNE stock, the best approach is to use that part of the portfolio reserved for speculative investments.On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is an advisor/board member for startups and author of various books and online courses about technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, The Robotic Process Automation Handbook and Learn Python Super Fast.

2020-09-18	2020-09-18 09:31:13	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	20/20 GeneSystems Stock: Leveraging AI for More Accurate Cancer Screening	20/20 GeneSystems is the developer of diagnostic testing tools for cancer and other diseases. Keep in mind that this startup leverages AI (artificial intelligence) for its systems. Oh, and you can also invest in 20/20 GeneSystems stock through an equity crowdfunding campaign on SeedInvest.Source: Shutterstock The founder and CEO is Jonathan Cohen. During his career, the former patent attorney he has raised more than $15 million in equity capital for a variety of ventures. He has also been able to strike sales and marketing agreements with Fortune 500 companies like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) and Ping An (the largest health insurance company in China). Key Global PartnershipsAccording to the investment materials from 20/20 GeneSystems, the company believes it is the only one to launch a multi-cancer screening test that is based on AI. The result is that a patient can get early detection, which greatly increases survivability. For example, according to a wide-ranging study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the survival rate for lung cancer was over 90% when there was early detection.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNote that 20/20 GeneSystems has its own CLIA-certified laboratory for the U.S. market. There are also partnerships in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.OK then, here are the diagnostics that the company offers:  * OneTest: This is targeted for six common types of cancers, including as for lung, colon, kidney, and ovarian. The marketing of this test started last year  * PAULA's Test: This is a diagnostic for those who have a high-risk of lung cancer due to long-term smoking.  * BioCheck Suspicious Powder Screening Kit: This is a low-cost test to detect whether a powder contains biological material that could cause problems with screening. Note that BioCheck is generally used by early responders.So what about anything for the novel coronavirus? Well, the company does have something. And yes, this should be a driver for 20/20 GeneSystems stock.  * 20 Election Stocks to Buy if Joe Biden Wins in 2020 The company's diagnostic is called CoronaCheck, which was developed by Roche Diagnostics. It tests for two types of antibodies of the virus. So far, 20/20 GeneSystems has sold over $1.2 million of the CoronaCheck tests. The company also has plans to enhance the diagnostic by using a lateral flow stripe to enhance the effectiveness of the AI. Bottom Line on 20/20 GeneSystems StockBefore the crowdfunding round, the company was able to raise about $5.5 million. Consider that one of the investors was Ping An, which invested $2 million. This could mean a big opportunity for distribution of 20/20 GeneSystems' diagnostics. Ping An has about 300 million subscribers to its mobile app.As for the crowdfunding investment, this has been tracking nicely. So far, the company has raised over $2.4 million and there are more than 800 investors. The valuation has been set at $38.5 million.The minimum investment is $502 per share and the equity is in the form of preferred stock (this means that investors will get first dibs on the money invested if there is a liquidity event, such as an acquisition). There are also various perks, which are based on the amount committed. For example, if you invest between $1,500 and $4,999, you will get one free OneTest for cancer and a COVID1-19 antibody test.Despite the success, 20/20 GeneSystems certainly has notable risks. After all, this is the case with any private investing deal. For example, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has not been able to pull together its financials for 2019. Next, the market for diagnostics is intensely competitive and there are large companies in the space that can devote substantial resources to new approaches. Keep in mind that 20/20 GeneSystems has only 18 employees.In other words, before making an investment in 20/20 GeneSystems stock, its advisable to do your own analysis.On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is an advisor/board member for startups and author of various books and online courses about technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, The Robotic Process Automation Handbook and Learn Python Super Fast.

2020-09-16	2020-09-16 00:00:00	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	The Argus Dividend Growth Portfolio	Often overlooked amid the market's gyrations, dividend income is an important element of total return. Consider recent results: in 2015, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 1.4%, including dividends -- but excluding dividends, the market was down 0.7%. Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors. And dividend payments softened the blow in 2018, when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks, particularly in a slow-growth or recessionary economic environment.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ee2cb308-3324-39c8-b0ae-47798c9d8c19/the-argus-dividend-growth.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-02	2020-09-02 23:03:23	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbot Labs: New COVID-19 Antibody Test Is a Game Changer, Says Analyst	While many small pharma companies are racing to bring various coronavirus-related solutions to market, it is one of Big Pharma’s representatives that has flexed its muscles with the latest meaningful product. Last week, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) announced it had been granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA for its rapid COVID-19 antibody test, BinaxNOW.The test doesn’t need any instrumentation or equipment, and each test kit is completely disposable. The test provides results in 15 minutes, is priced at $5 and can be overseen by a wide range of people. Despite being a quick solution, it is highly accurate, with 97.1% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity rates.The U.S. government was quick off the mark and has already gobbled up almost all of ABT’s 2020 BinaxNOW capacity, equating to 150 million units (i.e. $750 million in sales).As a result of the test’s EUA, Credit Suisse analyst Matt Miksic increased his estimate for the Rapid Test by $5.2 billion. However, Miksic expects the “debate over the sustainability of Covid testing sales to continue.”The 5-star analyst said, “While there is little debate among investors over the magnitude of near-term sales these new COVID-19 tests will generate, the question as to how long these sales will continue, or how much share ABT will ultimately capture remains actively contested. Our view remains that lateral flow tests, which can be performed without instruments or equipment, by wide range of individuals, will be an important and widely used tool for mitigating the risk of spreading the virus while reopening businesses and schools. While serology (i.e. antibody) tests have seen only limited utility and demand to date, we expect demand for immunity testing to increase as vaccines are approved, distributed and administered.”Accordingly, Miksic raised his price target for ABT shares from $109 to $136. The implication for investors? Upside potential of 24%. Miksic’s Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating stays as is. (To watch Miksic’s track record, click here)Overall, based on 10 Buy ratings, 2 Holds and 1 Sell, Abbot has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $116.90, the average price target implies upside of ~7% could be in the cards.

The airline-led talks come as Air Canada and WestJet introduce their own testing plans for Toronto and Vancouver airports, respectively this fall.

2020-08-31	2020-08-31 15:21:33	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott Analyst: Expert View On Rapid Coronavirus Antigen Test 'Clearly Bullish'	Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) shares rallied Thursday after the company's rapid COVID-19 test received emergency use authorization from the FDA.   The Abbott Analyst:  Bob Hopkins reiterated a Buy rating on Abbott Laboratories and increased the price target from $110 to $122.The Abbott Thesis: BofA Securities held a call with a virology and microbiology expert regarding Abbott's test, Hopkins said in a Monday note. (See his track record here.)The expert's view on Abbott's COVID-19 test was &quot;clearly bullish,&quot; the analyst said; BofA did not name the expert in the note. Until real world data becomes available likely later this year, questions regarding accuracy in asymptomatic patients will remain unanswered, Hopkins said. Even if the sensitivity of the test falls to the mid-70s, the value could still be very high given Abbott's ability to mass produce at a low cost, and the ease of use advantages that come with the lateral flow test, the analyst said. Abbott plans to initiate studies on asymptomatic patients, he said. Abbott's new test is unlikely to negatively impact the PCR testing market, but if the accuracy is sustained, it could reduce the market for other antigen tests, Hopkins said. How the competitive dynamics will play out depends on where the U.S. government -- which has bought all of Abbott's initial capacity -- plans on distributing the first batch, the analyst said, citing the expert.BofA attributed its upwardly revised price target not only due to the testing momentum but also to outstanding performance of Libre 2 glucose test; a favorable currency impact for the year; a nutrition business that's getting back to normal; and an improvement in surgical procedures.ABT Price Action: Abbott shares were down 0.11% at $110.57 at last check Monday.

2020-08-30	2020-08-30 07:24:53	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott Expanding Its Covid-19 Test To Asymptomatic People- Report	Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is now holding trials to try and expand its rapid Covid-19 test to people who show no symptoms of the virus, ABT’s CEO Robert Ford has revealed to CNBC.“We are working on developing data for asymptomatic claims, so we are running our clinical trial, and we’ll eventually have data to be able to support that,” Ford told CNBC.“In the meantime, we see it being able to be deployed, because it doesn’t requirement an instrument … through the federal government, through the state governments, through schools, through employers, or even through retail clinics,” the CEO continued. “We think that’s a great opportunity to be able to line up this volume.”The Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card has just received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), does not require instrumentation, and can deliver Covid-19 test results in 15 minutes or less.It uses nasal swabs and is simple to use, inexpensive, and can be easily employed by medical personnel or trained operators in certain non-clinical environments operating through a CLIA certificate.However, as it currently stands, the test is only approved for individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider within the first seven days of symptom onset.Earlier this week the US government awarded a $760 million contract to Abbott for the delivery of 150 million rapid BinaxNOW Point of Care (POC) Covid-19 tests.“The introduction of Abbott’s antigen test is another incredibly valuable result of President Trump’s all-of-America approach to constructing our world-leading COVID-19 testing capacity,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar.“By strategically distributing 150 million of these tests to where they’re needed most, we can track the virus like never before and protect millions of Americans at risk in especially vulnerable situations.”Abbott says it has the capability to scale up to meet the demand for antigen testing across the country and is the only known source that can immediately provide the required items to meet HHS’s urgent needs. (See Abbott stock analysis on TipRanks)“Early data for ABT’s test demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 97.1%/98.5% when used within the first seven days of symptom onset. Abbott plans to ship “tens of millions” of tests in September and expects to ramp to 50M tests/month by the beginning of October” commented Canaccord Genuity’s Max Masucci on the news.Shares in ABT are now trading up 27% year-to-date, with an 8% spike over the last five days following the FDA approval. The stock has a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy Street consensus with 10 recent buy ratings, 2 holds and 1 sell.

2020-08-28	2020-08-28 09:16:04	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	XpresSpa Group’s Stock Drop Ignores the Potential of Pivot to Virus Testing	XpresSpa Group (NASDAQ:XSPA) announced a $35.3 million direct offering Aug. 25 that gave investors one share of XSPA stock and short-term warrants to purchase another at $3.05.Source: Maridav / Shutterstock The news sent the share price for the provider of Covid-19 screening and testing services at JFK International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport down 20% at the Aug. 26 market open. It's now lower than it's been since the beginning of June. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast month, I predicted that if the company's pilot program to provide screening and testing to JFK employees was successful, XSPA would surely revisit $7. Down below $3 on the offering, nothing's changed, in my opinion, to alter my view.At less than $3, XSPA stock is a screaming speculative buy. Here's why. XSPA Stock Offering is DilutiveThe company reported second-quarter earnings on Aug. 19. As of Aug. 14, 56.78 million shares were outstanding. Add in 22.44 million shares for the direct offering (assumes the exercise of warrants within 24 months), and you get 79.22 million shares outstanding. According to Morningstar, XpresSpa has an enterprise value of $164.2 million. Add in the $35.3 million in cash, $14.6 million in total debt, and a current share price as I write this of $2.72, and you get a revised enterprise value of $194.8 million.So, on a per-share basis, the company's enterprise value falls by 15%. On the surface, that would be bad as it means a buyer of the entire company would theoretically have to pay 15% less to buy XpresSpa.   * 9 Gold Stocks to Buy That Still Have Room to Run However, in the big picture, XpresSpa is now worth $30.6 million more than it was before the announcement. If it can take the proceeds of the direct offering and turn it into revenue, the odds of its share price falling too much further diminish significantly. While your one share of stock now owns slightly less than it did before the announcement, in six months that won't matter if XpresSpa continues to make inroads with its Covid-19 testing.  How's It Doing So Far?XpresSpa plans to use the proceeds of the direct offering for future locations, working capital, and general corporate purposes. The company made the offering because it needs the money to move beyond the two Covid-19 XpresCheck testing facilities (JFK, Newark) that it's opened in 2020. JFK opened in June while Newark opened Aug. 17.In its Q2 2020 press release, the company pointed out there are approximately 30 major U.S. airports. These airports employ an average of 30,000 people. They're considered &quot;Large Hubs.&quot; There are an additional 30 airports that are considered &quot;Medium Hubs.&quot; They average 15,000 staff.XpresSpa has existing facilities at 19 of the large-hub airports and four of the medium-hubs. At present, it only has XpresCheck locations at two of the large hubs. It is in active discussions with most of these airports. The potential near-term and medium-term opportunities are significant. The JFK facility can do up to 500 tests a day while Newark can do 350. However, on Aug. 24, XpresSpa announced that it had signed a contract with Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) to secure 100 ID NOW testing instruments. These instruments reduce the waiting time for results from 48 hours or more to less than 15 minutes.  &quot;Securing the use of the Abbott devices is part of XpresCheck's strategy to deliver transformative testing and healthcare services to airports across the country. This first mover advantage in the airport space will roll out in September at its flagship locations in JFK International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport,&quot; the company's press release stated. In any long-term return to regular business and personal air travel, a 15-minute test makes it far safer for airport employees and travelers. Sure, a whole bunch could go wrong, but even if a vaccine is created, testing is still going to remain an excellent way to reduce the possible transmission of Covid-19.XpresSpa seems to be doing all that it can to ensure airports are safe, and yet there remain people who want to see them fail. My question is, why? Spend Money to Make MoneyDo you know the saying, &quot;You have to spend money to make money?&quot; Well, I believe this applies to XpresSpa.To pivot from spa treatments -- on hold since March and not likely to resume operations until the fourth quarter or later -- to Covid-19 takes a big step up in capital requirements. Given it's generating very little cash flow, traditional financing would be difficult to obtain. A share offering at attractive terms was the only way. Under this scenario, for CEO Doug Satzman and the rest of the board to not pull the trigger on a direct offering, would, in my opinion, be a breach of their fiduciary duty. To let the company die rather than dilute the shareholders would have been irresponsible and reckless. Should you buy on the dip? As I wrote in July, it's a speculative buy. It was trading around $3.50. Down 22% since the latest news about a 15-minute test combined with $35 million in cash provides investors with an even better risk to reward ratio.Buy away.

2020-08-28	2020-08-28 05:53:27	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott Scores $760M US Gov Deal For Rapid Covid-19 Saliva Test	The US government has awarded a $760 million contract to Abbott Laboratories (ABT) for the delivery of 150 million rapid BinaxNOW Point of Care (POC) Covid-19 tests.Testing will be potentially deployed to schools and to assist with serving other special needs populations, says the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of and Defense (DOD).“The introduction of Abbott’s antigen test is another incredibly valuable result of President Trump’s all-of-America approach to constructing our world-leading COVID-19 testing capacity,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar.“By strategically distributing 150 million of these tests to where they’re needed most, we can track the virus like never before and protect millions of Americans at risk in especially vulnerable situations.”The Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card has just received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), does not require instrumentation, and will deliver Covid-19 test results in 15 minutes or less.It uses nasal swabs and is simple to use, inexpensive, and can be easily employed by medical personnel or trained operators in certain non-clinical environments operating through a CLIA certificate.Abbott says it has the capability to scale up to meet the demand for antigen testing across the country and is the only known source that can immediately provide the required items to meet HHS’s urgent needs. (See Abbott stock analysis on TipRanks)“Early data for ABT’s test demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 97.1%/98.5% when used within the first seven days of symptom onset. Abbott plans to ship “tens of millions” of tests in September and expects to ramp to 50M tests/month by the beginning of October” commented Canaccord Genuity’s Max Masucci on the news.Shares in ABT are now trading up 28% year-to-date, with a 10% spike over the last five days following the FDA approval. The stock has a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy Street consensus with 10 recent buy ratings, 2 holds and 1 sell. Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $110 now suggests shares could pull back from current levels.Related News:  Moderna Pops 6% On Covid-19 Vaccine Response In Older Adults; Analyst Says Buy Now  AstraZeneca Rises On Report Trump Could Fast-Track Covid-19 Vaccine Candidate  Abbott Jumps 22% On Emergency Use Nod For Credit Card Size Covid-19 Test More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Okta Sinks Despite Earnings Beat With Stock Up 89% YTD   * Nutanix Spikes 17% On Earnings Beat; Analyst Downgrades To Hold   * Workday Spikes 12% In After-Hours On 2Q Beat   * Ulta Soars 14% As Top-Line Recovery Starts To Take Shape	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbott-scores-760m-us-gov-055327935.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-27	2020-08-27 23:29:47	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	U.S. Buys Almost All Abbott’s $5 Rapid Tests Made This Year	(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government is buying almost all of the $5 Covid tests Abbott Laboratories plans to produce this year, purchasing 150 million of the tests that were cleared yesterday and can be run in just 15 minutes.Under the agreement, the government will pay $750 million for 150 million tests, according to people familiar with the deal. The company was granted an emergency authorization on Wednesday, and public health officials quickly agreed the new test -- which works without relying on laboratory equipment -- could help ease delays that have crimped much of the nation’s testing capacity.The Trump administration has been criticized for failing to institute a coordinated testing approach in the U.S., and for a recent change in guidelines that curbs the testing of people without symptoms. Now, it plans to purchase almost all of the coming supply of a breakthrough product that can be used broadly, and promises to deliver results on a mass scale no matter where it’s given.Unlike other tests, Abbott’s BinaxNOW is entirely self-contained and doesn’t need other equipment to get results, meaning large numbers of tests can be done simultaneously. It’s a single-use test about the size of a credit card, with results given at the point of care.Abbott has said it will produce 50 million a month starting in October and plans to sell them widely for $5 each. It expects to have “tens of millions” for September, said Andrea Wainer, executive vice president of the Rapid & Molecular Diagnostics unit. Abbott spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the technology, infrastructure and manufacturing for BinaxNOW and its other tests, self-funding the innovation, the company said in a statement.Shares climbed 7.9% Thursday to $111.29 at the close of New York trading.“This is a major development that will help our country to remain open, get Americans back to work, and kids back to school,” said Alyssa Farah, the White House communications director. “The Trump administration is proud to partner with Abbott labs to make this purchase possible to help the American people.”It’s not entirely clear who will receive the initial round of tests. An administration official said they will go first to nursing homes, schools and other high-risk populations, but details were scant. Demand is expected to be high, as they could help guarantee the safety of everything from flights to restaurants to offices.Public health officials at the state level are already trying to get access.Jared Moskowitz, director of Florida’s division of emergency management, said on Twitter he is “aggressively” pursuing the test, which he called a game changer.The test uses so-called lateral flow technology, similar to the method used in at-home pregnancy tests. It can be administered by a range of health-care workers, including pharmacists or even school nurses, in almost any location.The provider swirls a collection swab through both nostrils, then inserts it into the BinaxNOW card and adds a few drops of a liquid chemical known as an extraction buffer. The card is closed and the liquid sample flows along the surface of a pad that has reactive molecules embedded, which gives a result in 15 minutes.While a pregnancy test detects a hormone, BinaxNOW looks for an antigen, a tiny portion of the coronavirus protein.Antigen ControversyIt’s not the first round of controversy over fast-acting antigen tests. Several other companies, including Quidel Corp. and Becton Dickinson & Co., also have received authorization for similar diagnostics, though they require small pieces of equipment to analyze the results.The federal government is also buying large numbers of those devices to send to nursing homes as part of its efforts to get the virus under control in high-risk areas.The result has been conflict between the U.S. government and other groups seeking to enhance their testing.Tommy Thompson, the interim president of the University of Wisconsin System and former Secretary of Health and Human Services under George W. Bush, said he had to fight to get 36 of the Quidel machines that it ordered to help it open campuses across the state after the federal government stepped in.With the latest tests, Thompson said he understood why the administration was cutting to the front of the line.“Everybody is looking for a faster, cheaper, better test,” he said in an interview. “The federal government is going to take a big chunk of it, and they should. But we want as many as we possibly can get,” he said. “We are already in line with Abbott, and hopefully we’ll get some of this test as well.”Soaring DemandIndustry watchers expect soaring demand for the technology that could help Americans get out of their houses more often and more safely.Demand for an antigen test “could be ENORMOUS -– think about employers, restaurants, games/events, transportation etc. using these tests for ensuring safety,” Vijay Kumar, an analyst at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients.The test could help people return to a sense of normalcy while helping generate $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion a year in revenue for all Covid-19 products at Abbott, said Robbie Marcus, an analyst at JPMorgan, in a note.Abbott Chief Executive Officer Robert Ford acknowledged the expected demand in an op-ed published today by CNBC. The product is transformative because it can be made in large numbers, “which is what the country needs more than anything today,” he said.Abbott is also launching a mobile app called Navica that will be connected to the test, giving users an electronic record of their coronavirus status. The results could be used much like a boarding pass to allow those who are negative to return to everyday activities.Required to ReportThose with a positive result will be told to quarantine and contact their doctor. Health-care workers who conduct the tests are required to report positive results to public health officials.The U.S. is currently running about 800,000 tests a day nationwide, or 24 million a month, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Abbott built two new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. to produce BinaxNOW, allowing it to more than double the number of tests available to 50 million a month.“Our nation’s frontline health-care workers and clinical laboratory personnel have been under siege since the onset of this pandemic,” said Charles Chiu, a professor of Laboratory Medicine at University of California, San Francisco. “The availability of rapid testing for Covid-19 will help support overburdened laboratories, accelerate turnaround times and greatly expand access to people who need it.”Who exactly those people are has yet to be determined.(Adds Abbott comment in the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbott-shares-surge-fda-clearing-125549302.html?.tsrc=rss

The country is now seeing about 33 cases per 100,000 people compared to three in June, ministry adviser Philip Nolan told reporters in Dublin, while the number of people being admitted to the hospital is starting to rise.The warnings come a day after health minister Stephen Donnelly said the country is at a tipping point that could result in another nationwide lockdown. Ireland reported 93 new cases with no deaths Thursday. There have been 1,535 cases over the past two weeks.Arizona Cases Steady as Deaths Drop (1:16 p.m. NY)Arizona on Thursday reported 680 new virus cases, a 0.3% increase to 200,139 that matched the prior seven-day average as the state appeared to continue its progress in controlling Covid-19.

The number of cases includes students and faculty, and students will not be sent home during that period, he said. After two weeks, the state will reassess, Cuomo said.The edict comes as the number of coronavirus cases in the state remains low. Of the more than 83,000 people tested on Aug. 26, 0.95% were positive for the virus, according to the most recent state data. There were 490 hospitalizations and four virus-related fatalities.There have been several virus clusters in Western New York, Cuomo said.

2020-08-27	2020-08-27 21:00:51	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	New CDC Covid Testing Guidelines Have It Backward	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- At least so far, the two most glaring failures of the U.S. response to the pandemic are in testing and public communication. Both came together this week when the CDC changed its testing guidelines in a way that had public health scientists baffled.The new guidelines say people who don’t have symptoms of Covid-19 don’t need to be tested — even if they think they were exposed. “CDC is driving us all crazy,” says Barry Bloom, a professor of public health at Harvard. “This just makes absolutely no sense.”You don’t have to be a scientist to see this as bizarre, after mass fear of asymptomatic spread caused millions to be shut up in our homes last spring, and remains the impetus behind mask mandates and other restrictions that treat all of us as potentially contagious no matter how healthy we feel.The change also comes at a time when the technology exists to start scaling up Covid-19 tests  that are cheap, painless and quick. Massive-scale, regular testing was the way many experts envisioned a return to normal life after all the lockdowns. That way, the small fraction of people who actually have an active infection could be quarantined, and the rest could live with much more confidence and freedom in the long months it could take to achieve widespread immunity through a vaccine. While the public has been blamed for being too impatient to stay locked down longer, the real blame lies with those who didn’t use the time we bought them to prepare a testing strategy and communicate it clearly.Take the new CDC guidelines. “If you look at what they say, there are a bunch of weird contradictory guidelines,” says Harvard epidemiology professor William Hanage. The CDC is saying they don’t advise you to get a test, but you might be advised to get a test. It’s left up to individuals to decide, he says.Worse still, the test technology we’ve employed is the wrong one to stem the infections. The technique, known as PCR, is accurate but takes too long to get results — a few days at best and several weeks at worst.By then, the results might be almost worthless for identifying clusters or contacts early enough to prevent future outbreaks. Those who are positive have already spread the disease to most of the people they were likely to give it to. “It’s all about speed and speed is one thing we don’t spend enough time talking about,” says Hanage.Even with the wait, though, experts say you should get tested if you were exposed to a known or suspected case — whether or not you feel feel sick. And ideally, people who work in healthcare, nursing homes and prisons should be able to get routine testing.Speeding up the process would undoubtedly make all of this much more helpful. And a number of existing tests can deliver results in minutes. They don’t have to be sent to central labs to be processed but work more like home pregnancy tests. If those could become widely available, then many more people could be tested routinely, and even those without high-risk jobs could take an instant test before going to a restaurant or visiting friends and relatives.Bloom says the advent of do-it-yourself testing will give the public a much-needed sense of control. Quicker test results can also help scientists understand how the disease is spreading. In Japan, Iceland and other countries with a more coherent testing strategy, contact tracing goes backwards as well as forwards. That is, if a person tests positive, public health workers would find out not just who they might have passed the disease to, but where they might have gotten it, and who else got it from the same source.This is particularly likely to help contain Covid-19, says Hanage, because many cases don’t transmit to anyone, but a few give it to many in so-called superspreading events. A recently released study he co-authored used genetic fingerprinting of the virus to examine the outbreak that happened at a meeting of Biogen executives in Boston in late February. They found evidence that this superspreading event seeded about a third of all cases seen across the state, including several hundred in a homeless shelter.Many of these cases could have been avoided had the outbreak been identified earlier. In Japan, he says, by working fast, a so-called cluster-busting approach has helped keep the disease levels low.The big hurdle to getting faster testing is FDA approval. A number of small biotechnology companies have been given NIH grants to develop and scale up such tests, but some are not quite as accurate as the standard PCR test.Or at least that’s the perception. PCR tests will give a positive result if people still carry traces of the genetic material of the virus long after infection, even if they are no longer capable of transmitting the virus to others. The quicker tests might be just as good at detecting people who are capable of seeding new clusters of disease — people who are carrying active virus rather than just remnants or fragments.But FDA rules won’t allow approval of any test that’s less sensitive than the current standard, even if, in a practical sense, it’s a vast improvement. Those rules can be important for keeping bad drugs and diagnostics off the market, but in this case the criteria could be expanded as to what constitutes a superior test. With U.S. deaths crossing 180,000, a faster, less-accurate test might be just as valuable as a slower, more-accurate one. (One 15-minute test did demonstrate enough accuracy to be granted approval for emergency use – a $5 test kit developed by Abbott Laboratories. The U.S. government bought up most of the supply for $750 million.)It’s becoming clear that there will be no single savior, but we’ll make progress against the pandemic through a combination of vaccines, better treatment, better understanding of how the disease spreads. Faster testing, though, has the potential to make the most dramatic improvement in the shortest time. The CDC should be doing all it can to encourage more and faster testing — not standing in the way.(Updates emergency use authorization of faster Covid tests in the 15th paragraph. )This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Faye Flam is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Hologic Inc. and Quest Diagnostics Inc. sank as much as 12%, while other diagnostic companies like Becton Dickinson and Co., PerkinElmer Inc., Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. fell at least 5%.Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar wrote that demand for Abbott’s new antigen test “could be ENORMOUS” but he doesn’t expect supply to keep up, which should help other test makers.William Blair analyst Brian Weinstein called the news a “massive announcement that should be meaningful to Abbott’s financial outlook.” At the same time, the “desperate need for testing” across the country means no one single test is going to be in place everywhere. He expects any incremental pricing pressure from Abbott’s $5 test will be offset by stronger-than-expected demand.“Abbott’s EUA does nothing to change our enthusiasm around the opportunities for these other companies,” Weinstein wrote.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbott-5-rapid-covid-test-151105358.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-27	2020-08-27 13:48:08	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Looking Into Abbott Laboratories's Return On Capital Employed	Looking at Q2, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) earned $672.00 million, a 11.35% increase from the preceding quarter. Abbott Laboratories's sales decreased to $7.33 billion, a 5.15% change since Q1. In Q1, Abbott Laboratories earned $758.00 million, and total sales reached $7.73 billion.Why ROCE Is Significant Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Abbott Laboratories's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. In Q2, Abbott Laboratories posted an ROCE of 0.02%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on ABTROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Abbott Laboratories is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For Abbott Laboratories, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q2 Earnings Recap Abbott Laboratories reported Q2 earnings per share at $0.57/share, which beat analyst predictions of $0.41/share.See more from Benzinga  * How Does Abbott Laboratories's Debt Look?  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-27	2020-08-27 12:08:25	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	How Does Abbott Laboratories's Debt Look?	Shares of Abbott Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: ABT) rose by 22.54% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Abbott Laboratories has.Abbott Laboratories's Debt According to the Abbott Laboratories's most recent financial statement as reported on July 29, 2020, total debt is at $19.68 billion, with $18.18 billion in long-term debt and $1.50 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $4.76 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $14.92 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Abbott Laboratories's $68.78 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.29. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Importance of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-27	2020-08-27 07:55:54	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott Jumps 22% On Emergency Use Nod For Credit Card Size Covid-19 Test	Abbott Laboratories spiked 22% in Wednesday’s extended market session after announcing that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for its BinaxNOW COVID-19 rapid test for the detection of COVID-19 infection.Abbott (ABT) said that the portable test, which has the size of a credit card, provides results in 15 minutes. The test, which will be sold for $5, demonstrated sensitivity of 97.1% and specificity of 98.5% in a clinical study. The company plans to ship tens of millions of tests in September, ramping up to 50 million tests a month at the beginning of October.Abbott said that the BinaxNOW test uses its lateral flow technology, making it a reliable and familiar format for frequent mass testing. With no equipment required, the device will be an important tool to manage risk by identifying infectious people so they don't spread the disease to others, the company said.In addition, Abbott will launch a complementary mobile app for iPhone and Android devices named NAVICA. This free first-of-its-kind app, will allow people who test negative to display a temporary digital health pass that is renewed each time a person is tested through their healthcare provider together with the date of the test result. Organizations will be able to view and verify the information on a mobile device to facilitate entry into facilities along with hand-washing, social distancing, enhanced cleaning and mask-wearing.“We intentionally designed the BinaxNOW test and NAVICA app so we could offer a comprehensive testing solution to help Americans feel more confident about their health and lives,&quot; said Abbott CEO Robert B. Ford. &quot;BinaxNOW and the NAVICA app give us an affordable, easy-to-use, scalable test, and a complementary digital health tool to help us have a bit more normalcy in our daily lives.&quot;To date, Abbott has provided more than 27 million COVID-19 tests in the US, including 14 million detection tests and 13 million antibody tests.BTIG analyst Marie Thibault said that although Abbott did not provide revenue guidance last month, management nodded at mid-single-digit revenue growth for 2020, with the ability to possibly go higher.“Factors that could drive 2H outperformance include new product launches, fast recovery in the base business, and demand for COVID-related testing. We believe our forecast remains conservative,” said Thibault. “Even with a vaccine in place, COVID testing may take its place alongside flu testing and continue to be routinely used to some degree for the foreseeable future.”That being said, Thibault reiterated a Hold rating on the stock, adding that “shares trade at a midteens premium to their comp group and we feel the shares’ relative valuation appropriately reflects risk vs. reward”. (See Abbott stock analysis on TipRanks)The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus breaks down into 8 Buys versus 2 Holds and 1 Sell. With shares up 19% this year, the $108 average price target now implies a more modest 4.7% upside potential over the coming year.Related News:   Moderna Pops 6% On Covid-19 Vaccine Response In Older Adults; Analyst Says Buy Now   AstraZeneca Rises On Report Trump Could Fast-Track Covid-19 Vaccine Candidate   Merck Wins 2 Approvals For Keytruda Therapy In Japan More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Truist Lifts Medtronic’s PT On Growth Prospects   * Dick's 2Q Beats The Street As Shoppers Go Online   * Splunk Slips In Pre-Market As Revenue Outlook Disappoints; Street Stays Bullish   * NetApp Leaps 11% In After-Hours On Strong 1Q Results	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbott-jumps-22-emergency-nod-075554311.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-27	2020-08-27 01:52:14	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott Gets FDA Emergency Use Approval For $5 Rapid COVID-19 Test	The United States Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to a 15-minute COVID-19 test produced by Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) on Wednesday.What Happened:The BinaxNOW COVID-19 test, priced at $5, is capable of delivering test results without laboratory instrumentation and comes with an accompanying smartphone app that patients can use to display their results at no cost, Abbott said in a statement.The FDA granted the EUA with a caveat that negative results of the test don't rule out infection with SARS-COV-2 and the test should not be used as the sole basis for treatment.The drugmaker said it will start shipping tens of millions of these tests in September and plans to ramp up supply to 50 million tests a month at the beginning of October.Why It Matters: In March, Abbott launched a point-of-care ID NOW COVID-19 test,  which could reportedly provide a positive result in five minutes, that also received emergency use approval from the FDA.Detroit became the first city to deploy the tests to scan its first responders for the deadly virus in April.A month later, the drug regulator said the Chicago-based pharmaceutical company's test was returning frequent false negatives. This week, XpresSpa Group Inc (NASDAQ: XSPA) said it had struck a deal with Abbott to deploy the ID NOW tests at major airports like JFK International and Newark to cut testing time.Price Action: Abbott shares closed 0.7% higher at $103.19 on Wednesday and spiked nearly 11.9% in the after-hours session to $115.43.Photo courtesy: Abbott LaboratoriesSee more from Benzinga  * XpresSpa Shares Jump Over 18%, As Company Says It Has Expedited Airport COVID-19 Screening(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-07	2020-08-07 10:16:18	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	The Next Bull Run Will Be Harder For Sorrento Therapeutics	CNBC's Jim Cramer recently discussed some of the &quot;clueless buying&quot; that's been taking place in the markets. In particular, the Mad Money host is confounded about the Aug. 4 buying in Sorrento Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRNE) stock.Source: Shutterstock The longtime investment guru recommended SRNE stock several weeks ago when it was trading at $8. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInterestingly, while Cramer's bullish about the company's prospects due to its 30-minute spit test for the novel coronavirus, he has a hard time understanding why Sorrento's stock was up 30% a week after Sorrento's announcement. &quot;Turns out the market was just stupid because today, on the exact same news … Sorrento rallied 31% to just under $13. The stock market's supposed to be efficient, but somehow it took Wall Street six days to process this news,&quot; Cramer stated.   * 7 Travel Stocks to Buy Banking On Pent-Up DemandHe's kind of right. Sorrento Drops the Saliva NewsOn July 29, Sorrento issued a news release announcing it was entering into a licensing agreement with Columbia University for the rights to a rapid, one-step diagnostic test that detects SARS-CoV-2 virus from a saliva sample in 30 minutes.&quot;Unlike other commercially available diagnostic products, the test developed by Columbia's team, to be marketed by Sorrento under the COVI-TRACE™ name, holds all of the testing materials in a single tube and requires no specialized laboratory equipment, making it easily deployable for point of care, on-site or potentially at-home testing.&quot;That was a Wednesday. There were three days of trading between the announcement date and Aug. 4, the day its share price jumped by a third. If you include the weekend, that's almost six days. So, close enough.But it is weird, that at a time when the words Covid-19 have been said far more often than the number of U.S. cases, no one in the investment community took notice of something that could be vital to resuming normal activities in this country.  Is SRNE Stock All That and a Bag of Chips?Cramer was ahead of the curve when it comes to the San Diego-based clinical-stage, antibody-centric, biopharmaceutical company. The question is whether he's right or not. If he is, SRNE's current price of $13.61 is certainly not expensive based on future revenue potential. On the other hand, its stock has almost doubled in two weeks. It's now valued at 64x sales. That's a lot for a company that only had $16.7 million in sales and a $90.9 million loss through the first six months of 2020.Late to the Sorrento party, I'll lean on my InvestorPlace colleague, Josh Enomoto, who once worked for the company and lives in San Diego, to get a better feel for whether Cramer is barking up the wrong tree. Josh's most recent discussion about the company also happens to have occurred on Aug. 4, the same day as Cramer's comments.In his commentary, he points out that if the claims by the Columbia University Medical Center team and Sorrento are found to be accurate - a true positive rate of 97% and a true negative rate of 100% - SRNE stock would skyrocket. My words, not his. However, and this is something that bears repeating from time to time when dealing with development-stage biopharmaceutical companies: Claims aren't the same thing as proven capabilities.Not to mention, there are massive drug companies out there who spend billions on research and development to create new drugs. Sure, in recent years, Big Pharma has acquired its way to growth, but the pendulum seems to be swinging back in the direction of organically derived medicine. &quot;Bear in mind that the leaders in the diagnostic space are Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) and Roche Holding (OTCMKTS:RHHBY). As I just mentioned, Abbott has fielded many questions about its testing accuracy,&quot; Enomoto wrote.&quot;It's hard to believe that Sorrento won't at least face some setbacks when rigorous testing, including peer review and broadening the test sample size, are incorporated.&quot;My colleague is trying to point out that Sorrento is pivoting from being an oncology-focused firm to one solving the problems of the here and now. That's not an easy thing to do at the best of times. But when better-financed companies are stumbling to the finish line, the likelihood of Sorrento running the gauntlet free of setbacks does seem remote.  The Bottom LineIn past articles about Covid-19 related vaccines, treatments, and tests, I've recommended investors interested in placing a bet on one or more of the winners, make a safer play, and buy shares of the ETFMG Treatments Testing and Advancements ETF (NYSEARCA:GERM).Unfortunately, for investors interested in SRNE stock, it's not one of the 56 holdings owned by the ETF, so you're out of luck on the safety play. I bet if you asked Cramer how he feels about buying at almost $14 a share, he'd be a lot less bullish than he was at $8. Like my colleague, I'm neither a bull nor a bear when it comes to Sorrento, but I do think the climb to $20 will be a lot more difficult than the climb from single digits. I wouldn't buy SRNE stock, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't.  Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

2020-07-22	2020-07-22 09:30:04	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Covid-19 Testing Is Broken and There's No Plan to Fix It	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Many of the recent stories are familiar, but still distressing and perplexing.There was the gentleman in Tucson who waited 27 days to get results from a Covid-19 test, only to discover he didn’t have the virus and the two weeks he spent in quarantine had been pointless. There was the nonprofit nursing home chain in the Phoenix area that waited five days for test results, only to learn that several staff members and residents had the coronavirus; the asymptomatic staffers had roamed freely until the results arrived. And there have been many tales of Arizona residents waiting a week, on average, to get test results — and sometimes much longer — even though their state has been a coronavirus hotspot for more than a month. Texas, Florida, California and many other newly resurgent corona-states have similar stories.Test results, to be useful, should arrive in less than two days. If they take longer, opportunities to isolate infected people and trace their contacts with others wither, undermining broader containment efforts. So why can’t the wealthiest and most innovative country in the world have more rapid-fire testing during a pandemic?Several other wealthy countries already set good examples around testing that the U.S. might have emulated, measures including national testing strategies and aggressive contact tracing. The U.S. also had a lag between its first coronavirus outbreaks in the spring and the current surge, which gave private and public stakeholders in the testing community a chance to catch up. Yet even though testing has ramped up massively — to about 780,000 tests a day, from 145,000 per day in early April — some experts say that to combat the coronavirus effectively the country should be conducting at least 5 million tests a day. Federal health authorities recently said the U.S. has already reached its daily testing capacity, but by fall should have the ability to conduct about 1.3 million to 1.7 million tests a day. That would be an improvement, but clearly not enough — especially if a second coronavirus wave washes across America come October or November.Even now, the spread of the virus has outpaced testing increases. (In Arizona, in-state testing volume jumped 50% while the growth in new Covid-19 cases exceeded 100%.) More testing isn’t a solution anyhow if results aren’t prompt. And the sheer number of cases in the U.S. adds to the problem. During the spring, coronavirus cases peaked at about 36,000 a day. Last Thursday, more than 75,000 infections were reported — a new record. That same day, a bipartisan group of health care experts, scientists, former senior public officials and investors released a report warning of further economic and social devastation if Covid-19 is left unchecked.“Testing is the only way out of our present disaster, and it will remain the case until a vaccine or effective therapeutics are widely available,” noted the report, which was sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation. The authors call for $75 billion in immediate public spending to buttress the testing effort, which would be “the single best investment America could make in averting an even more tragic and pending disaster.”Even if you don’t believe the coronavirus has brought on an apocalypse, it still makes sense to fix and fortify national testing to protect public health before other disasters arrive. A civilized, equitable and well-functioning country shouldn’t be satisfied with the current testing regime. Rather, it should set to work to establish effective public-private partnerships, embrace the role of the federal and state governments as problem solvers, and hold the private sector to higher standards.While the Trump administration and the federal government have drawn ample criticism for leadership failures around testing, the private sector has also proved unequal to the epic challenges a pandemic presents.Federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state labs and hospitals all provide testing services, but commercial labs dominate the market. The clinical testing business, which generates annual revenue of about $80 billion, has a number of big players, including ARUP Laboratories, BioReference Laboratories, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, and Sonic Healthcare Ltd. But two aggressive competitors, Quest Diagnostics Inc. and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, dominate the field.Quest earned $858 million on revenue of $7.7 billion in 2019. The company says its operations “touch the lives” of 30% of the U.S. adult population and it boasts of relationships with about half of all physicians and hospitals in the country. LabCorp earned $824 million on revenue of $11.5 billion last year. It says it interacts with 3 million patients weekly, controls proprietary data derived from 35 billion lab test results (which includes about 50% of the U.S. population), and has contributed to the development of all 50 of the country’s top-selling drugs.Both companies were assembled through decades of mergers and acquisitions, diagnostic ingenuity and an unrelenting focus on expanding their market share. Quest and Labcorp are preferred or exclusive providers for many of the largest private health insurance companies in the U.S., and they process a large portion of tests covered by Medicare and Medicaid.Quest, in its securities filings, describes the testing market as “fragmented and highly competitive.” But Quest and LabCorp’s sales suggest they jointly control about a quarter of the business. Smaller competitors have complained over the years that Quest and Labcorp’s tight relationships with insurers and the federal government make it hard for them to break into health care networks to offer alternatives. Some consumers have alleged that the companies charge exorbitant prices for tests administered to uninsured patients, and both companies have drawn scrutiny for possibly overbilling Medicare and Medicaid (charges that they’ve denied).In the spring, questions about how readily insurers would cover charges from all companies for Covid-19 tests, along with many patients’ reluctance to visit doctors’ offices, brutalized the testing industry’s bottom line. Quest and LabCorp seem to have weathered this better than most; the stocks of both companies are trading around their 52-week highs. Yet even they haven’t been able to meet the testing demands imposed by Covid-19.As the virus rampaged in June and July, both companies, having rapidly upped their testing game, still lagged. A three-to-five-day turnaround time for test results they announced at the end of June gave way to a four-to-five-day delay by the first week of July. After announcing the second delay, Quest said it didn’t expect to get any faster until the coronavirus stopped spreading nationally. Don’t expect that to happen anytime soon. In an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday, a senior Quest executive said “it will be impossible” for his company “to increase coronavirus testing capacity to cope with demand during the autumn flu season.”That leaves patients, hospitals and society in a bind. Consider Arizona, which has the highest Covid-19 positivity rate of any state. The virus has spread there so quickly and deeply that a public health official in the state’s most populous county has said contact tracing may have become worthless. Sonora Quest Laboratories — a partnership between Quest and the Banner Health hospital chain — handles 80% of Covid-19 tests in Arizona, making it the largest testing network in the state. And it can take 11 days for Sonora Quest to deliver test results.Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican caught flat-footed by the outbreak, recently channeled $1 million in state funds to Sonora Quest to help buy equipment to process tests more quickly. He’s also started pushing a new testing partnership with Arizona State University, and he’s working with the federal government to set up free testing sites. Perhaps he will have better luck than Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, a Democrat, who said she requested federal testing sites in April and was rebuffed by the White House.But Ducey comes late to his testing push, having been reluctant to impose other public health measures such as stay-at-home orders, masks and lockdowns. And regardless of his new incentives, it’s not clear how quickly Sonora Quest can ramp up testing and improve turnaround times.Another governor decided to circumvent the major labs altogether. New York’s Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has advised his state’s residents to patronize local labs rather than Quest or LabCorp to get timely test results. About 70% of New York’s tests are now processed by 200 local labs that return results in one to three days, the state said.Smaller labs around the country have excess capacity they’re unable to deploy because they haven’t been able to break into the insurance networks dominated by the big guys. And labs of all sizes struggle to operate at full capacity because a balkanized supply chain forces them to compete against one another for frequently scarce resources.Those resources include reagents (the chemicals labs use to detect the presence of a virus), swabs for collecting patient samples, personal protective equipment, tubes and other media used to transport samples, and proprietary test kits that work with diagnostic machines from companies such as Hologic Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Abbott Laboratories. Those kits are a special challenge because they’re not interchangeable: Labs that use machines made by Hologic, for example, can’t use kits designed for machines made by Thermo Fisher. A dearth of testing kits was a problem in the spring. Now there’s a dearth of testing machines. All of this has become a tar pit for labs and their employees working around the clock.To top it off, the testing industry has technology and data challenges. As the New York Times recently detailed in a bit of startling reporting, some test results are still transmitted via fax machines and traditional mail, 80% of Covid-19 test results lack demographic information, and 50% have no associated addresses. Privacy requirements explain much of the problem, but it nonetheless hobbles testing during a pandemic.Will companies sort this out on their own? No, because they’re competing against one another. Can states help? No, they’re competing against one another, too. That leaves the federal government as the logical referee. It’s Washington that can define and coordinate a national testing program, provide financial incentives to companies to speed things up, help steer resources so as to rationalize supply chains, and revivify a dilapidated public health infrastructure undermined by years of staffing and budget cuts.However, the possibility of federal action collides with longstanding suspicion, and often outright hostility, in the U.S. toward centralized public health guidance and services. Countering that sentiment, and driving a national testing strategy, will require creative and purposeful leadership from Washington — and from the White House in particular.When Covid-19 first escalated in the spring, President Donald Trump briefly came to recognize there was battle to be fought. “I view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president,” he said in March. “It’s a medical war. We have to win this war. It’s very important.”But one month after setting up a coronavirus task force in the White House and putting his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of expanding testing, Trump effectively shifted primary responsibility for the battle to the states. It was as if, during World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt had told governors to devise their own military strategies and produce their own tanks, ships and planes.During the brief period the White House took the reins, some progress was made. More testing sites were opened and significant supply chain problems were tackled. An effort to offer drive-through testing services in commercial parking lots got underway. But Trump’s promise in the spring that “anybody that wants a test can get a test” wasn’t true then and it’s still not true today — largely because the president failed to forge a national consensus around testing in partnership with governors and public and private laboratories.More recently, Trump has repeatedly denounced testing. And the White House has been trying to cut billions of dollars for testing and other public health initiatives that Republicans in Congress want baked into the next round of bailout funding. At a press briefing on Tuesday, Trump declined to say whether he personally supported further funding for testing. In the midst of a national crisis, that animus toward testing is reckless and dangerous.Whoever is elected president in November may be enjoying his victory just as Covid-19 unleashes a brutal winter surge. Whether that’s Trump or Joe Biden, he will need to put the weight of the federal government behind initiatives to bolster public health services generally and break the testing logjam specifically.An obvious first step would be for the White House to help speed up the creation and distribution of simple point-of-care tests that can be used in doctors’ offices, private residences, nursing homes, schools — anywhere they’re needed outside of laboratory settings, especially in underserved, low-income communities. These tests can produce results in an hour or less, but also have significant accuracy problems. There’s already ample research underway to improve POC tests, and the federal government has approved a small number for emergency use, including devices from Abbott, Quidel Corp. and Becton, Dickinson and Company. But there’s much work to be done there.The U.S. has been playing catch-up on coronavirus testing almost from the start, ever since the faulty Covid-19 test the CDC sent to labs in early February turned out to be disastrously ineffective. Since then the government, which previously handled the development and distribution of diagnostic tests, has granted a series of emergency approvals for private companies to produce new tests. In contrast, Germany and South Korea have kept looser leashes on test development, bolstering their ability to test more broadly and effectively. The U.S. government would do well to continue loosening some of its testing regulations.On the other hand, the government could use its regulatory powers to suppress any anti-competitive practices that some of the bigger testing companies may be engaging in. A more muscular interpretation of the Defense Production Act would also enable the White House to resolve myriad supply problems, whether by ensuring the availability and compatibility of testing equipment or by smoothing access to such basics as swabs and reagents.The CDC, which Trump has undermined, could help institute a more effective testing regime by working with its traditional network of state public health agencies and private companies — if its budget was fortified and its regulatory and legal powers were enhanced. The CDC currently offers guidelines that states can take or leave. An empowered CDC should be authorized to devise enforceable rules that help rationalize how the testing industry operates.Analysts, experts and medical professionals from ideologically diverse institutions — including the American Enterprise Institute, Duke University, Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University and the Rockefeller Foundation — have recently issued detailed reports calling for bolder steps to streamline and reinvent the U.S. testing system. All of them advocate a broader role for the federal government, ranging from coordinating information and supplies and supporting POC innovations to providing financial incentives, establishing private-public mega-labs, and establishing task forces to help carry out these initiatives.The Harvard study goes so far as to call for the creation of a federal “Pandemic Testing Board” with “strong but narrow powers that has the job of securing the testing supply and the infrastructure necessary for deployment of testing.” The authors liken this to the War Production Board that the U.S. empowered for three years during World War II to supervise the production of weapons and military supplies.That makes sense to me. After all, we won World War II and we’re now at war with Covid-19. Even Trump knows that.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Timothy L.

2020-07-17	2020-07-17 14:24:44	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	A Peek Into Abbott's Price Over Earnings	In the current session, Abbott Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: ABT) is trading at $98.72, after a 2.44% spike. Over the past month, the stock increased by 8.87%, and in the past year, by 12.09%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently under from its 52 week high by 1.28%.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Abbott Laboratories Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 142.23 of the Medical Devices industry. Ideally, one might believe that they might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued.P/E ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance.

2020-05-22	2020-05-22 21:37:10	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	U.S. Cases Up 1.8%; Trump Pushes to Open Churches: Virus Update	(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump declared houses of worship as essential and directed governors to let them open “right now,” even though legal experts said he lacks the authority to override stay-at-home orders.Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said it may be time to consider a cautious reopening of the economy. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said two more regions, including Long Island and Westchester County, could open next week if they meet certain metrics.Oxford University and AstraZeneca started recruiting for advanced human studies of one of the fastest-moving experimental vaccines, while a Russian institute said it used laboratory staff in a successful unofficial test on a potential vaccine.Key Developments:Virus Tracker: Cases top 5.1 million; deaths around 336,000Coronavirus is a stress test many world leaders are failingMillions face risk of virus contagion in storm-hit South AsiaDefault notices pile up as shuttered retailers can’t pay rentNobody’s happy about all the contact-tracing apps out nowBankers to the ultra-rich deprived of glamor turn to ZoomScared and sick, U.S. meat workers crowd into reopened plantsSubscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg’s Prognosis team here. Click VRUS on the terminal for news and data on the coronavirus. For a look back at this week’s top stories from QuickTake, click here.U.K. Police Question Johnson Aide (5:37 p.m. NY)Boris Johnson’s chief adviser was interviewed by police for potentially breaking the U.K. government’s lockdown rules when he self-isolated with coronavirus symptoms. Police spoke to Dominic Cummings after he was seen more than 250 miles (400 kilometers) from his London home shortly after he went into isolation at the end of March -- a time when the prime minister and Health Secretary Matt Hancock had both tested positive.At the time, U.K. citizens were under orders not to travel, and to stay at home. Cummings, a divisive behind-the-scenes figure within the administration, lives in London while his parents live in Durham, in northern England.Peru Continues Reopening Economy (5:15 p.m. NY)Peru authorized more businesses to reopen, including hairdressers, electricians and online clothes retailers along with mining, fishing and construction companies that were cleared to reopen this month. The lockdown, which was set to expire Sunday, will continue through June 30, President Martin Vizcarra said.Peru is battling South America’s biggest coronavirus outbreak after Brazil, with total cases surpassing 100,000 this week. Strict lockdown measures in place since mid-March have taken a heavy toll on the economy, with economic activity slumping 16% in March and more than a million jobs lost in Lima in the three months to April.California to Issue Religious Guidance (4:45 p.m. NY)California Governor Gavin Newsom said he’ll issue guidelines for reopening places of worship no later than Monday. In-person religious gatherings have so far been prohibited as the nation’s most populous state slowly lifts restrictions on residents.“We take the issue very, very seriously and to heart, and we’ve been very aggressive in trying to put together guidelines that will do justice to people’s health and their fundamental need and desire to practice their faith,” Newsom said at his daily briefing. President Donald Trump said earlier Friday that he would override governors who fail to reopen places of worship this weekend, without explaining what authority he had to do so.Newsom also said he was days away from issuing plans on reopening salons, barbershops and casinos.N.Y. Calls off Car Show (4:30 p.m. NY)Organizers of the New York auto show who had postponed the event to August are now calling it off for this year. “Because of the uncertainty caused by the virus, we feel it would not be prudent to continue with the 2020 show,” Mark Schienberg, president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, said in a statement.The annual event’s traditional venue, the Javits Convention Center in New York City, is being used as a field hospital. That has forced organizers of the auto show to abandon a summer show and instead push it to next April.CDC Cites Choirs, Collection Plate in Guidance (4:15 p.m. NY)Religious groups should consider suspending or limiting choirs or singing during services and avoid passing a collection plate, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in guidance issued hours after Trump demanded governors immediately open houses of worship. “The act of singing may contribute to transmission of Covid-19, possibly through emission of aerosols,” the CDC warned.Churches should stay in contact with local and state officials as reopening decisions are made, and provide protection for staff or congregants who are at higher risk of infection. The guidance encouraged hand washing, use of face coverings and increased cleaning and disinfection measures.“The information offered is non-binding public health guidance for consideration only; it is not meant to regulate or prescribe standards for interactions of faith communities in houses of worship,” the CDC said.U.S. Cases Increase 1.8% (4 p.m. NY)Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 1.8% as compared to the same time yesterday to 1.59 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. That’s above the 1.5% average of the psat week. Deaths rose 1.7% to 95,490.New York cases rose 0.5% to 358,154, in line with the average increase over the past seven days, according to the state’s health department.Florida cases rose 1.6% to 49,451 on Friday, compared with an average increase of 1.7% in the previous seven days, according to data from the state’s health department. Deaths rose 2.1% to 2,190.Cases in California rose 2.6% to 88,444 while deaths increased 2.5% to 3,630, according to the state’s website.Cases Reach All African Nations: WHO (3:15 p.m. NY)Every nation in Africa now has coronavirus cases, as the continent’s infection total exceeds 100,000, the World Health Organization said. The first Africa case was reported 14 weeks ago.Africa’s mortality rate has been low, with 3,100 confirmed deaths. By comparison, when cases reached 100,000 in Europe, deaths topped 4,900, WHO said. Early analysis suggests the lower mortality rate may reflect that Africa is the youngest continent, with more than 60% of the population under age 25. In Europe nearly 95% of deaths occurred in those older than 60.Cases continue to rise and while overall it took 52 days to reach the first 10,000 cases, it took only 11 days for Africa to move from 30,000 to 50,000 cases, WHO said.California Cases Rise 2.6% (2:53 p.m. NY)California’s confirmed cases climbed 2.6%, above the seven-day average of 2.37%, to a total of 88,444. There were 88 additional deaths, a 2.5% increase, for a total of 3,630.Trump Orders Churches Reopened (2:18 p.m. NY)President Donald Trump declared churches, synagogues and mosques to be essential services and ordered them opened immediately. State governors, whose stay-at-home orders precluded large gatherings for religious services, must let churches open this weekend, he said, though legal experts said he doesn’t have the authority to override state laws.“The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now,” Trump said in a White House statement.Religious organizations have been notable sites of outbreaks. In mid-March, a Bible study group meeting was tied to an outbreak of 35 confirmed cases in a rural county in Arkansas, according to a CDC report Tuesday.Ireland Mulls Traveler Isolation (1:30 p.m. NY)Ireland reported 115 new cases, the most in a week, ending a six-day stretch of fewer than 100 daily infections. There were 11 new deaths. Ireland said it will force travelers arriving in the country to detail their whereabouts for the first 14 days of their stay and is considering whether to force travelers to self-isolate for two weeks. The country has 1,592 deaths and 24,506 cases.Fauci: Time to Look at Cautious Reopening (1 p.m. NY)Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, said it may be time to begin to “seriously”’ look at reopening the economy in a cautious way.“I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,” Fauci said in a CNBC interview. Staying closed for too long may cause “irreparable damage,” said Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force.N.Y. Adds 2 Regions to Reopen (12:40 p.m. NY)Long Island and the Mid-Hudson region -- including Westchester County -- are on track to reopen, provided deaths continue to fall and contact-tracing targets are met, Governor Andrew Cuomo said. The state had 109 deaths on May 21, for a total of 23,192.With those areas, nine of 10 New York regions will have begun phased-in restarts, after more than seven weeks on lockdown. New York City still has met only four of seven metrics, due largely to a lack of capacity at city hospitals. It also must continue to build up its number of tracers, according to state data.Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city is moving toward a first phase of reopening, focusing on construction, wholesale distribution and curbside retail, by the middle of June.U.K. to Fine Quarantine Violators (12:30 p.m. NY)Passengers arriving in the U.K. will be forced into quarantine for two weeks and face fines of 1,000 pounds ($1,200) if they break the rules, Home Secretary Priti Patel said.The plan, starting June 8, is designed to stop travelers introducing the virus after becoming infected overseas, and is likely to have a major impact on the aviation industry’s attempts to recover from the lockdown. The measures will be reviewed every three weeks, along with the rest of the government’s response.“Now we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases,” Patel said.Italy’s Deaths, New Cases Remain Low (12:10 p.m. NY)Italy’s new cases remained below 1,000 for a 10th day on Friday, as health authorities said the epidemic’s curve is consistently descending in all regions, including Lombardy, the hardest-hit area. Authorities reported 652 cases, up from 642 a day earlier, for a total of 228,658. Daily fatalities were 130, down from 156 on Thursday, bringing the death toll to 32,616.Miami-Dade Sets Beach Opening (11:57 a.m. NY)Miami-Dade, Florida’s most populous county and home to Miami Beach, is targeting June 1 to reopen its famed seashore, the next major step for the region to emerge from its shutdown.Mayor Carlos Gimenez’s office said he agreed on the date in a virtual meeting Friday with mayors and city managers from communities on the coast. Officials will meet this weekend to craft rules for reopening, and meet with Gimenez on Tuesday.Miami-Dade began a phased reopening this week, but tourism has remained essentially shuttered.N.J. Eases Outdoor Crowd Limits (11:55 a.m. NY)New Jersey will permit outdoor gatherings of 25 people, up from 10, Governor Phil Murphy said. Indoor gatherings will still be limited to 10 people, he said at a news conference in Trenton. The state reported 146 new deaths, bringing the toll 10,985. An additional 1,394 new cases were reporting, pushing the total to 152,719, Murphy said.China Vaccine Shows Promise: Lancet (11:20 a.m. NY)An experimental vaccine developed by CanSino Biologics of China was safe and generated an immune response in an early study in humans.The vaccine stimulated production of both antibodies that can stop infection along with immune T-cells, according to a report Friday in The Lancet medical journal. Further research is needed to show its effectiveness against the virus, according to the study funded by CanSino and conducted by researchers from the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and other organizations.“The challenges in the development of a Covid-19 vaccine are unprecedented, and the ability to trigger these immune responses does not necessarily indicate that the vaccine will protect humans from Covid-19,” said Wei Chen, a professor at the Beijing institute that carried out the study, in the report.Infants Seen at Risk From Vaccine Disruption (11:14 a.m. NY)As the coronavirus pandemic disrupts routine visits to doctors’ offices, more than 80 million children under the age 1 are at risk of life-threatening diseases like polio and measles, according to the world’s top health agencies.Routine vaccinations of children have been substantially hindered in at least 68 countries, according to data from the World Health Organization; UNICEF; the Sabin Vaccine Institute; and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which helps immunize half the world’s children against diseases.The agencies said Friday that immunization services “have been disrupted on a global scale that may be unprecedented since the inception of expanded programs on immunization (EPI) in the 1970s.” They called upon countries to join an effort to resume campaigns against vaccine-preventable diseases and made recommendations on how to safely deliver shots amid the pandemic.Florida Cases Rise 1.6% (11:10 a.m. NY)Florida reported 49,451 Covid-19 cases on Friday, up 1.6% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 1.7% in the previous seven days. Deaths among Florida residents reached 2,190, an increase of 2.1%.The report marked a return toward the recent mean, after Thursday’s release showed the sharpest percentage uptick in case numbers since May 1. Florida is coming to the end of a week in which Miami-Dade and Broward, its most populous counties, joined the rest of the state in a phased reopening.Speaking Friday in Jacksonville, Governor Ron DeSantis said he’s lifting restrictions on youth activities including sports and summer camps.Cyprus Reopens Foreign Flights (10:40 a.m. NY)Cyprus will start allowing direct flights from some European countries on June 9, and it plans to end a mandatory 14-day quarantine for arriving visitors on Monday and reopen hotels on June 1.In the first stage, Cyprus will permit flights from Greece, Malta, Bulgaria, Norway, Austria, Finland, Slovenia, Hungary, Israel, Denmark, Germany, Slovakia and Lithuania. A second phase on June 20 will add Switzerland, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Estonia and the Czech Republic.Malaria Drugs Linked to Death, Heart Risk (9:30 a.m. NY)The antimalaria drugs touted by U.S. President Donald Trump to treat Covid-19 patients were linked to an increased risk of death and heart ailments in a study published in The Lancet medical journal. Trump said Monday that he had taken the drug for about a week.Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine didn’t benefit the patients either alone or in combination with an antibiotic, according to the study based on records of 15,000 people treated with the antimalarials and one of two antibiotics often paired with the drug. Treatment with any combination of the four drugs was associated with a higher risk of death than seen in 81,000 patients who didn’t receive them, the study found.Puerto Rico Cases Surpass 3,000 (8:14 a.m. NY)Confirmed coronavirus cases in Puerto Rico surpassed the 3,000 mark on Friday, as the Health Department said an additional 117 people had tested positive. This is the third time this month that more than 100 cases were detected in a 24-hour period.According to government figures, the pandemic has now affected 3,030 people and 126 have died. The figures come as the commonwealth of 3.2 million people pushes ahead with plans to reopen the economy after declaring a broad lock-down on March 16. On Tuesday, malls, retail outlets and restaurants will be allowed to resume operations.Russia Tests Covid-19 Vaccine on Researchers (8:10 a.m. NY)A Russian government research institute said it conducted successful unofficial tests on a potential coronavirus vaccine. Laboratory staff who volunteered to receive the vaccine at the Gamaleya epidemiology institute in Moscow had no side effects and are healthy, said its director, Alexander Ginzburg, the state-run Tass news service reported.It didn’t state how many people took part in the trial.Fauci Optimistic About Moderna Vaccine (7:36 a.m. NY)Moderna shares rose after Anthony Fauci, the leading U.S. infectious disease official, said he was optimistic about the company’s vaccine. “Even though there were only eight individuals, we saw neutralizing antibodies at a reasonable dose of the vaccine,” Fauci said on CNN. “Although the numbers were limited, it was really quite good news because it reached and went over an important hurdle in the development of vaccines. That’s the reason why I’m cautiously optimistic about it.”Fauci said on NPR that he expects the full results of a Phase 1 study of the biotech’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine within weeks. Earlier this week, an experimental vaccine from the company showed signs that it can create an immune-system response to fend off the new coronavirus. In 25 people who got either of the two smaller doses used in the study, researchers reported that the levels of antibodies equaled or exceeded the levels of antibodies found in patients who had recovered from the virus.The second test, evaluating the quality of those antibodies, was only available for eight of the people because it takes longer to perform. But in all eight people, the vaccine successfully stimulated the body to create antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus in the test tube, so it can no longer infect cells.Alibaba Growth Slows; Deere Tractor Sales Hold Up (7:15 a.m. NY)Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. reported its slowest pace of revenue growth on record after China’s economic contraction drove down spending across its online marketplaces. The results demonstrate the world’s second largest economy has yet to fully shake off Covid-19, with consumers still hesitant about spending on big-ticket items.Deere & Co. shares rose after the world’s biggest tractor maker navigated coronavirus upheavals better than expected in the height of the pandemic. For the three months through April, sales and earnings fell less than analysts projected as agriculture -- deemed essential in the lockdown era -- proves more resilient than many other industries.U.K. Contact-Tracing App Roll-Out Delayed (6:20 a.m. NY)Britain’s mobile phone app for tracking coronavirus infections has been delayed by bureaucracy and the addition of more symptoms to monitor, according to a person familiar with the matter -- who said they expected the government to abandon it in favor of the model backed by Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.The app is being developed by VMware Inc. and Zuhlke Engineering Ltd at a cost of 4.7 million pounds ($5.8 million). There has been controversy about the U.K.’s decision to reject the structure backed by Apple and Google, a move that has been criticized by privacy campaigners.The U.K. has opted for a “centralized” model, where people who test positive for coronavirus upload all their recent contacts to a database, and those people are then contacted and warned. Apple Inc. and Google released their Covid-19 exposure-notification tools on Wednesday. Some governments have criticized the “decentralized” system because it doesn’t let authorities store data on who has the virus and track where it is spreading. Instead, it just notifies individuals if they have been exposed.Germany Plans One-Time Child Bonus (6 a.m. NY)German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz is planning a one-time bonus for families of 300 euros ($327) per child as part of a government stimulus program worth as much as 150 billion euros, Der Spiegel magazine reported, without identifying the source of its information. The bonus could cost the government 5 billion to 6 billion euros. Scholz is also considering vouchers to boost consumer spending.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asia-counts-economic-toll-brazil-005754518.html?.tsrc=rss

Abbott's data has so far shown that the test, which can be used at the point of care and produces results in minutes, finds positive cases of COVID-19 nearly 95% of the time when compared with two other tests performed in laboratories.

2020-05-21	2020-05-21 19:18:45	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	U.K. Buys 10 Million Antibody Tests from Roche and Abbott	(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. agreed to buy 10 million coronavirus antibody tests from Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG and Abbott Laboratories Ltd, in a boost to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he tries to ease the country back to normality.The tests will be crucial to aid understanding of the spread of the disease, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Thursday at a press conference from 10 Downing Street. They will be rolled out in a phased way starting next week, he said.“This is an important milestone and it represents further progress in our national testing program” Hancock said. “Knowing that you have these antibodies will help us to understand more in the future: if you are at lower risk of catching coronavirus, of dying from coronavirus and transmitting coronavirus.”Making antibody tests widely available may help Britain lift its lockdown restrictions, because they show who has already had the virus and might have a degree of immunity. That would mean they could resume social contact with others. However, scientists still aren’t sure whether having antibodies means long-lasting protection from the disease.In other developments on Thursday:A trial began of a 20-minute test to show whether patients have coronavirusA surveillance study carried out for the government suggested 17% of Londoners and 5% of the national population has had the virus, based on the presence of Covid-19 antibodiesUnder political pressure, Johnson ditched a plan to make migrant workers in the NHS and care homes pay a health surcharge, promising them an exemptionRoche’s test, which was cleared by a U.K. health authority earlier this month, had previously garnered praise in Germany and the U.S. for its reliability. It won emergency use in the U.S. earlier this month and clearance for countries accepting Europe’s CE marking. Roche expects production to reach the high double-digit millions by June and pass the 100 million monthly threshold later this year.Abbott on May 15 said its test had been approved for use in the U.K. and that it could supply as many as 5 million a month. The test has also been approved in Canada.The antibody tests will be free to access through the National Health Service and care workers would be prioritized, Hancock said. Johnson previously described antibody tests as a “game-changer” in the response to the virus.Hancock said a separate coronavirus test developed by the manufacturer OptiGene has been put into trials from Thursday. It can show whether a patient has the virus within 20 minutes. “We will monitor its effectiveness very closely, and if it works, we’ll roll it out as soon as we can,” he said. A successful, fast test would help track the spread of the virus.U-TurnThe OptiGene test has been “highly effective” when used in clinical settings, and will now be tried out in care homes, doctors’ offices and emergency units, the Health Department said. As many as 4,000 people will be tested in the county of Hampshire in southern England.Despite the positive news on testing, Johnson also suffered a political blow Thursday when his government was forced into a U-turn over a health care surcharge to migrant NHS and care home workers that the premier had defended in the House of Commons on Wednesday.At the weekly session of Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, opposition Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer had asked Johnson if he thought the 400-pound charge -- set to rise to 624 pounds -- was “right.” The premier responded that while he appreciated the “importance” of the question, the charge was “the right way forward,” bringing 900 million pounds into the NHS a year.But on Thursday he changed tack, with his office saying the premier has asked ministers to remove NHS and care workers from the surcharge “as soon as possible.”(Adds details of Johnson U-turn in final three paragraphs.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-k-buys-10-million-180336828.html?.tsrc=rss

Tax Revenue Fell 68% in April (5:40 p.m. NY)New York state’s tax revenue plummeted 68.4% in April, as the lockdowns and the extension of tax return filings to July 15 took a toll.

Personal income-tax revenue fell more than $7 billion from last April, a drop that was primarily due to the delayed tax filing deadline.“New York is facing economic devastation not seen since the Great Depression,” New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a news release. “New York and other hard-hit states need the federal government to step up and provide assistance, or the state will have to take draconian actions to balance its budget.”Portual Set to Reopen Beaches (4:50 p.m. NY)Portugal plans to reopen beaches popular with tourists on June 6 as the government eases confinement measures and adopts new rules to keep 1.5 meters (5 feet) between people, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said at a Lisbon news conference.

Markets settled as the Fed flooded the financial system with liquidity.U.S. Cases Rise 2%, Above Week Average (4 p.m. NY)Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 2% compared with the same time Thursday to 1.43 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News.

Madrid and Barcelona, the nation’s two biggest cities, will remain in the restrictive first phase, he said. Certain rules also are being eased, such as allowing shops to operate without the need for appointments, but Illa said limits will remain on the number of employees per client.Mall of America to Reopen June 1 (2:20 p.m. NY)Minnesota’s sprawling Mall of America will reopen June 1, two weeks after the state allowed on-site retail to resume. The mall, which got 40 million annual visitors before the pandemic, said tenants need time to rehire and train staff as well as clean, sanitize and take safety measures. When open, the 2.5-million-square-foot mall near Minneapolis will limit customers to 50% of capacity. Restaurants and play areas will stay closed until state officials approve.Florida Allows Gyms to Reopen (1:28 p.m NY)Florida gyms can reopen, and retailers and restaurants will be able to operate at 50% indoor capacity, up from 25%, starting Monday, Governor Ron DeSantis said.The state started reopening last week, with DeSantis saying the Sunshine State had dodged the worst-case scenarios predicted by some analysts.

Travelers will get a cash reimbursement or a voucher for a future flight worth 15% more than the initial ticket value, according to a statement. The incentive is to encourage customers to opt for future flights.Through March 31, the value of tickets for flights that may be canceled and for which the airline could be liable for vouchers or refunds reached about 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion), according to the carrier.WHO Pushes Vaccine Access Plan (12:30 p.m. NY)The World Health Organization is pushing a proposal that aims to ensure broad access to Covid-19 treatments and vaccines while offering an appropriate reward to creators.Under the plan offered by Costa Rica, drug companies would voluntarily donate Covid-related intellectual property to a global pool.

The USNS Comfort spent April in New York City on a similar mission.Another Brazil Health Chief Leaves (11:30 a.m. NY)Brazil’s health minister quit the post less than a month after his predecessor was fired by President Jair Bolsonaro amid a clash over social distancing steps.

The shares fell in early trading.The company said it couldn’t estimate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic beyond the coming quarter, joining a growing list of companies pulling their financial forecasts for the year. Sales and profit in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended March 28, both missed Wall Street’s estimates.“Through the first ten months of fiscal 2020 our business delivered results above our stated long-term growth objectives,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Rendle said in a statement. “Then the world changed for all of us as a result of Covid-19.”Fiat Seeks $6.8 Billion State-Backed Loan (7:40 a.m. NY)Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is in talks to obtain a state-backed credit line of about 6.3 billion euros ($6.8 billion) to strengthen the carmaker’s financial buffer against the steep downturn caused by the coronavirus, according to people familiar with the matter.Fiat’s local unit is discussing the facility with Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, which is the lead lender, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private.

Orban’s comments, reported from a press briefing in Serbia, bring forward the end to a potentially indefinite state of emergency announced in March. The move triggered European Union criticism about whether he was using the pandemic as pretext for a power grab.A Third of U.K. Workers Deemed Vital (7:25 a.m. NY)One in three U.K. workers are in jobs deemed vital during the coronavirus lockdown, and many of them are at heightened risk of contracting the disease. The Office for National Statistics said Friday there were 10.6 million so-called key workers last year and 15% of them are at moderate risk from Covid-19 because of a health condition such as asthma, heart disease and diabetes.The findings are likely to renew calls to improve pay and conditions for those on the front line in the battle against the pandemic, who in general earn less than employees in other occupations. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that a third of key workers get less than the target rate for the national minimum wage.Singapore to Allow More Laborers to Resume Work (7:10 a.m. NY)Singapore will allow more construction laborers to return to work as the city-state looks to restart an economy that has been largely shut because of the coronavirus pandemic. The country will gradually add about 5% of the construction workforce, or about 20,000 workers, from June 2, on top of an existing 5% currently working on critical infrastructure projects.An outbreak among low-wage migrant workers staying in cramped dormitories has led Singapore to record one of the largest virus tallies in Asia. Of the nearly 27,000 total confirmed cases, about 90% are infections among workers in dormitories. Officials said this week that infection rates among this group are “stabilizing” and some 20,000 foreign workers will be ready for discharge from care facilities by the end of May.Cigarette Maker’s Vaccine Poised for Human Tests (6:58 a.m. NY)An experimental Covid-19 vaccine developed by cigarette maker British American Tobacco Plc is poised to begin testing in humans. Pre-clinical tests of the vaccine showed a positive immune response, the London-based tobacco company said Friday in a statement. The first phase of human trials could begin as soon as late June if authorized by drug regulators, BAT said.Drugmakers from around the world have jumped into the vaccine race, with more than 100 candidates in development in the U.S., Europe, China and other regions. BAT rival Philip Morris International Inc. is also testing an immunization. Smoking cigarettes, the two companies’ main products, may raise the risk of severe Covid symptoms, according to the World Health Organization.BAT subsidiary Kentucky BioProcessing uses tobacco plants in making the experimental vaccine, which is derived from the genetic sequence of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid. According to BAT, the method generates the vaccine faster than conventional approaches, reducing the time required from several months to about six weeks.U.K. Northerners, Diabetics Among Most Vulnerable (6:33 a.m. NY)People in the North of England and diabetics are far more likely to die from coronavirus, data compiled by the U.K. national health service show. More than a quarter of all fatalities from Covid-19 were people with diabetes, according to the data, which for the first time breaks down deaths by underlying condition. In Northern England, 7,089 people died, nearly double the number of deaths in the South.Separate data from the Office for National Statistics show that more than 27% of care home deaths in England & Wales from March 2 through May 1 were linked to Covid-19. There were 73,180 deaths in the facilities from Dec. 28 to May 1, more than 23,000 above the same period a year earlier.E-Commerce Surge Boosts JD.com (6:02 a.m. NY)JD.com Inc. forecast a 20% to 30% rise in revenue, demonstrating how operating its own warehouses and delivery fleet is helping the e-commerce giant weather China’s economic slowdown. Revenue at China’s second largest online retailer rose a better-than-expected 21% in the March quarter. It forecast sales of between 180 billion yuan and 195 billion yuan this quarter, versus an average analyst estimate for 177.1 billion yuan.JD, which reported results before rivals Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Pinduoduo Inc., shows how China’s Covid-19 lockdown is pushing shoppers online, fueling an e-commerce boom. Investors expected JD to better endure the downturn thanks to a direct sales and in-house logistics model that helped it navigate supply disruptions. It’s gained $13 billion in market value since the novel coronavirus emerged in January.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/italy-open-travel-second-wave-145232760.html?.tsrc=rss

(NYSE: ABT) is trading at $90.55, after a 1.3% decrease. Over the past month, the stock fell by 5.69%, but over the past year, it actually increased by 19.51%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 9.45%.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 120.07 in the medical devices industry, Abbott Laboratories has a lower P/E ratio of 46.35. Shareholders might be inclined to think that they might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.There are many limitations to price to earnings ratio.

Negative results may need to be confirmed with a high-sensitivity authorized molecular test,"" Director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health at the FDA, Tim Stenzel, said in a statement.""We will continue to study the data available and are working with the company to create additional mechanisms for studying the test,"" he added.The FDA said it received 15 ""adverse event reports"" about the Abbott ID Now device used for COVID-19 testing, suggesting some of the results were inaccurately negative.The agency is investigating the cause of the false negatives, including whether they could be caused by the types of swabs used for taking samples, or the material used to transport the specimen, the statement noted.Abbott will conduct post-market clinical trials involving at least 150 COVID-19 patients to further assess the accuracy, according to the FDA.Why It Matters President Donald Trump had recently said that Abbott's ID Now point-of-care devices were used to screen him and other officials at the White House for coronavirus.A study at the New York University concluded that Abbott's test missed 48% of COVID-19 positive cases that were detected by a rival company's testing kits, Washington Post reported.Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb similarly warned about accuracy of Abbott's tests in an interview with CBS News, but dubbed the antigen test, like the one developed by Quidel Corporation (NASDAQ: QDEL) as a ""real game changer.""Price Action Abbott shares closed 0.4% lower at $91.79 on Thursday and slipped another 3.6% in the after-hours session at $88.50.Image Credit: Abbott.comSee more from Benzinga  * In A First, Bank Of America Sells Bonds To Fund Coronavirus Response  * Taiwanese Apple Supplier TSMC To Build B US Chip Factory After Months Of Pressure From Trump Administration  * Apple Confirms Acquisition Of Virtual Reality Startup NextVR(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The rate would then remain near 10% at year-end, near the highs of the last recession, they wrote.U.S. Cases Rise 1.6% (4 p.m. NY)U.S. cases rose 1.6% from the day before to 1.38 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. That was higher than Tuesday’s growth rate of 1.4%, but below the average increase of 1.9% over the past week. Deaths rose 1.8% to 83,249.Florida reported 42,402 cases on Wednesday, up 1.1% from a day earlier, according to the state’s health department. That was under the 1.6% average increase of the past week. Deaths rose 2.7% to 1,827.New York reported 166 deaths, keeping daily fatalities under 200 for a third day, according to Governor Andrew Cuomo. The state also added 2,176 cases, for a total of 340,661.California cases rose 2.5% to 71,141 while deaths increased 3.1% to 2,934, according to the state’s website.Texas cases climbed 3.3%, above the 3% average of the past week, to a total of 42,403.Ex-Glaxo Official, General to Lead Vaccine Hunt (3:52 p.m. NY)President Donald Trump plans to name Moncef Slaoui, the former head of GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s vaccines division, and Gustave Perna, a four-star U.S. general, to lead a Manhattan Project-style effort to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, two people familiar with the matter said.Slaoui, 60, and Perna will oversee the initiative known as Operation Warp Speed, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of an announcement expected later Wednesday. Slaoui will work on a volunteer basis. The Trump administration project seeks to produce 300 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine by the end of the year, hastening development by simultaneously testing many different candidates and beginning production before they’ve completed clinical trials.Italy Approves $60 Billion Stimulus Package (2:58 p.m. NY)Italy’s government approved a much-delayed 55 billion-euro ($60 billion) stimulus package to rescue an economy crippled by a two-month nationwide lockdown, promising a boost in liquidity for businesses and aid for families in need.The new spending includes emergency income measures, extra funding for companies and tax cuts for some 4 billion euros. Non-reimbursable grants for small and medium-sized companies will also be available.French Deaths at Slowest Pace in Three Days (2:45 p.m. NY)French virus deaths rose at the slowest pace in three days on Wednesday, with fewer than 100 deaths for the third time in five days at 83. New cases were little changed over the day at 213,664. Hospitalizations fell by 524 to 21,071, the lowest since March 30. Patients in intensive care because of the virus, which health officials consider a key indicator of the pressure on France’s health-care system, fell by 114 to 2,428, about a third of the peak in April.France has started easing lockdown measures that helped slow the coronavirus outbreak, with many stores reopening after almost eight weeks. The number of people in France who had been infected was estimated to be 2.8 million as of May 11, or 4.4% of the population, according to a study based on modeling published in Science magazine on Wednesday.“The epidemic remains active and the virus is still circulating,” the ministry said. “We must remain cautious.”U.K. Aid Claims Top $416 Million on First Day (2:25 p.m. NY)The U.K. government’s coronavirus aid program for self-employed people received more than 340 million pounds ($416 million) of claims in its first morning of operation. Some 110,000 people had applied for the cash grants by noon on Wednesday, Jim Harra, chief executive officer of the U.K. tax authority, told Sky News in an interview.“They are all eligible claimants” who should receive payments by May 25, he said. The program, announced in March, allows self-employed workers to claim a one-time grant equivalent to 80% of their average monthly profit for three months.N.J. Revenue Plunges Ahead of Reopening (2:04 p.m NY)New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced the first steps for reopening the state as it saw April revenue plummet 60% from a year ago, a reminder of the financial toll exacted by the coronavirus pandemic.Retail businesses will be allowed to offer curbside pickup starting May 18, and restrictions will lift on non-essential construction work, Murphy said Wednesday at a news briefing. Customers won’t be permitted inside non-essential stores. “They will have to continue placing orders in advance,” Murphy said.New Jersey lost an unprecedented $3.5 billion of revenue in April. The data, from state officials, are the first full monthly tally since Murphy closed businesses, workplaces and government services on March 21.N.Y. Probes Illness in Kids (1:40 p.m. NY)New York state is investigating 102 reported cases of an inflammatory disease in young children that’s thought to be related to the coronavirus, Governor Andrew Cuomo said, after a 5 year-old boy in New York City, a 7 year-old boy in Westchester County, and an 18 year-old girl in Suffolk County died.The disease causes inflammation of the blood vessels and can affect the heart, he said. Of the cases being investigated, the children showed symptoms of an inflammatory disease like the Kawasaki disease or toxic shock-like syndrome, he said. At the request of the CDC, the state is helping to develop the criteria for identifying and responding to the illness; 14 other states and five European countries have reported cases.About 60% of the children displaying the symptoms tested positive for Covid-19 and 40% tested positive for antibodies. Of those, 71% have resulted in ICU admissions, 19% in intubations, and 43% remain hospitalized, Cuomo said.The state reported its first rise in new cases in five days after ramping up testing to 33,794 people from 20,463 the day before.Vaccine Just One Step In Stopping Virus, WHO Warns (1:15 p.m. NY)The “massive moonshot” of finding a Covid-19 vaccine will be only the first step toward eradicating the disease, a World Health Organization official warned, saying that access must be ensured around the world.“Science can come up with the vaccine, but someone has got to make it, and we’ve got to make enough of it that everyone can get a dose of it, and we have got to be able to deliver that, and people have got to want to take that vaccine,” said Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s health emergencies program. “Every single one of those steps is fraught with challenges.”It’s impossible to make promises now about when the virus could be eradicated, Ryan said, noting that resistance to vaccine use has contributed to the spread of diseases, such as measles.U.S. House Republicans Urge WHO, China Probes (12:50 p.m. NY)Republicans want a new congressional panel created to monitor coronavirus dollars to also investigate “the actions and inactions” of the World Health Organization, China and the U.S. House of Representatives itself in the early stages of the outbreak.The demands are included in a list of rules the GOP wants the Democratic-led committee to adopt as safeguards against “partisan political ends,” in a letter delivered just hours before the panel is holds its first hearing Wednesday on how to safely reopen the U.S. economy.London Subway Trips Slowly Rise (12:48 p.m. NY)London Underground ridership was up 7.3% from the same time last week, equating to about 5,700 extra journeys, according to transit operators Transport for London, as most people stayed at home or found alternative routes to work after the government recommended avoiding public transport. That was broadly in line with increases in recent weeks, TfL said in an email.London’s financial district is preparing for office workers to return by proposing to temporarily close some main roads and add one-way pedestrian walkways to give people more space for walking and cycling to avoid trains and buses. Some 520,000 people work in the area, knowns as the City of London.Italy New Cases Fall (12:07 p.m. NY)Italy registered the fewest new coronavirus cases in two days on Wednesday, as the government prepared to approve a much-postponed 55 billion-euro ($60 billion) stimulus package for an economy blighted by a nationwide lockdown.Civil protection authorities reported 888 cases -- the least since Monday -- compared with 1,402 a day earlier, taking confirmed cases to 222,104. Daily fatalities rose to 195 from 172 on Tuesday, with a total of 31,106 reported since the start of the pandemic in late February.DC Extends Stay-at-Home Order (11:55 a.m. NY)Washington DC is extending its stay-at-home order until June 8, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Wednesday. She’s said she wants to see a continuous two-week decline in cases before moving forward with re-opening the nation’s capitol.“Obviously we are not there yet,” Bowser said during a press conference.The order had been scheduled to expire Friday. The city has had 6,584 confirmed cases of the virus and 350 deaths, according to city data.EU Working on Economic Recovery Plan (11:45 a.m. NY)European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament that she’s working on an “ambitious” plan to help economies recover from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. which would sit alongside the bloc’s regular budget and be funded in part by borrowing on financial markets.The recovery instrument proposal is still being revised by EU officials, with member states fighting over how it should be funded. Any plan will have to be endorsed by the parliament and national governments.The plan would see most of the funds spent on public investments and reforms in the countries most deeply affected by the coronovirus lockdown. Von der Leyen stressed that funding would be given only for projects “aligned with European policy” such as on measures to fight climate change and boost digitalization.Abbott Test May Miss Many Cases (11:26 a.m. NY)The coronavirus test from Abbott Laboratories used at the White House and other prominent locations to get rapid answers on whether someone is infected may miss as many as half of positive cases, according to a report from New York University. The findings have yet to be confirmed.An analysis of Abbott’s ID NOW found it missed at least one-third of positive cases detected with a rival test and as many as 48% when using the currently recommended dry nasal swabs.Colombia Militarizes Brazil Border (11:20 a.m. NY)Colombia is increasing its military presence along the border with Brazil to head off the spread of new coronavirus cases as infections and deaths rise in Amazonas province, President Ivan Duque announced.Leticia, the capital of Amazonas, and which lies close to the border with Brazil and Peru has seen the number of confirmed cases increase including an outbreak in a prison. Brazil is fast emerging as the new global hotspot for the coronavirus pandemic, trailing only the U.S. in daily death tolls during some days.Air Travel to Lag for Years (11:02 a.m. NY)Demand for air travel will lag behind pre-virus forecasts by about 10% for at least five more years, according to the International Air Transport Association.Traffic next year will be down between a third and two-fifths from projections made prior to the pandemic, according to IATA, which doesn’t see travel recovering to last year’s levels until 2023 at the earliest. Brian Pearce, the trade group’s chief economist, said he expected a rebound in demand to come about two years after an upturn in GDP, partly due to the increased inconvenience of travel.Russian Wealth Fund Says Favipiravir Trial ‘Promising’ (9:47 a.m. NY)Russia’s sovereign wealth fund said clinical trials for an antiviral medicine it backs show it has potential to treat coronavirus patients.The Russian Direct Investment Fund’s joint venture with ChemRar group has been testing favipiravir at 18 clinics in Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod and Smolensk. Preliminary results are “promising,” indicating that 60% of people who receive the treatment test negative for Covid-19 on the fifth day, Chief Executive Officer Kirill Dmitriev said Wednesday.The fund is seeking to fast-track the drug’s approval in Russia. The country passed Spain with the second-most cases in the world Tuesday, and has averaged over 10,000 new diagnoses a day for the past 11 days. Confirmed cases rose by 10,028 over the past day to 242,271, but the pace of increase slowed to 4.3%.On Tuesday, President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman became the latest top official to test positive for the virus.U.S. to Get Sanofi Covid Vaccine First: CEO (9:11 a.m. NY)The U.S. was first in line to fund Sanofi’s vaccine research, Chief Executive Officer Paul Hudson said in an interview with Bloomberg News. He warned that Europe risks falling behind unless it steps up efforts to seek protection against the pandemic.“The U.S. government has the right to the largest pre-order because it’s invested in taking the risk,” Hudson said. The U.S., which expanded a vaccine partnership with the company in February, expects “that if we’ve helped you manufacture the doses at risk, we expect to get the doses first.”Powell Says Virus Poses Lasting Harm (9 a.m. NY)“The recovery may take some time to gather momentum, and the passage of time can turn liquidity problems into solvency problems,” Powell said Wednesday in remarks prepared for a virtual event hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery.”Powell pushed back against the prospect the central bank would deploy negative interest rates in the U.S., but didn’t fully rule out the option as a potential tool in the future.U.S. Sees Rapid Virus Growth in Tanzania (8:41 a.m. NY)The U.S. warned the virus is spreading rapidly in Tanzania, which has paused the release of official infection data, while Zambia closed its border to the country that serves as a key route for copper exports.Tanzanian President John Magufuli earlier this month questioned the reliability of test results from the national health laboratory and ordered an investigation, saying the outbreak isn’t as bad as the results suggest. The government hasn’t released an update since April 29.Vatican Braces for Belt-Tightening (8:36 a.m. NY)The Vatican is not at risk of default, but faces “difficult years” as the coronavirus dries up donations and other contributions, said the head of its Secretariat for the Economy, Father Juan Antonio Guerrero Alves.Revenue is expected to fall between 25% and 45% this year, Guerrero told official website Vatican News on Wednesday. In recent years, the Vatican has run a deficit of 60 million euros to 70 million euros as spending outran the roughly 270 million euros it receives from individual Catholics and national churches around the world, he said.Mexico to Start Reopening Economy on May 18 (8:32 a.m. NY)Mexico’s auto production, construction and mining will resume activities on May 18, Economy Minister Graciela Marquez said during a press conference on Wednesday. Marquez said close to 300 municipalities that have no virus cases will reopen starting on that date, and those with higher cases will restart at the start of June.Belgium to Permit Wedding Guests (8:15 a.m. NY)Belgium will gradually lift restrictions over the coming weeks, Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes said on Wednesday after a meeting of the Belgian National Security Council. In Phase 2, starting Monday, museums and some other cultural institutions will be allowed to open, if they restrict access via an online or phone-ticketing service.Hairdressers and similar services can resume if certain rules are respected. From the same date, up to 30 guests will be allowed to attend a wedding or funeral.Belgium reported 202 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, down from 330 the prior day and the fewest since mid-March. An additional 82 fatalities brought the death toll in the country of 11.4 million to 8,843.U.K. Easing Plans May Raise Risks for Chronic Patients (8:11 a.m. NY)Plans to get people back to work may put about 2.7 million young and middle-aged U.K. adults at higher risk of dying from Covid-19 because of common chronic conditions, according to a study.More people under the age of 70 with underlying diseases are likely to die, but how many of them do depends on the extent of society’s reopening, according to the study published in the Lancet journal. U.K. deaths above the expected baseline could be from about 18,000 to a worst case of almost 600,000 in a single year, depending on the rate of spread and the virus’s impact on health and care, according to researchers from University College London.Coronavirus in Kids Is Not Benign, Gottlieb Says (7:35 a.m. NY)“This condition that kids seem to be getting seems very concerning,” former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told NBC. “There was a perception that coronavirus was a largely benign affair in children. That’s not the case.”He said he was “surprised” CDC isn’t putting out more information about the virus in the U.S. Several states have said Gottlieb was helping to advise them on their approach to reopening and Gottlieb was named by President Donald Trump in April as someone providing guidance on economic revival to the White House.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gilead-opens-treatment-generics-china-015236933.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-05	2020-05-05 12:09:00	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	FDA: Antibody test makers must seek EUA, noting 'unscrupulous actors'	The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Monday changed its emergency-use policy for antibody tests, saying that manufacturers now have to seek regulatory authorization. The tests identify COVID-19 antibodies, which indicate a past infection with the novel coronavirus and are believed to provide some level of immunity to future infections; some experts say that widespread antibody testing is needed to reopen the economy. The FDA had announced on March 16 that antibody tests could be performed in some labs without an emergency use authorization (EUA), which is a type of regulatory OK granted during the pandemic. It is not an FDA approval. The makers of more than 200 tests have sought an EUA, and at least 12 have been granted one, including Abbott Laboratories Inc.  and Roche Holding AG . But concerns about the quality and marketing claims for some tests that have not received an EUA created concern at the FDA. &quot;The careful balancing of risks and benefits has shifted from where it was in mid-March,&quot; the regulator said. Test developers must now submit an EUA request with validation data within 10 days of an FDA notification, and these developers will follow a different submission template than the labs that are also developing antibody tests for authorization. &quot;Flexibility never meant we would allow fraud,&quot; the FDA said Monday. &quot;We, unfortunately, see unscrupulous actors marketing fraudulent test kits and using the pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of Americans' anxiety.&quot; This includes claiming the tests are FDA approved or authorized, that they can be conducted at home, or can be used to diagnose COVID-19, according to the FDA. The regulator noted that all forms of antibody tests can produce false results, based on their &quot;inherent limitations,&quot; and in some cases at least two antibody tests may need to be performed for one patient.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/442f6243-90e9-31d7-b89b-f49913321a7a/fda%3A-antibody-test-makers.html?.tsrc=rss

Another 250,000 are expected next week, the governor said.Newsom is aiming to sharply increase testing for the virus as a step toward reopening the world’s fifth-largest economy. California currently has capacity to test 16,000 people a day and expects to reach 25,000 by the end of the month, with an ultimate goal of 60,000 to 80,000, he said at a press briefing.The state plans to add 86 new testing sites, with a focus on rural and low-income communities. Abbott Laboratories has agreed to provide about 1.5 million serological tests, Newsom said. California also wants to expand contact tracing, and is seeking “an army” of 10,000 volunteers to help in that effort, including retrained state workers.The state, working with its regional partners in Washington and Oregon, plans to resume some scheduled surgeries, Newsom said. He has no date yet for a reopening of business.Harvard Won’t Take Stimulus Money (4:45 p.m. NY)Harvard University, the richest U.S. college, said it won’t accept federal stimulus funds after a barrage of criticism, including from President Donald Trump.The U.S. government’s $2 trillion stimulus to combat the effects of coronavirus lockdowns across the country provided about $12.5 billion in direct aid for all colleges. Distribution of the funds was determined by a formula that meant some of the wealthiest schools were eligible for millions of dollars in aid.Harvard said Wednesday it didn’t apply for the support, nor has it requested, received or accessed the funds.Official Ousted for Questioning Trump-Touted Drug: NYT (4:30 p.m. NY)Rick Bright, who left his role as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, was removed from the job after he pressed for more rigorous scientific scrutiny of hydroxychloroquine, a drug that has been touted as a potential Covid-19 treatment by President Donald Trump, the New York Times reported.“I believe this transfer was in response to my insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the Covid-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit,” he told the Times.BARDA is an integral part of the federal government’s efforts to contain the pandemic and find ways to prevent future outbreaks. The agency has been working to support clinical trials of vaccines under development by a number of pharmaceutical companies.Bright was moved into a smaller role at the National Institutes of Health where he will work on developing diagnostic tests for the coronavirus.U.S. Confirmed Cases Rise 3.1% (4 p.m. NY)U.S. cases rose 3.1% from the day before to 835,316, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. That was lower than Tuesday’s growth rate of 5.7% and below the average daily increase of 4.4% over the past week.Arkansas had the largest daily increase, rising 14%, to 2,262, according to data from Bloomberg and Johns Hopkins.New York, the center of the U.S. outbreak, reported an additional 5,526 cases, for a total of 257,216, according to Governor Andrew Cuomo. Downstate New York is now on the descent of the curve.Florida reported 28,309 cases, up 2.96% from a day earlier, Governor Ron DeSantis said. Deaths among Florida residents reached 893, an increase of 6.44%.Texas reported 873 new cases, up from 738 yesterday, according to state health department data. Deaths rose at the same pace, bringing the fatality total to 543 statewide.California’s deaths increased 6.8% from Tuesday to 86, Governor Gavin Newsom said at his daily press briefing. But other trends showed signs of improving, with hospitalizations falling 0.2% and intensive-care patients declining 1.8%.Almost 90% of Patients on Ventilators Died (3:13 p.m. NY)A study that examined outcomes for more than 2,600 patients found an extraordinarily high 88% death rate among Covid-19 patients in the New York City area who had to be placed on mechanical devices to help them breathe.The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, is one of the largest reviews published to date of Covid-19 patients hospitalized in the U.S. Overall, the researchers reported that 553 patients died, or 21%. bout 12% of the patients were sick enough to need ventilators.Spain Extends State of Emergency (2:52 p.m. NY)Spain’s parliament backed Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s request to extend a state of emergency to May 9, as the country tries to rein in the world’s second-most extensive coronavirus outbreak.The conservative People’s Party, the main opposition group, voted in favor of prolonging the measure for a third time, giving Sanchez’s Socialists enough support. The prime minister needs emergency powers to keep a lockdown in place and to exert full control over the country’s health system.Spain reported a small increase in the number of new cases and deaths Wednesday, and overall the latest numbers are steady. More than 20,000 people have died from the disease, while some 86,000 have recovered.EU’s Borrell Says U.S. Wrong to Deny Iran IMF Aid (2:18 p.m. NY)European Union foreign-policy chief Josep Borrell criticized the U.S. for blocking International Monetary Fund aid for Iran to fight the coronavirus, saying Tehran’s request for a $5 billion emergency IMF loan is justified on humanitarian grounds.“I really regret that the Americans -- that the United States -- are opposing the International Monetary Fund to take this decision,” Borrell told reporters in Brussels after chairing a video conference of foreign ministers from the 27-nation EU.Protests Could Fuel Outbreak, WHO Warns (1:30 p.m. NY)The head of the World Health Organization said protests could exacerbate the coronavirus crisis.“Protests and gatherings in the middle of the pandemic will not help,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a briefing in Geneva. “It will only fuel the outbreak.”Government leaders need to win the trust of citizens and engage with them in a two-way dialogue to manage social pressures, he said. His comments follow protests against government-mandated lockdowns in several U.S. states.Tedros also said he hopes the U.S. will reconsider the freeze on its financing, which also supports polio eradication and immunization of children. He said he has no extra energy to focus on anything but saving lives.Reported cases are trending upward in Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe, even though the numbers are low, Tedros said. Covid-19 appears to be stable or declining in most countries in Western Europe, Tedros said.Lockdowns can be less severe if countries have strong testing programs and quarantine everyone who is infected, said Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s health emergencies program. However, the risk of a resurgence is real because most people haven’t been infected, WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said.Irish Cases on Rise (12:50 p.m. NY)Ireland reported 631 new coronavirus cases, the highest since April 15, with 49 more deaths. The spike in cases comes after declining for three days straight. The country now has 16,671 confirmed cases, with 769 deaths.Pelosi Urges State Aid (12:40 p.m. NY)House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a “major package” of aid for state and local governments will be in the next stimulus legislation considered by Congress, setting up a conflict with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is urging a slowdown in doling out federal help.The $484 billion aid plan set for passage by the House on Thursday is an “interim” step to mitigate some of the economic damage wrought by the pandemic, Pelosi said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television.“Now we have to go further to help state and local” governments, she said, without putting a price tag on the aid.Although Trump said Tuesday he favored aid for states, McConnell has said any aid to states and municipalities should be reviewed carefully and that states should be allowed to declare bankruptcy.Italy Cases On Rise Again (12:15 p.m. NY)Italy registered its highest number of new coronavirus cases in four days on Wednesday as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte prepares a stimulus package for an economy paralyzed by a nationwide lockdown.The country also posted a record figure for recoveries from the disease, with 2,943 over the past 24 hours.Figures from civil protection authorities show there were 3,370 new cases for the 24-hour period, compared with 2,729 a day earlier. Confirmed cases now total 187,327. Italy, the original European epicenter of the outbreak, registered 437 deaths linked to the virus on Wednesday, compared with 534 the day before. That brings total fatalities to 25,085.Florida Cases Rise Almost 3% (12:06 p.m. NY)Florida reported 28,309 Covid-19 cases Wednesday morning, up 2.96% from a day earlier. Deaths among Florida residents reached 893, an increase of 6.44%.As cases in Florida show some signs of slowing in recent days, Governor Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that the state has flattened the curve and the predictions that Florida’s hospital system would be overwhelmed were incorrect.NYC Mayor to Isolate Anyone With Virus (12:01 p.m. NY)New York City officials intend to enlist thousands of health-care workers next month to conduct hundreds of thousands of diagnostic tests a day, and isolating anyone found to be carrying the disease.The plan, which hinges on the city’s still-unmet capacity to test residents, will require training thousands of “disease detectives” to interview each individual found positive for the virus, Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a news briefing Wednesday. The city would then trace his or her social contacts to test and isolate them if necessary.De Blasio’s goal is far more ambitious than what New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Tuesday of 40,000 a day for the entire state.The city will rent thousands of hotel rooms for virus carriers with no or mild symptoms who live in crowded households that make isolation impossible, de Blasio said.Large IPOs May Be Held Until July (11:38 a.m. NY)It may be three more months before the stock market is ready for large initial public offerings again, according to Nasdaq Inc. Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman.CEOs who were considering IPOs “are now waiting to see what the effects of the virus are later in the year,” Friedman said Wednesday in a Bloomberg Television interview. “I would say that companies that are not particularly impacted by the virus will look to try to get out in early Q3.”Those more affected will probably have to wait longer before attempting an IPO, Friedman said. Only three companies have gone public in the U.S. since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic, and two of them were in the biotechnology industry: Zentalis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Keros Therapeutics Inc.Prisoners Could Add 100,000 to Death Toll: ACLU (10:55 a.m. NY)The Trump administration’s projection for U.S. deaths from the coronavirus pandemic may be short by about 100,000 because it isn’t fully accounting for the nation’s high prison population, the American Civil Liberties Union said.Models that properly account for the roughly 740,000 people in jail in the U.S. on any given day suggest the country will experience “much higher death rates” than currently projected if inmate populations aren’t reduced rapidly, the organization said in a statement about its findings on Wednesday.Mnuchin Sees Economy Reopened by Late Summer (10:15 a.m. NY)Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he anticipates most of the U.S. economy will restart by the end of August after the coronavirus has led to social distancing measures that have shuttered many businesses.“We’re operating under the environment that we are going to open up parts of the economy and we’re looking forward to -- by the time we get later in the summer -- having most of the economy, if not all of the economy, open,” he said on Fox Business Network.Analysis Suggests 5.5% of Geneva Exposed (10:03 a.m. NY)An antibody analysis by the Geneva University Hospitals suggests that 5.5% of Geneva’s population -- some 27,000 people -- were exposed to Covid-19 as of April 17. The estimate was based on blood tests from a representative sample of 760 individuals.

2020-04-22	2020-04-22 18:48:07	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbot Laboratories: COVID-19 Tests Will Drive Further Growth, 5-Star Analyst Raises Price Target	Unlike other smaller healthcare companies, powerhouse Abbott Laboratories (ABT) hardly needed a global pandemic to raise awareness. The healthcare giant was performing well before the viral outbreak, but a slew of good news has just pushed its share price up to a new all-time high of $100.The company released its quarterly results last Thursday, delivering solid beats across the board. Specifically, revenue came in at $7.7 billion, indicating organic growth of 4.3%, while EPS hit $0.65, 4 cents above the estimates and exhibiting growth of 3.2%. On account of the economic uncertainties due to COVID-19, the company suspended guidance for 2020.The positive print isn’t much of a surprise. Over the last five years, Abbot has beaten top and bottom-line expectations in most quarters.But according to Credit Suisse’s Matt Miksic, the real good news was in the details.“Perhaps the most significant takeaways from Q1 results and management commentary related to the substantial increase in volumes and growth in new COVID-19 tests,” the 5-star analyst said, adding, “We view this wave of new tests as a significant new growth driver for ABT over the next 2-3 years, and expect consensus estimates and growth expectations to rise accordingly in the coming months.”Over the past several weeks, Abbot has launched three approved COVID-19 tests; two molecular tests on the company’s ID NOW point-of-care platform and m2000 lab-based platform and a lab-based serology blood test. The company expects to add two more in the coming weeks; a lateral flow serological test and an additional lab-based serology test.“We estimate this wave of COVID-19 tests could reach annual volumes in 2021 of ~50 mil for molecular and ~550 mil serological, driving significant incremental Diagnostics sales of $2.7 bil and 85c to sales and EPS for 2021, respectively, and continued growth in 2022,” Miksic noted.Accordingly, the top analyst reiterated an Outperform on Abbot along with raising the price target – bumped up from $95 to $106. Upside from current levels is 10%. (To watch Miksic’s track record, click here)All in all, the rest of the analyst community backs up Miksic’s call. A strong Buy consensus rating is based on 9 Buys and 3 Holds. At $103.85, the average price target implies upside of 9% in the year ahead.

2020-04-20	2020-04-20 17:40:44	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Medtech Climbs While JPMorgan Warns Fear May Slow Recovery	(Bloomberg) -- Expectations for a quick recovery in elective medical procedures may be misplaced as many patients may remain afraid to go to the doctor, JPMorgan analysts warned even as companies tied to those procedures rose on Monday.It’s a given that 2020 will be painful for the medical technology sector, but estimates for next year are also too high, and JPMorgan analysts led by Robbie Marcus predict a slow recovery from Covid-19 “until at least a vaccine/cure is discovered.”“The fear factor is real and will have an impact on patients’ willingness to undergo procedures,” the analysts said, with the elderly especially likely to continue avoiding doctor’s offices and health care even beyond this year. “If 2021+ forecasts continue to move lower and the pain appears to be more durable than immediate, we’d expect multiples to contract and stock prices to decline,” the bank said in a client note laying out the bear case for the sector.“Even once hospitals return to normal, the hospital system simply doesn’t have the capacity in terms of beds or manpower to meaningfully increase its caseload, with a growing backlog likely coupled with increased waiting times.”The health-care system will face lower demand and less ability to supply treatments as fewer, elective procedures, which are more profitable, lead to sector job cuts during the shutdown. Hospitals, already operating on razor-thin margins, may further cut their spending on new equipment and procedures over the next few years.The companies that rely less on elective procedures or hospital budgets,such as Baxter International Inc., Abbott Laboratories and Becton Dickinson and Co., will fare best among large caps, while among smaller companies Penumbra Inc., IRhythm Technologies Inc. and diabetes device makers Insulet Corp. and Tandem Diabetes Care Inc. will also be more insulated, according to the bank’s analysis.Abbott rose 4.1% to a record and was one of the top gainers as a benchmark of the sector rose to the highest since Feb. 25, before Covid-19 fears started to eat away at U.S. stock market confidence.Investors may be more optimistic on a recovery after reports over the weekend that Texas became one of the first states to resume elective procedures. Earlier today, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state would make an announcement regarding its policy on when those surgeries could restart.Baxter International Inc. climbed as much as 2.3% to touch an intraday record. Wells Fargo raised the company’s price target, citing an increased need for Baxter’s kidney treatments from a Covid-19-linked increase in kidney failure.Although JPMorgan says medical technology “will return to its former glory over time,” the bank also predicts that after the virus subsides, investors might see an increase in the “healthy cadence of value creating M&A” as acquirers snap up distressed companies on the cheap. “Investors with a longer-time horizon (3-5 years) are likely to find today’s valuations somewhat more attractive because of this longer-term outlook, but the next 12-24 months will likely be a bumpy road to get there.”(Adds shares, details on procedures in New York, Texas)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtech-climbs-while-jpmorgan-warns-174044967.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-17	2020-04-17 15:03:57	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Steer Clear of Co-Diagnostics Stock and Its Multitude of Red Flags	After developing a novel coronavirus test in lightning speed, Co-Diagnostics' (NASDAQ:CODX) stock soared to the stratosphere. The shares of the previously little-known company surged from less than $1 at the end of 2019 to a high of nearly $22 at the beginning of March.Source: Shutterstock But since then, for good reason, the stock has lost over 50% of its value. It looks like some investors have become aware of the many red flags that the company is presenting.Specifically, the company is facing clearly superior competition, and there's a chance that its tests could be defective. Further, Co-Diagnostics has not partnered with a major company on the test and seems to have only one major American customer for it.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Superior Competition and Potential DefectsAt least two coronavirus tests are much faster than Co-Diagnostics' offering, which reportedly yields results in &quot;less than two hours.&quot; Specifically, Cepheid, a unit of the conglomerate Danaher (NYSE:DHR), unveiled a test that renders a verdict in 45 minutes. Another test developed by medical device giant Abbott  Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) provides results &quot;in as little as five minutes.&quot;And from a convenience and health standpoint, a test recently developed by Rutgers University and two companies appears to take the cake. Specifically, the university's test uses saliva to determine whether patients have the virus. That is more comfortable than the mechanism used by other tests, which typically involve inserting swab into the noses or throats of the people being tested.More importantly, Rutgers' test minimizes contact between healthcare professionals and those being tested, reducing the chances that the professionals will become infected. In fact, it appears that, with Rutgers' tool, people can self-administer the test without any assistance from healthcare professionals.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy For Portfolio Strength In Uncertain Times Co-Diagnostics' test is reportedly less expensive than competing tests. And according to the company, it can be administered more quickly than other diagnostic tools.But in this case, I think the speed at which results can be reported and the safety of healthcare professionals are much more important than the cost of the test. Further, since the test developed by Rutgers eliminates the need for healthcare professionals to be involved with the testing process, it is probably cheaper overall than Co-Diagnostics' offering.Co-Diagnostics developed its test in just one week. Further, the company said that it bypassed the &quot;trial-and-error&quot; process that's usually incorporated into the development of such tests. And before this year, the company's revenue was meaningfully below $100,000 per year, indicating that its previous products were neither widely deployed nor highly reputable.It's true that the Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency approval to the company's test. But after the CDC used a faulty test for weeks at the outset of the coronavirus crisis in the U.S., I wouldn't bet a lot of money on the American government's ability to quickly and accurately evaluate tests for the virus. Cumulatively, these points make me think that those who believe that the test may not be accurate could be correct. Other Red FlagsCo-Diagnostics hired a private company called Promega to manufacture the test. Promega is an American company that has been in existence for over 40 years, and it reportedly had nearly $450 million of revenue last year, so it does not appear to be a fly-by-night firm. Still, I would have felt better about Co-Diagnostics if it had partnered with a Fortune 1000 company on the test.Finally, although the company stated on March 5 that &quot;numerous requests have been received from US clinical laboratories for the Company's reagents,&quot; as far as I can tell, it has not named any customers in the U.S. outside of its home state of Utah. The Bottom Line on CODX StockDespite its recent pullback, the stock is still up about 1,000% in 2020 solely on the basis of its coronavirus test. But the company is facing a great deal of tough competition in that area, and it has multiple red flags. As a consequence, I recommend that investors take their profits on the stock at this point.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 13 years.

2020-04-16	2020-04-16 12:30:23	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	A Crisis Shows the Value of Big Government and Big Business	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Americans tend to like their institutions small. On the political right, many are distrustful of big government, preferring private initiatives, competitive markets and localism. On the left, there is deep suspicion of the power of large corporations. And Americans of all stripes tend to lionize individuals who take on the system -- the plucky entrepreneur who outmaneuvers hidebound industrial giants, the grassroots activists who force the system to change and so on. Economists who study the importance of institutions have all too often been brushed aside by those who are in love with markets.But the Covid-19 pandemic may give Americans a new appreciation for the importance of big organizations. Both big government and big business have the ability to mobilize resources on a vast scale that small upstarts or grassroots initiatives can never match. And both big government and big business possess deep reservoirs of human capital that would be far less effective in atomized form.Consider the crucial importance of government in fighting a pandemic. From the Centers for Disease Control’s failure regarding testing to the Food and Drug Administration’s perverse regulations, it has become clear that a competent, well-staffed, efficient bureaucracy is key to a nation’s ability to meet major threats. The slow erosion of the civil service -- championed by right-wing activists for whom government is always the problem -- may be coming back to bite the country in its time of need.The CDC and the FDA aren’t typically targets in the nation's political crossfire and they aren’t the kind of participatory democracy that the U.S. traditional celebrates. They are gray, stolid, un-sexy institutions full of dedicated, unelected lifetime bureaucrats. But they are absolutely essential to the nation.Meanwhile, the pandemic may make Americans yearn for more big government institutions. The enormous relief program could be the precursor of a big government push to fight climate change. And the need for universal free coronavirus testing and treatment will probably strengthen the case for a national health-insurance system.But at the same time, coronavirus might increase Americans’ confidence in another much-maligned institution: big business.Pharmaceutical and biotech companies are now scrambling to develop treatments and vaccines. Household names such as Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline are on the front line of the fight, along with exotic-sounding companies such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Gilead Sciences,  large companies in their own right that have existed for decades. All have vast reservoirs of scientific expertise, huge libraries of data, enormous expensive laboratories and expertise in navigating complex regulatory processes.Coronavirus testing, too, has depended crucially on corporate efficiency and scale. It was only when big  companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Roche and Thermo Fisher Scientific got FDA approval to manufacture and distribute tests in mid-March that the U.S. stopped being an international laggard on this front.Supplies such as personal-protection equipment for medical workers are also crucial. In late March, shortages of these materials held back testing, partly because supply chains for some of these materials had been offshored before the crisis. Some Americans have made valiant efforts to produce masks via Dunkirk-style ad-hoc projects, but these will never meet the demand. In recent weeks, large companies such as Ford, General Motors and 3M have been retooling their vast production lines to make essential items such as face shields, as well as ventilators for the severely ill.And as my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Tyler Cowen points out, big businesses have also proven essential in allowing Americans to carry on some semblance of their daily lives in the face of widespread business shutdowns. Amazon.com and other e-commerce companies have given millions of Americans a way to get household necessities and medical supplies without going outside and risking exposure to the virus. Their huge logistics and warehousing systems have been strained to the utmost by the pandemic, but deliveries continue. Meanwhile, food-delivery companies and online grocery-shopping services such as Instacart are helping Americans stay in their homes.In other words, Americans are being forcefully reminded of the importance and the vast capabilities of big institutions. From the CDC’s expert epidemiologists and data-collection resources to Amazon’s logistics systems and Johnson & Johnson’s labs, big bureaucracies and big companies have irreplaceable reservoirs of knowledge and effectiveness that startups, small businesses, independent individuals, activists and grassroots projects utterly lack.These institutions can’t simply be slapped together when the need arises; they must be nurtured and built up over decades. Often, that process is decidedly unromantic. Regulatory agencies can overstep their bounds, big businesses can hurt people for profit. All such abuses need to be curbed and big institutions do require constant monitoring. But they must not be smashed, or the nation will find itself lost and flailing in the next crisis.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Noah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Sales in its diagnostics unit fell nearly 1% to $1.83 billion as increased use of its tests for the fast-spreading virus failed to offset a decline in demand for its other diagnostic tests.  The results were driven by softer-than-expected negative impact across businesses from COVID-19, said J.P.

The company had net earnings of $564 million, or 31 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2020, compared with $672 million, or 38 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were 65 cents, against a FactSet consensus of 59 cents. Revenue was $7.7 billion for the quarter, up 2.5% from $7.5 billion in the first quarter of 2019, against a FactSet consensus of $7.4 billion. Sales in its nutrition and medical devices businesses increased, by 6.3% to $1.9 billion in nutrition (driven in part by increased consumer purchases of pediatric nutrition products in advance of shelter-in-place orders in the U.S.) and by 1.4% to $2.9 billion in devices (due to fewer sales of cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices in hospitals where those procedures slowed or were put on hold). Sales of diagnostics fell 0.8% to $1.8 billion as the unit reported lower routine testing volume as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company suspended its guidance for 2020, citing &quot;uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.&quot; Year-to-date, Abbott's stock is up 4.7%.

2020-04-16	2020-04-16 09:20:08	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbot Labs Rolls Out Coronavirus Antibody Test, Seeks to Produce 20 Million Tests by June	Abbott Laboratories (ABT) said it is rolling out a laboratory-based blood test which can detect antibodies designed to identify whether someone has had the coronavirus strain Covid-19. The digital device maker is planning to ramp up manufacturing to produce 20 million tests by June.Shares of the healthcare company, which is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on Thursday, rose 2% to $90.94 a share, while the NYSE Composite Index dropped 2.9%. Analysts expect Abbott to earn an average 58 cents per share in the quarter.The company announced that it expects to ship close to 1 million tests this week to hospitals and labs in the U.S, and will ship a total of 4 million tests in April. By June and beyond, Abbott will be shipping 20 million tests to the U.S. per month, according to the report.The digital device maker’s third  Covid-19 test, or IgG antibody test, is different than diagnostic tests. While molecular testing detects whether someone has the virus, antibody tests determine if someone was previously infected.The SARS-CoV-2 IgG test identifies the IgG antibody, which is a protein that the body produces in the late stages of infection and may remain for up to months and possibly years after a person has recovered, the company said. The antibody test will initially run on Abbot’s Architect i1000SR and i2000SR laboratory instruments used in U.S. hospitals and labs. These instruments can conduct up to 100-200 tests per hour.In the fight against COVID-19, Abbott’s tests to identify the virus have helped healthcare providers make significant headway.  As a result, five-star analyst Matt Miksic at Credit Suisse kept a Buy call on the stock and raised the price target to $95 price target from $94.Turning to other Wall Street analysts, the bulls have it. With 8 Buy ratings and 3 Holds assigned in the last three months, the consensus rating comes in as a Moderate Buy. The $95.50 average price target implies 5% upside potential in the coming 12 months. (See Abbott stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Moderna Hosts Virtual Vaccines Day; Four Analysts Reiterate Bullish Calls  Arcus Surges 50% In After-Hours Trading On Rumored Gilead Stake  Goldman Sachs Profit Plummets 49% as Loan-Loss Provisions Balloon   More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Goldman Sachs: 2 S&P; 500 Stocks to Buy (And 1 to Avoid)   * Apple Rolls Out ‘Affordable’ iPhone During Global Coronavirus Pandemic   * Nvidia Receives Chinese Approval For Long-Awaited Mellanox Deal   * Aurora Cannabis (ACB): Not All Reverse Splits Are Negative	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbot-labs-rolls-coronavirus-antibody-092008583.html?.tsrc=rss

Those who have the antibodies will be allowed to return to work earliest, because they no longer carry the virus and have developed resistance to it.New York has asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to expedite approval of an antibody test that could test as many as 100,000 New Yorkers a day, Cuomo said.Merkel Allows Smaller German Shops to Reopen (1:40 p.m. NY)German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced tentative steps to slowly start returning the country to normal, allowing some smaller shops to reopen next week and schools to gradually restart in early May.Most of the restrictive measures will remain in place through May 3 and many aspects of public life will be limited for months to come.

The device has become critical to treat Covid-19 patients.Belgium Extends Lockdown (12:40 p.m. NY)Belgium extended restrictions on its citizens and businesses until May 3, as Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes warned that any loosening of the measures will be very gradual and that nobody can say today when normal life can resume. Mass events such as summer music festivals will be banned until the end of August.The only easing of restrictions, now entering their fifth week, are for home improvement stores, which will be allowed to re-open and elderly in nursing homes can receive single-person visits on strict conditions again. A decision on school re-openings hasn’t been taken.German Lockdown Extended (12:35 p.m. NY)Germany agreed to extend most restrictions on public life into next month while allowing small shops to reopen, underlining the struggle for European governments to balance reactivating slumping economies against fears of a resurgence of the coronavirus.Chancellor Angela Merkel prolonged measures designed to limit the spread of the disease until May 3 after talks Wednesday with the premiers from the country’s 16 states. The leaders also agreed on a reopening of smaller retailers next week as well as gradually reopening school starting with graduating classes early next month.“We have made some progress,” Merkel said. “But I do have to stress that this progress is fragile.”New Italian Cases Drop (12:30 p.m. NY)Italy reported its fewest new coronavirus cases in four and a half weeks as a nationwide lockdown begins to check the spread of the disease.

But for now our focus, my focus, is on stopping this virus and saving lives,” Tedros said.Luxembourg Schools Reopen in May (11:53 a.m. NY)Luxembourg will start a “very prudent” step-by-step relaxation of strict confinement measures next week as the number of new infections is gradually going back, the nation’s premier Xavier Bettel said at a press conference Wednesday.Wearing a mask or an alternative mouth protection in public will be mandatory as of April 20, if a two meter distance is not possible, he said.

The only major sector of the city economy likely to avoid job losses over the next year is health care.Coronavirus Infections Reach 2 Million (10:10 a.m. NY)The new coronavirus has infected 2 million people around the world, a grim milestone exposing the difficulty of trying to contain the deadly pathogen.What began as a mysterious pneumonia-like illness in Wuhan, China, late last year has morphed into a global health crisis that has threatened health systems and economies alike.It took about four months for the virus to infect 1 million people and only 12 days for that number to double. The total case count today is likely even higher than 2 million, with countries including the U.S. testing only a fraction of their populations.Greece Extends Flight Ban (9:33 a.m. NY)Greece is extending a temporary ban on all flights to and from Italy, Spain, Turkey, the U.K. and the Netherlands by a month to May 15 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the country’s civil aviation authority said.

The business took an almost $900 million hit that contributed to a 46% decline in profit, even as it included gains from pending private-equity sales. A strong showing in the trading operations, the firm’s biggest division, helped counter the damage as market volatility boosted demand for trading services.Japan Considering $930 Cash Handouts (7:39 a.m. NY)Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s coalition ally, Natsuo Yamaguchi of the Komeito party, proposed making the 100,000 yen payments across the board, without income limits, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Wednesday. Japan has so far promised larger payments of 300,000 yen ($2,800), but limited them to those who can prove a substantial loss of income.BofA Joins Rival Banks in Setting Aside Billions for Loan Losses (6:57 a.m. NY)Bank of America Corp. joined rivals in setting aside billions of dollars for loans likely to sour amid an almost total U.S. economic shutdown. Profit plunged 45% as the company allocated $4.76 billion for loan losses, the most since 2010, as businesses and households reel from the coronavirus pandemic.The bank follows competitors JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., which posted their highest provisions in a decade Tuesday. Citigroup Inc. on Wednesday set aside $7.03 billion to cover potential losses on loans.Banks are trying to get ahead of loan losses they expect to come from the pandemic bringing large swaths of the global economy to a virtual standstill. While defaults haven’t yet spiked in a meaningful way, bank efforts to build up their reserves show they’re bracing for a severe recession.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-cut-funding-reopening-plans-223001680.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-05	2020-04-05 10:58:37	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	3 Coronavirus Stocks That Could Lead the Market to Recovery	Almost three months have passed since COVID-19 began its spread beyond China’s borders, and the market remains in free fall. Capping off another volatile week, stocks fell on Friday April 3 in response to disappointing U.S. economic data, offsetting gains posted in the previous session.  Based on a new report from the Labor Department, the U.S. economy saw 701,000 jobs erased in March, much more than economists originally expected as the figure doesn’t even include the 10 million unemployment filings that occurred after March 14.  In addition, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Friday that the state had experienced the biggest jump in COVID-19-related deaths the day before, sending the market plummeting even further. For those investors feeling hopeless right now, there’s a bright spot on the horizon. Several companies have stepped up to the plate, developing innovative solutions to fight off the deadly virus. According to some Wall Street pros, these new technologies represent a possible inflection point in the war against COVID-19, and could even help drive the stock market’s recovery. Taking all of this into consideration, we used TipRanks’ database to get more information on three stocks at the frontline of the COVID-19 battle. The investing platform revealed that all of these Buy-rated tickers have been flagged by some analysts for their technology’s huge potential. Let’s get started. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) In the fight against COVID-19, Abbott’s tests to identify the virus have helped healthcare providers make significant headway.  Along with its molecular test that is already being used in labs throughout the U.S., the company revealed on April 3 that the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for a rapid coronavirus testing system. As the product can detect positive results in five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes, much faster than any other available COVID-19 tests, Wall Street focus has locked in on ABT. Weighing in for Barclays, analyst Kristen Stewart believes the test will be performed on the ID NOW platform, an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology, and thus offers advantages that go beyond its speed.  “The system is easy to use with minimal training. The tests are CLIA waived, which is an advantage and allows for the placement in physician offices and urgent care offices. We estimate there are at least 15,000 systems in the United States, placed throughout physician offices, urgent care offices, and other healthcare facilities,” Stewart explained. As for the total opportunity, Stewart doesn’t dispute that Abbott’s manufacturing capacity, which she thinks would be the rate limiting factor as there is significant demand for the test, remains unclear. “The pricing would likely be under the non-CDC pricing ~$51 level, perhaps in the $35-$45 range. We hope Abbott would supply these details when it announces approval,” the analyst noted.  That being said, 4 million of its molecular tests can be conducted each month on its m2000 systems, with ABT charging about $30 per test. As a result, Stewart kept an Overweight call and $98 price target on the stock. Should this target be met, a twelve-month gain of 23% could be in the cards. (To watch Stewart’s track record, click here) Turning now to other Wall Street analysts, the bulls have it. With 8 Buy ratings and 3 Holds assigned in the last three months, the consensus rating comes in as a Moderate Buy. The $97.89 average price target implies only slightly less upside potential than Stewart’s forecast. (See Abbott stock analysis on TipRanks)Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Next up is a consumer goods and healthcare heavyweight, Johnson & Johnson, which is developing a vaccine against COVID-19. After the company identified a lead candidate, one analyst thinks JNJ is one of the names capable of fueling the stock market’s turnaround.  With a lead experimental vaccine candidate selected, Kristen Stewart, who also covers ABT, points out that at the latest, JNJ can kick off Phase 1 human clinical studies by September 2020. According to management, the first doses of the vaccine could be available under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in early 2021.  Adding to the good news, JNJ has significantly expanded its partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), with both entities pledging more than $1 billion to co-fund the vaccine’s development and clinical testing. If that wasn’t enough, Stewart notes “BARDA and JNJ have provided additional funding to allow expansion of ongoing work to identify anti-viral treatments against COVID-19.” However, while JNJ has ramped up the scaling of manufacturing capacity and has a target of supplying more than 1 billion vaccine doses, there is a risk that the candidate won’t eventually receive approval.  Having said that, Stewart argues the real goal is to develop an affordable vaccine “on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use.” She added, “Thus we would anticipate the cost it would charge for the vaccine would recoup the cost of development, cost of scaling up the manufacturing, and cost of production. Thus, we would not look at the vaccine as being a windfall or major positive from a financial perspective. We believe J&J is doing the right thing and adhering to the company’s long-running Credo.” Despite the fact that its medical device business could take a hit as elective procedures are delayed, its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, balanced portfolio, strong balance sheet and dividend, yielding 2.8% and paying out $3.80 per share annually, reaffirm Stewart’s confidence. Bearing this in mind, she maintained a Buy rating and $173 price target. This implies shares could surge 29% in the next year.  What does the rest of the Street have to say? Out of 9 recent reviews, 8 were bullish, making the consensus rating a Strong Buy. In addition, the $157.22 average price target brings the upside potential to 17%. (See Johnson & Johnson stock analysis on TipRanks)  Gilead Sciences (GILD) Biotech Gilead Sciences has grabbed headlines left and right thanks to its experimental COVID-19 treatment, remdesivir. With the company now stating it will donate 1.5 million doses of the drug, which could treat 140,000 patients, it’s no wonder some analysts are standing firmly behind GILD.  Shares are up 20% year-to-date, but Jeffries’ Michael Yee believes its growth story is still heating up. Looking at the big picture, he argues, “GILD remains a defensive positioning stock particularly in this macro environment. We appreciate short-term trading has been mostly dictated around market volatility risk-on/off and expectations on remdesivir for COVID-19 data starting in April.” That being said, there’s more to this biotech’s “improving story”. The company has placed a significant focus on expansion, with its recent M&A activity including a $5 billion deal with immuno-oncology company Forty Seven. Additionally, its second quarter Phase 3 filgotinib UC data readout could send shares on an upward trajectory as well as improve sentiment surrounding the drug’s differentiation from AbbVie.  Yee already thinks that the pbo-adjusted remission rates imply that filgotinib is “competitive with other UC drugs.” Expounding on this, he stated, “While we expect investors to make cross-trial comparisons, we caution comparing directly to other UC datasets is imprecise due to differing baseline characteristics such as proportion of biologic naive/experienced and slightly different endpoints of the Mayo score. However -- recent commentary from GILD suggests positive confidence around results and good activity in both biologic naive and experienced.” With an August PDUFA date for filgotinib in RA, Yee does, however, acknowledge that a class label Black Box could be given as a result of uncertainty related to degree of bleeding difference between various JAK drugs. It’s also still unclear if filgotinib will be approved at the 200mg dose.  Commenting on the second issue, Yee said, “In any case, it's reasonable to approve 200mg particularly if the MANTA interim look is OK but FDA is a conservative bunch. Also, even if not, we point out ABBV was only approved at the low dose in RA as well so it would not be a totally critical issue.” To this end, Yee reiterated a Buy recommendation and $89 price target, indicating 14% upside potential. (To watch Yee’s track record, click here)   Looking at the consensus breakdown, 10 Buys, 9 Holds and 2 Sells add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $76.88, the average price target puts the downside potential at 2%.

It also said there had been three more deaths.Queen to Address Britain (8 a.m. HK)Queen Elizabeth will strike an optimistic note about the U.K.’s collective response to the coronavirus in a special broadcast Sunday to the U.K. and Commonwealth nations, according to excerpts reported by the BBC and the Guardian. Other than her annual Christmas address, the monarch rarely makes public pronouncements of this kind.U.S. Warned of ‘Deadly Period’ (6:50 p.m. NY)President Donald Trump offered a stark warning about the days ahead as his top medical adviser said cases in hard-hit cities like New York, Detroit and New Orleans will likely reach a peak within a week.“There’s going to be a very, very deadly period, unfortunately,” Trump said at the White House on Saturday. “It’s not going to be a good-looking situation.” Trump compared the casualties to a world war, without giving specific estimates.Deborah Birx, the U.S. State Department immunologist advising the White House on its response, warned that even if new cases slow, or fall, deaths will lag.“If mitigation in New York worked -- and we believe it is working -- cases are going to start to go down, but the mortality will lag,” she said. Administration officials have estimated as many as 240,000 could die.Gilead Donates Drug Doses (6:30 p.m. NY)Gilead Sciences Inc. donated 1.5 million doses of its experimental anti-coronavirus drug remdesivir, which could treat 140,000 patients, and will offer it for “compassionate use” by people with severe symptoms, Chief Executive Officer Daniel O’Day said in an open letter.The company is also boosting its supply of remdesivir to more than 500,000 treatment courses by October, and to more than 1 million by the end the year. Production time has also been accelerated to six months from one year, he said.Trump Backs Panel on Reopening (5:30 p.m. NY)President Donald Trump may form a panel to examine how best to restart the economy after limits to stem the spread of Covid-19 are lifted.“I’m thinking about it,” Trump said at the White House. “We have to open our country again. We don’t want to be doing this for months and months and months.”Dana Perino, former press secretary to President George W. Bush, suggested “a nonpartisan/bipartisan mix of experts” who could advise the president about overcoming the economic difficulties stemming from harsh measures suggested by the government.Trump Vows to Keep Gear in the U.S. (5:15 p.m. NY)President Donald Trump said he would use the Defense Production Act to retaliate when companies ship medical equipment elsewhere that’s needed in the U.S. to cope with the pandemic.“You could call it retaliations because that’s what it is -- it’s a retaliation if people don’t give us what we need for our people we’re going to be very tough,” Trump said.Trump has said he invoked the act to ban the export of supplies -- escalating a battle with allies and 3M Co. 3M has pushed back against a request to halt exports, saying the move would raise “significant” humanitarian concerns.Trump later said: “We’re very disappointed in 3M. They should be taking care of our country. They can sell to others but they should be taking care of our country.”Read the story here.California Seeks More Tests (3:46 p.m. NY)California has tested 126,700 residents so far, which Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday said was low.

Companies will be able to seek bank loans for as much as 25% of their revenue, and those new benefits could be combined with other measures the government is studying to help Italian businesses.Nigeria Plans Crisis Fund (2:45 p.m. NY)Nigeria’s finance minister asked the National Assembly to approve a 500 billion naira ($1.2 billion) Covid-19 crisis fund during a meeting Saturday with Senate President Ahmad Lawan and House Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila.Africa’s top oil producer will create the fund by taking money from various special government accounts, the minister told the lawmakers. Nigeria has 209 cases and four deaths, according to Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.Boris Johnson’s Fiancee Tweets on Virus (2:15 p.m. NY)Carrie Symonds, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s pregnant fiancee, tweeted that she “spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of coronavirus.” She said that she hasn’t “needed to be tested” and that after resting, she’s “on the mend.”The premier tested positive for Covid-19 more than a week ago.New York’s Deadliest Day (2 p.m. NY)New York, the worst-hit U.S. state, recorded the biggest daily death toll yet, adding 630 fatalities for a total of 3,565, Governor Andrew Cuomo said. One thousand ventilators are due to arrive from China on Saturday. “This is a big deal and it’s going to make a significant difference for us,” Cuomo said. Oregon donated another 140. “We’re not at the apex,” Cuomo told reporters. New York City’s total rose to 63,306 cases and 2,624 deaths.Read the full story here.Trudeau Plans Trump Call Amid Spat (1 p.m. NY)Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he will speak to Donald Trump soon as the U.S. president escalates a battle with allies and 3M Co. over exports of medical equipment and N95 masks. Trudeau said he wasn’t looking to retaliate or limit exports to the U.S. but will note that Canada also sends key equipment across the border.“In terms of gloves and other types of equipment and test kits, the fact is we’ve supplied that equipment to the United States,” Trudeau said at a news conference. It would hurt both countries to interrupt those supplies, Trudeau said.Read story here.Italy’s Daily Deaths Lowest Since March 26 (1:10 p.m. NY)Italy reported 681 coronavirus deaths on Saturday, including a police officer in Premier Giuseppe Conte’s security team. Authorities warned that a return to normalcy remains distant. The daily toll was the lowest since March 26 and fell from 766 on Friday, according to civil protection data. There were 4,805 new cases, an increase from 4,585 a day earlier.While efforts to contain the virus have started bearing fruit, “It’s way too early to think the battle is won,” according to emergency response czar Domenico Arcuri.Read the full story hereDubai Extends Restrictions to 24 Hours (1:05 p.m. NY)Dubai imposed further restrictions on the movement of people and halted metro services as the Middle East’s business hub seeks to limit the spread of the coronavirus.A program to clear the streets will be extended to 24 hours for two weeks from Saturday, Dubai’s media office said by tweet.

2020-04-02	2020-04-02 19:43:56	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Global Infections Top 1 Million; N.Y. Cases Rise: Virus Update	(Bloomberg) -- Spain reported 950 more coronavirus deaths, the most in a single day, taking total fatalities in the country to more than 10,000. New York added almost 9,000 cases.The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits more than doubled to a second straight record. In Britain, almost 1 million people claimed welfare payments in the past two weeks. Stocks gained as oil surged.Germany faces a deeper recession than during the financial crisis. British Airways furloughed 30,000 staff, cuts pay.Key Developments:BREAKING: Global cases top 1 million; deaths exceed 51,000: Johns HopkinsNations with mandatory TB vaccines show fewer coronavirus deathsLA urges city to mask up; NY, NJ deaths double in three daysLocked up, beaten and shamed: virus laws lead to abusePalantir’s new ‘driving thrust’: predicting virus outbreaksLife-or-death hospital decisions come with threat of lawsuitsGermany’s Deaths Top 1,000 (3:15 p.m. NY)Deaths in Germany climbed to 1,074 Thursday, a day after the government extended a nationwide lockdown beyond Easter. The toll was 931 the previous day, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Confirmed cases increased to 84,264 -- the third-highest in Europe -- from 77,981.The head of Germany’s public health authority said this week he expects the nation’s relatively low death rate of 0.8% to rise in the next few weeks.NYC Ambulance Response Slows (3 p.m. NY)New York City ambulances are taking almost three minutes longer than usual to respond to the most critical distress calls as administrative bottlenecks in emergency rooms cause delays, even as streets are uncharacteristically clear.Response times in March averaged 10 minutes and 7 seconds, according to New York City Fire Department records, compared with an average 7 minutes, 15 seconds in the same period a year earlier. Ambulances sometimes wait as long as an hour to deliver patients to an ER, said Anthony Almojera, an EMS technician and vice president of the fire department’s EMS Officers Union Local 3621.Sressed-out drivers and paramedics will get some help from 250 more ambulances and 500 specialists that the Federal Emergency Management Agency sent to the city this week.Portugal Shuts Airports (2:40 p.m. NY)Portugal’s airports will be closed April 9-13 as the nation deals with the outbreak during the Easter holiday period. The government also is limiting the number of passengers on flights to put distance between travelers, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said in Lisbon on Thursday.President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa earlier extended the state of emergency for two weeks through April 17. The number of confirmed cases in Portugal rose 9.5% to 9,034, slower than the two previous daily increases.U.S. Layoffs Lead to Lost Insurance (1:10 p.m. NY)Some 3.5 million American workers probably lost their employer-provided health insurance policies in the past two weeks as the epidemic triggered an unprecedented wave of layoffs, according to research published Thursday by the Economic Policy Institute.The “very rough estimate” is based on industry-specific unemployment claims filed in Washington state, which had the earliest U.S. outbreak.It’s hard to be precise because some laid-off workers will be able to get insurance via Obamacare exchanges or a family member who still has a job, or will qualify for government coverage under Medicaid, the EPI said. On the other hand, the 3.5 million doesn’t include spouses or children of the newly unemployed who may now be without coverage.N.Y. New Cases Rise Almost 9,000 (1 p.m. NY)New York’s coronavirus outbreak shows no signs of abating, with almost 8,700 new infections, 1,200 new hospitalizations, 400 new ICU admissions and more than 400 new deaths, Governor Andrew Cuomo said.Cuomo said at the current infection rate, the state is six days away from exhausting its stockpile of breathing machines. About 350 new patients per night need ventilation, and the state has about 2,200 stockpiled.Unlike other states that claim to have received faulty ventilators from the U.S. stockpile, Cuomo says all those received by New York appear to be in working order.British Airways Staff Furloughed (12:45 p.m. NY)British Airways, which grounded most of its fleet as travel demand slumped, will furlough about 28,000 employees and pay them 80% of their usual pay, the Unite union said Thursday after labor talks. The U.K. government will cover up to 2,500 pounds ($3,095) a month under a national plan, with the airline picking up wages beyond that level.The airline is following other carriers in furloughing workers as the virus wipes out global travel demand. Among U.K. rivals, EasyJet Plc laid off cabin crew for two months Monday after grounding its entire fleet, while staff at Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. have signed up for eight-week breaks, extended sabbaticals or voluntary severance.Netherlands Urges Quarantine for U.S. Travelers (12:40 p.m. NY)Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called on citizens returning to the Netherlands from the U.S. to self-quarantine for 14 days, press agency ANP reports.The same is being asked for all citizens who are being repatriated. Rutte also called on residents in neighboring Germany and Belgium to stay away in the long Easter weekend.Pence Says 100,000 Get Tested (12:34 p.m. NY)Vice President Mike Pence said more than 100,000 Americans are now being tested daily for coronavirus, as the government tries to ramp up its lagging response to tracking the outbreak.A weekend breakthrough on point-of-care testing by Abbott Laboratories will make an additional 50,000 tests available each day, Pence said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg Television.There have been about 1.2 million coronavirus tests performed in the U.S. as of noon Thursday, according to the Covid 19 Tracking Project, which examines data supplied by states.Italy Infections Slow (12:20 p.m. NY)Italy reported 4,668 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday compared with 4,782 a day earlier, as growth in infections slowed.The nation had 760 deaths as the number of fatalities rose again after three weeks of nationwide lockdown.The toll over the past 24 hours compared with 727 on Wednesday, according to figures from the civil protection agency.Remy Cointreau Takes Hit on China Sales (12:20 p.m. NY)Remy Cointreau SA, one of the world’s largest sellers of Cognac, cut its forecast for the fiscal year and said it expects profit to be down between 25% and 30%. Producers of the spirit are enduring a collapse in sales from China as a result of the coronavirus. The country had previously grown to become one of the most important sales markets for Cognac and other European luxury goods. Just under a third of Remy Cointreau’s revenue comes from Asia, with China being the largest market in the region.Democrats Postpone Convention (12:05 p.m. NY)The Democratic National Committee on Thursday postponed the presidential nominating convention from July to Aug. 17 due to concerns about the coronavirus, according to two people familiar with the decision. The delay comes after likely presidential nominee Joe Biden said it should be pushed back for safety reasons.Pelosi Forming Panel to Oversee Stimulus (11:35 a.m. NY)U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will create a select committee with subpoena power to oversee the government’s response to the outbreak, including how the $2.2 trillion from last week’s stimulus plan is spent.Pelosi on Thursday compared the committee to the panel chaired by then-Senator Harry Truman in the 1940s to investigate defense spending as the country mobilized for World War II.“We want to make sure there are not exploiters out there,” she told reporters. “Where there is money, there is mischief.”Putin Extends Lockdown Through April 30 (10:36 a.m. NY)President Vladimir Putin extended his order keeping Russians at home until April 30, warning that the spread of coronavirus has yet to reach its peak.The Russian leader said certain parts of Russia, including Moscow, haven’t managed to get the situation under control. He said he would give additional authority to regional leaders to determine the level of response locally. He noted that the stay-at-home period could be shortened if the situation improves.Russia has more than 3,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus after a 28% increase overnight.NYC Business Activity Falls (10:30 a.m. NY)A measure of business activity in the New York City area sank to the lowest level on record in March. The Institute for Supply Management-New York’s current business conditions index fell 39 points last month to 12.9, the lowest in data back to 1993 and well below its 27.1 reading duriing the global financial crisis. Levels below 50 signal contracting activity.Kenya to Hire Health Workers (10:15 a.m. NY)Kenya is set to hire 6,000 health workers to help fight the coronavirus outbreak, with 5,000 deployed to counties and 1,000 will remain at the national hospitals, Health Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said.Kenya has confirmed 110 Covid-19 cases and three deaths.Walgreens Flags Sales Downturn (9:43 a.m. NY)Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. executives said sales have started to decline at its drugstores as a result of the pandemic, though the full impact on its business won’t be known for months.U.S. consumers had raced early last month to stock up on drugs, cleaning supplies and toilet paper as they prepared to stay at home to avoid getting or spreading Covid-19. Now, that rush appears to be ebbing.Amazon Hires 80,000, Steps Up Warehouse Safety (9:24 a.m. NY)Amazon.com Inc. said it has hired 80,000 people to help meet demand for online orders and has stepped up safety precautions at its U.S warehouses.Dave Clark, Amazon’s logistics chief, said in a blog on Thursday that Amazon would probably go “well beyond” its previous estimate of an additional $350 million in costs to support a growing workforce.Germany Backs Use of Bailout Fund (9:15 a.m. NY)The government in Berlin says it’s ready to send an “unambiguous signal” to markets by letting countries tap the European Stability Mechanism, the euro area’s rescue fund, to help them deal with the fallout of the pandemic.That’s according to a position paper seen by Bloomberg, which also advocates setting up a 50 billion-euro fund to guarantee loans to small and medium-sized companies, especially in countries that don’t have their own development banks. Germany also said it would welcome a European unemployment reinsurance.U.S. Jobless Claims Doubled to Record Last Week: (8:38 a.m. NY)The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits more than doubled to a second straight record as the coronavirus widened its reach and closed more businesses.A total of 6.65 million people filed jobless claims in the week ended March 28, according to Labor Department figures released Thursday, as many stores and restaurants were forced to close across the nation to mitigate the outbreak.U.K.’s Johnson Still Has Mild Symptoms (8:24 a.m. NY)U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson continues to show mild symptoms after contracting Covid-19, his spokesman, James Slack, said at a briefing with reporters.New Cases in Italy’s Lombardy Region Remain Flat (8:21 a.m. NY)Lombardy’s trend of new virus cases remains flat, with no increases in the last 24 hours, the region’s governor, Attilio Fontana, said at a press conference on Thursday.“It seems what our experts have predicted is happening, and that in a few days we might see a blessed decline in the pandemic trend,” Fontana said.Germany Sees Economy Contracting 5% in 2020 (7:43 a.m. NY)The national output is expected to contract more than 5% in 2020, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said. Germany’s economy could be in position for “reasonable growth” next year, he added. Angela Merkel’s government was widely anticipated to slash its forecast from the pre-crisis prediction of 1.1% growth.Amgen Joins Hunt for Coronavirus Drug, DJ Says (7:35 a.m. NY)Amgen Inc. and Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp. are partnering to develop a drug to treat the coronavirus, Dow Jones reported on Thursday, citing an interview with David Reese, Amgen’s executive vice president of research and development.No Decisions on Domestic Travel Ban, Fauci Says (7:32 a.m. NY)“It’s on the table,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci says about whether the U.S. has any plans to restrict domestic travel. “We look at that literally every day,” he said. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he’s looking at domestic travel limits for virus hot spots.HK Orders Bars, Pubs to Close (7:28 a.m. NY)Hong Kong has ordered bars and pubs to close for 14 days from April 3. The city earlier reported 37 new cases, taking its total to 802.Boeing Offers Voluntary Buyouts (7:24 a.m. NY)Boeing Co. offered voluntary buyouts to eligible employees, in a bid to quickly shed costs and adjust its work force of 161,000 to a coronavirus crisis that’s quickly undermined the outlook for aircraft sales. The move will preserve much-needed cash at Boeing, which is facing a sharp contraction in demand along with its European rival Airbus SE.Airline customers around the world have slashed schedules, with some parking their entire fleets as the coronavirus pandemic guts travel. About 44% of aircraft across the globe are in storage.ECB Delays Strategic Review (7:21 a.m. NY)The big policy rethink, which was supposed to become the hallmark of President Christine Lagarde’s presidency, will be completed by the middle of next year, or six months later than initially planned, the ECB said on Thursday.EU Says It Should Have Acted Faster to Help Italy (7:05 a.m. NY)In a letter to Italian newspaper la Repubblica, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen admitted the bloc was late in understanding the scale of the outbreak in Italy and slow to act. She said Brussels has done far better recently.The unusual admission comes amid fear that Italy’s debt market is still vulnerable to a mass exodus by investors, even with the European Central Bank offering support through its 750 billion-euro ($820 billion) bond-buying program. The country’s yield spread over Germany, a key gauge of risk in the country remains elevated after last month’s virus-induced rout.Biden Says Sees Democratic Convention Delayed to August (7 a.m. NY)“I think it’s going to have to move into August,” Biden said in an interview on “The Tonight Show.” “I doubt whether the Democratic convention is going to be able to be held in mid-July.”Norway’s Wealth Fund Lost a Record $113 Billion in 1Q (6:41 a.m. NY)Norway’s sovereign wealth fund lost a record 1.17 trillion kroner in the first quarter as the coronavirus pandemic roiled stock markets. The loss comes as the fund for the first time faces forced asset sales to cover emergency spending by the government to weather the impact on the richest Nordic economy.Stanchart CEO Says U.K., U.S. Acted Too Late (6:35 a.m. NY)Standard Chartered Plc Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters said authorities in London and Washington have been too slow in ordering the type of lockdown that China used to control the outbreak. Speaking on Bloomberg Television, Winters became one of the highest-profile CEOs to criticize the Western response to the pandemic, saying the U.S. and U.K. had acted “too late.”“I find it interesting to listen to the debate now that we in the West, or in the U.K., or in the U.S., couldn’t have done what the Chinese did because we don’t have that kind of society,” Winters said. “Well, we are doing what the Chinese did; we’re just doing it too late.”EU’s Borrell Warns of Pandemic ‘Spiraling Out of Control’ (6:30 a.m. NY)European Union foreign-policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc must mobilize help for poor countries. “Globally, it is to be feared that the worst is yet to come,” Borrell said in a letter to foreign ministers as they prepare to hold a video conference Friday. “Countries already affected by conflicts or mismanagement are particularly vulnerable.”Jobless Claims Soar As Lockdowns Bite (6:20 a.m. NY)Earlier on Thursday, Spain said claims rose by a record 302,265 in March. Spain, one of the countries at the center of Europe’s outbreak, already has an unemployment rate that’s among the highest in the developed world.Almost a million people have claimed welfare payments in Britain over the past two weeks and even Finland, one of the world’s best-funded welfare states, is starting to crack. In Ireland, more than 300,000 people are on government support and 200,000 are classed as unemployed -- that’s a total of about half a million people in a country where around 2.3 million were in work before the crisis.And one-third of Thailand’s population has registered for government cash handouts designed to soften the blow of the novel coronavirus outbreak, far exceeding the funds available for the policy.Brexit Delay May Be Inevitable (6 a.m. NY)Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he won’t delay Britain’s final parting with the European Union at the end of the year. Empty meeting rooms across Whitehall suggest delay is all but inevitable.Business lobbyists say government officials have canceled most meetings to prepare for Brexit as civil servants are pulled away to deal with the growing coronavirus pandemic. It’s now only a question of how Johnson will sell a delay to the British public, rather than whether or not one will happen, they say.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/climate-talks-delayed-china-hid-223317939.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-30	2020-03-30 23:30:50	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	A Smart Plan to End the U.S. Lockdown Arrives Just in Time	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.S. is finally starting to take a sensible and proactive approach toward the Covid-19 pandemic. After a disastrous initial failure, coronavirus testing has now risen to levels similar to or higher than South Korea. Meanwhile, although he almost succumbed to the temptation to reopen the economy before shutdowns had time to quell the epidemic, President Donald Trump has wisely decided to recommend that social distancing continue through the end of April. And Congress, showing rare unanimity and boldness, passed a huge relief package that will sustain most households and many businesses throughout the next couple of months.But these are all simply holding actions, temporary measures to stop the virus from spreading out of control. Even the harshest lockdown will never eliminate the virus, and if restrictions are lifted without a regime in place to suppress new outbreaks, the epidemic will simply come roaring back. Meanwhile, every day the economy remains shutdown generates more losses and creates a larger backlog of un-serviced debt. That won’t work forever; an escape plan is urgently needed.A team of experts at the American Enterprise Institute has come up with exactly such a plan, and it looks like a good one. Those experts include Scott Gottlieb and Mark McClellan, both former commissioners of the Food and Drug Administration; Lauren Silvis, who previously held several high positions at the FDA; and Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security professors Caitlin Rivers and Crystal Watson.The first and most essential part of the AEI plan is to create a system that can suppress coronavirus outbreaks without lockdowns. This will require extensive testing; the plan’s authors estimate about 750,000 tests per week. Fortunately, that sort of number is now possible:Meanwhile, new rapid tests like the one from Abbott Laboratories will reduce turnaround times so that that cases can be identified in minutes instead of days. People who test positive can immediately isolate themselves.But testing and isolating isn’t enough to halt the virus because Covid-19 becomes contagious before many infected people start showing symptoms. To really halt the spread, therefore, public health authorities will need to use an approach called contact tracing. This means finding out who an infected person has had contact with in the past few days and notifying those people that they need to get tested even if  they don't show symptoms.Traditionally, as in the fight against HIV/AIDS, contact tracing was done by hand. Coronavirus moves so quickly, however, that technological solutions may be needed to speed things up. Singapore, for example, has recently made its own contact-tracing app publicly available. This app relies on Bluetooth signals to tell who has been in close physical proximity to whom.Of course, that raises privacy concerns. That has tech leaders working on alternate solutions that do contact tracing while preserving anonymity. It’s possible that Apple and Google already have the data to do this. Meanwhile, any contact-tracing app will also have to quickly notify people that they’ve been in contact with an infected person, and (ideally) route them to the nearest testing center. Those who test positive can immediately quarantine themselves at home to prevent spreading the disease.Establishing robust test-and-trace systems can start at the local and state level. However, implementing these systems will take both money and wise policy changes. The federal government should provide generous funding to help local and state governments implement test-and-trace systems. Local governments and public-health authorities, meanwhile, must loosen their testing criteria to allow for people to be tested before they show symptoms. The AEI authors also call for a national surveillance system to tie local systems together and enable contact tracing throughout the country, as well as to help infected people quarantine themselves quickly and safely.In addition to the test-and-trace approach, governments can use antibody tests to identify individuals who have already had the virus, and thus may be able to return to work safely. Germany is already experimenting with this approach.After test-and-trace systems are in place, and new cases have fallen for 14 days or more in a row, the AEI team suggest lifting shutdowns -- but not all at once. They recommend a phased reopening of businesses, with telework, distance learning and personal social distancing continuing as much as possible, while maintaining indefinite bans on gatherings of more than 50 people. Only once a vaccine against COVID-19 is developed -- probably in mid-2021 -- can all restrictions be lifted. And if outbreaks do spiral out of control in a city or state, the AEI team recommends a swift but temporary return to shutdown.The battle against coronavirus will thus be a long one. But in a few weeks the tide may turn. The AEI plan provides a great road map for coming out of hiding and going on the offensive.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Noah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Gap Inc. said it would furlough most of its U.S. and Canada store employees as it anticipates closures to extend past a previously announced April 1 date. Ascena Retail Group, the owner of chains including Ann Taylor, announced a similar move. Macy’s Inc. said earlier Monday that it would furlough most of its roughly 130,000 workers this week.Consumer spending has “sharply declined” amid the pandemic, according to Visa Inc., which lowered its outlook for revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter.J&J Surges After Vaccine Deal With U.S. Government (4:25 p.m. NY)Johnson & Johnson jumped 8% after the company said it would begin a $1 billion-plus effort with the U.S. government to make a vaccine against the virus. It will work with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, an arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to further develop a vaccine the company said it’s been working on since January.J&J said it plans to begin building manufacturing capacity for a billion doses of the vaccine. Early doses may be ready for emergency use as soon as January.Read the full story hereCalifornia Calls for Non-Practicing Health-Care Workers (4:13 p.m. NY)California Governor Gavin Newsom made a call to non-practicing health-care workers, asking them to help with the anticipated surge in hospitalizations. “We need you,” he said of nurses, doctors, pharmacists and emergency medical technicians. Facebook Inc. has committed $25 million to provide stipends for additional costs health-care workers might face from childcare to hotel rooms, Newsom said in a press briefing.In the past four days, California’s number of hospitalizations related to the virus have roughly doubled to more than 1,400. The progression matches the state’s modeling, Newsom said, meaning California is on track to needing an additional 50,000 hospital beds and people to staff them.Charges Filed Against Florida Pastor Who Held Services (3:15 p.m. NY)Charges were filed against a Florida pastor who held in-person services at his megachurch on Sunday, Hillsborough Country Sheriff Chad Chronister said during a press conference on Monday. An arrest warrant was issued for Rodney Howard-Browne, who yesterday compared the pandemic to a flu and dismissed the advice of public health experts.Howard-Browne’s behavior was described as “reckless disregard for public safety” by Chronister. The local county is under a stay-at-home order as the state of Florida deals with skyrocketing coronavirus cases and deaths.N.Y. Cases Slowing Though Fatalities Still on Rise (2:17 p.m. NY)New York state reported 253 new coronavirus fatalities on Monday, a 26% increase, but Governor Andrew Cuomo also offered some positive news: The rise in confirmed cases is slowing, and the hospital-discharge rate is rising.While the doubling of infections has slowed from every two days to every six, the number of people who had to be moved into intensive care with intubation surged in one day, the governor said at a briefing in Manhattan.New York added almost 7,000 confirmed infections overnight, for a total of more than 66,000, Cuomo said. Of those, roughly 9,500 are hospitalized, an increase of more than 1,000, and about 2,350 were in intensive care, up 315.France Hospital Deaths Rise by Most to Date (1:56 p.m. NY)France reported 418 deaths in hospitals, the most in a day for the country. The number doesn’t include deaths in other locations, and will add those figures later in the week, according to the health ministry’s press office. The jump brings the total number of hospital deaths to 3,024.Israel PM Netanyahu Tests Negative for Virus (1:45 p.m.)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his family and close aides tested negative for Covid-19, his office said in a statement. One of his aides who he was in contact with has the virus, prompting them to go into isolation and be tested. He will remain in isolation until receiving further instructions from the health ministry.N.J. Files Charges for Violating Social-Distancing Orders (1:25 p.m. NY)In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy made good on a promise to name and shame people accused of violating social-distancing orders. His attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, sent out a news release detailing cases against a score of people, an unusual move for low-level offenses like disorderly conduct.Among the residents facing charges are four buddies who met to drag race in a school parking lot, men who held weddings, a woman who left her home to toss a Molotov cocktail at her boyfriend’s residence -- unsuccessfully -- and a billiards hall owner who reopened after he was ordered to close. At least a dozen people have been charged with threatening to transmit the virus.Italy Reports Fewest New Cases in Two Weeks (12:30 p.m. NY)Italy reported the smallest number of new coronavirus cases in almost two weeks as the epicenter of Europe’s contagion enters its fourth week of lockdown.New infections in the past 24 hours totaled 4,050, compared with 5,217 the previous day, civil protection authorities said Monday at their daily news conference in Rome. This is the lowest increase since March 17.Fatalities rose by 812 on Monday compared with 756 on Sunday, bringing the total to 11,591. Italy now has 101,739 total cases, the most after the U.S.Read more hereEurope Expected to Start Stabilizing Soon, WHO Says (12:18 p.m. NY)European countries that took measures two to three weeks ago will probably begin to show some signs of stabilization soon, according to Mike Ryan, head of health emergencies at the World Health Organization. The WHO hopes Italy and Spain are nearly at the peak, though reducing the number of new cases requires proactive measures, Ryan said at a press briefing Monday.To know if they are testing enough, countries should be getting roughly 10 negative results for every confirmed infection, Ryan said. “If 80 or 90% of the people you test are positive, you are probably missing a lot of cases.”All Covid-19 patients should be taken to health facilities rather than staying at home, and their close contacts also ideally should be isolated outside the home, he said. Singapore’s success in containing the virus came by sending community workers door-to-door, checking people for symptoms such as fever, and immediately taking anyone suspected to be infected to a testing center, he said.EU Finance Ministers to Meet April 7 on Response (12:01 p.m. NY)Euro-area finance ministers will meet on April 7 to deliver proposals to reinforce the EU’s policy response to the coronavirus, Eurogroup President Mario Centeno said on Twitter.Their meeting comes after EU leaders last week struggled to find common ground on how best to cushion to the impact of the pandemic. Instead, they gave their finance chiefs two weeks to produce new proposals amid disagreements over whether they should deploy the bloc’s bailout fund or push with more ambitious plans such as joint debt in the form of so-called coronabonds.French Fashion Brands Ramp Up Mask Production (12:01 p.m. NY)The French fashion sector’s push to supply protective masks is on track to produce 480,000 units per day with 45 companies participating, Deputy Economy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said. Those masks, often reusable, will be intended as an additional protection measure for people working outside the medical sector.France’s makers of surgical masks are also ramping up production, targeting 40 million masks in April, Pannier-Runacher said Monday in a briefing to press.Lacoste, Yves Saint-Laurent and Chanel are among the French fashion makers that have said they’ll participate in the effort.CureVac to Start Trials This Summer, Focus Says (10:30 a.m. NY)The German biotech CureVac AG will start a trial of a potential coronavirus vaccine in early summer, the magazine Focus reported, citing an interview with CureVac supervisory board member Friedrich von Bohlen. The vaccine could be ready be year-end.Earlier this month, CureVac denied speculation that the U.S. government tried to buy the business or its technology amid the intensifying race to produce a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.Abbott Surges on Five-Minute Test (9:45 a.m. NY)Abbott Laboratories shares surged after the company unveiled a coronavirus test that can tell if someone is infected in as little as five minutes, and is so small and portable it can be used in almost any health-care setting.The medical-device maker plans to supply 50,000 tests a day starting April 1, said John Frels, vice president of research and development at Abbott Diagnostics. The molecular test looks for fragments of the coronavirus genome, which can quickly be detected when present at high levels. A thorough search to definitively rule out an infection can take up to 13 minutes, he said.Read more herePoland Election Plan Faces Pushback (9:45 a.m. NY)Pressure is growing on Poland’s ruling party to delay the May 10 presidential election as the authorities introduce more curbs on civil liberties to contain the coronavirus.On Monday, a deputy science minister became the first government official to publicly call for the vote to be postponed.

These efforts will help close loopholes in epidemic control work, according to a statement released on the website of the State Council, the top administrative body in China.Trump Says Hazard Pay for Hospitals Is Being Looked At (8:49 a.m. NY)The president told Fox News that hazard pay for hospital workers dealing with the coronavirus is being looked at. He said hospitals were being asked to consider possible bonuses, among other measures.Tokyo Governor Urges Residents to Avoid Night Clubs (8:39 a.m. NY)Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike urged residents to avoid bars and night clubs, which are seen to be behind a recent increase in virus cases in the city. Tokyo reported 13 new cases of infection on Monday, bringing the total to 443.U.A.E. to Open Drive-Through Testing Centers (8:33 a.m. NY)The United Arab Emirates plans to open drive-through testing centers nationwide, the official news agency WAM reported on Monday.Netherlands Reports Its Slowest Case Growth: (8:20 a.m. NY)New cases in the Netherlands rose by 8% to 11,750, the smallest daily gain since the country reported its first case in late February. The RIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment also said total deaths climbed to 864 after it recorded 93 more fatalities, an increase of 12%, below the recent average.The growth of new cases has slowed gradually over the past week. The RIVM expects to be able to say whether there’s a real flattening over the course of this week.The government is set to extend restrictions, such as keeping schools and restaurants closed, until after April 6, Dutch news agency ANP reported.Portugal Cases Slow (7:54 a.m. NY)The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Portugal rose 7.5% to 6,408 as of 11 a.m. on Monday from 5,962 on Sunday morning, the government’s Directorate-General of Health said. That’s slower than a daily increase of 15% reported on Sunday and a 21% gain on Saturday. The total number of deaths increased to 140 on Monday from 119 reported through Sunday morning.Germany Asks Companies to Suspend Dividends (7:53 a.m. NY)German listed companies will have to suspend dividend payments to qualify for government assistance designed to ease the impact of the coronavirus crisis, according to two people familiar with the policy.Decisions will be taken on a case by case basis, but the general rule will be that dividends should not be paid if companies want to tap into the aid program and borrow from state bank KfW, said the people, who asked not to be identified by name because the policy isn’t public. The KfW declined to comment.Germany is in line with France in insisting firms forgo dividend payments.The Latest on Covid-19 Tests and Vaccines (7:30 a.m. NY)Johnson & Johnson rose in pre-market trading after saying it had selected a lead Covid-19 vaccine candidate. The company expects to initiate human clinical studies latest by September and anticipates the first batches of a vaccine could be available for emergency use authorization in early 2021.Earlier, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he expects data about remdesivir “in month or so” that will indicate whether the drug works for coronavirus and whether it’s safe to use.Meanwhile, Abbott Laboratories shares rose 18% in U.S. pre-market trading after the company introduced a coronavirus test that can tell if someone is infected in as little as five minutes, and is so small and portable it can be used in almost any health-care setting.And Israel has developed a 3D-printed sticker to attach to a standard surgical mask to increase its protective capabilities.

2020-03-30	2020-03-30 20:30:50	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Markets May Have Found What They're Looking For	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The global stock market rallied on Monday for the fourth time in five days. The MSCI All-Country World Index is up 15.9% since March 23, led higher by gains in the U.S. Does this mean the carnage is over? Nobody can say for sure, and for every Wall Street firm saying yes, there’s another warning that the worst is yet to come. Yet, there was a lot to like about how markets gained at the start of the week.What was most encouraging about the latest action is that it came despite a slew of news that, one would think, would be negative for riskier assets. Yes, the news out of Abbott Laboratories that it has developed a coronavirus test that can tell if someone is infected in as little as five minutes did a lot to boost sentiment. But that’s where the optimism mostly ends. Over the weekend, top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said U.S. coronavirus deaths alone could reach 200,000, prompting President Donald Trump to extend nationwide social-distancing recommendations until April 30. The deadly and widespread nature of the pandemic was hammered home with the news that a longtime senior Wall Street executive died of virus complications. Risk sentiment not only overcame that news, but also more fundamental issues such as a broad gain in the dollar and another big decline in oil prices, this time to an 18-year low. A rising dollar and plunging oil prices had contributed almost as much to the equity market sell-off in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic as the expanding virus itself. The point here is that the market rallied in the face of negative news, which many suggested would be a prerequisite for stocks to regain their footing.There’s more to it than just the dollar and oil. The equity strategists at Bloomberg Intelligence note that in recent days, “reactions to earnings downgrades and buyback suspensions also turned positive, perhaps indicating most bad news is already in the price.” More specifically, they point out that stocks of companies that pared their earnings-growth targets did better over the past week than those with a higher bar, suggesting a considerable amount of negativity is reflected in prices.” When historians looks back on the stock market during this time, it’s possible that March 30 could be seen as a pivotal moment.A RUN ON BANK LOANSBloomberg News reports that the biggest U.S. banks have been discouraging some of the safest corporate borrowers from tapping existing credit lines to see them through the coronavirus pandemic. The issue isn’t that banks don’t have the funds, but that offering revolving lines of credit to investment-grade borrowers is a low-margin business. Lenders provide the service more for relationship purposes, hoping those customers will tap the banks for more profitable work over time. Based on the latest weekly data from the Federal Reserve, this issue could potentially be a drag on bank earnings as more companies seek to ensure they have cash on hand. Commercial and industrial loans outstanding surged by $176.2 billion, or 7.41%, to $2.55 trillion in the latest weekly period, Fed data released late Friday showed. That’s by far the most in any week going back to 1973. The good news is that big lenders are perceived to be better capitalized than at any time in history, which diminishes the possibility of a bank collapse. Still, that doesn’t mean their earnings won’t take a hit. That may help explain why the KBW Bank Index’s 40.1% plunge this year is more than double that of the S&P 500 Index’s 18.7% drop.CONSUMER CUSHION?Almost everyone agrees that the U.S. economy is headed into a recession, and may already be in one. How deep and long-lasting the contraction is depends on a host of factors, not the least of which is the financial health of consumers. In that regard, the prognosis is mixed. On the downside, 25% of U.S. workers make less than $600 a week, and delinquency rates on all types of consumer loans are the highest in about six years, according to Deutsche Bank strategist Torsten Slok. Meanwhile, household borrowing accelerated to a 4.1% increase in the fourth quarter, reaching $16.15 trillion, Fed data released earlier this month showed. On the other hand, household wealth surged, rising $3.15 trillion to a record $118.4 trillion, indicating Americans were in generally healthy financial shape prior to the pandemic. Looked at another way, U.S. household debt as a percentage of disposable income has come way down since the financial crisis, falling to 96.7% from 133.6% in 2007. And in another encouraging sign, savings as a percentage of disposable income has jumped to 8.1% from 2.2% in 2005. No doubt the pandemic will take a toll on consumer finances, but the data may mean that consumers also rebound much faster than expected.EM BEATS G-10In times of crisis, markets resort to predictable patterns. That means fleeing anything viewed as risky, such as emerging market currencies, and jumping into assets deemed safe, such as the currencies of Group of 10 economies. But globalization and the rise in importance of certain developing-nation economies have made such knee-jerk reactions obsolete. Some new research from Standard Chartered strategists Ilya Gofshteyn and Steve Englander found that currencies of “good EMs” tend to outperform those of “bad G-10s” in a time of crisis, and have done so this year. They identify “good EMs” as most of the universe of major emerging-market currencies less the Turkish lira, Brazil real, South African rand, Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah. In many ways, this makes sense. Many emerging-market economies are in much better fiscal shape than developed nations, having stockpiled dollars for the proverbial rainy day. At $3.13 trillion, the foreign-exchange reserves for the 12 largest EM economies excluding China is up from less than $2 trillion in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.TEA LEAVESA big week for U.S. economic data kicks off Tuesday when the Conference Board releases consumer confidence data for March. As with other measures of March that have already been released, this one is unlikely to be encouraging. The headline number is seen tumbling to 110 from 130.7 in February. The real number to look at, though, will be the one that looks at how consumers feel about the future. That part of the survey hadn’t reached the heights of the one that measures how consumers feel about the current situation. This may help explain the elevated savings rate noted above, as consumers socked away money for the tougher times they knew would ultimately hit even before the coronavirus. If that number fails to fall as much as the present situation reading, it could help further underpin investor sentiment on the idea that the economic rebound, when it comes, will be impressive.DON’T MISS  Don’t Read Too Much Into Stocks’ Sudden Rally: Mohamed El-Erian Markets No Longer Know How to Define 'Safe': Jared Dillian Fed Lax Corporate Lending Invites Trouble: Narayana Kocherlakota How to Win Coming Battle Over U.S. National Debt: Karl Smith Junk Bonds Should Never Be Backstopped by Fed: Brian ChappattaThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Robert Burgess is an editor for Bloomberg Opinion.

During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.For those who don't have the time to tune in live or listen to the podcast, Benzinga will highlight one stock that merits further discussion. This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation.Traders, investors and especially algorithms are keying on pharma or biotech stocks that may play a role in developing testing kits, vaccines or even a cure for the coronavirus. One issue that attracted a buying frenzy in after-hours trading on Friday and in premarket trading Monday was Abbott Labs (NYSE: ABT).FDA Authorizes Fast-Acting Test To Detect COVID-19 On Friday evening well after the close, Abbott announced that the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for the fastest available molecular point-of-care test for the detection of COVID-19. An added bonus: the test delivers positive results in as little as 5 minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.Traders, Algorithms Nibble On The News, Then Gorge With limited liquidity in the closing hour or so of the after-hours session, the issue moved from the $74 area to as high as $77 before ending the session at $76.35.As the news circulated on the wires over the weekend, the issue opened sharply higher at 4 a.m. Monday at $84.95 and continued in that direction on heavy volume. It did not peak until it came within striking distance of its all-time-high ($92.45), reaching $91.50. At that point, the big sellers came in and began to take profits.Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world. For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter.How Much Will Abbott's Test Have An Impact On Earnings? It is hard to deny that the test will be a positive for the company and will have a positive impact on its futures earnings. PreMarket Prep co-host Dennis Dick questioned the degree of that impact. While the issue was being discussed on the show Monday, it was trading in the $87 area. Dick said that adding $30 billion in market cap to a $131-billion company overnight was overdone.He said he was hoping to short the issue in the $90 area, but was never afforded the opportunity.The stock was trading 7.32% higher at $80.02 at the time of publication. Abbott Moving Forward Investors that are long the issue should pay close attention to Monday's price action, including the high, low and close. It is imperative that the issue continues to make new daily high and closes to push itself back toward its all-time-high.If today's low of $78.47 is breached, there may be limited support in the issue until Friday's closing price of $74.56.Photo courtesy of Abbott.

2020-03-30	2020-03-30 16:01:11	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Five-Minute Coronavirus Tests Will Aid Every Stage of the Fight	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Americans anxious about their coronavirus status and ability to get tested got excellent news over the weekend. On Saturday, medical-device giant Abbott Laboratories said it got the green light from the Food and Drug Administration to roll out a new rapid and portable Covid-19 test. It’s going to start doing so this week.Abbott's test can detect the virus in as little as five minutes and runs on a 6.6-pound machine that is already set up in doctors offices around the country to test for strep throat and flu. That will go a long way toward fixing a key problem  — a lack of adequate and available diagnostic tools — that  allowed the disease to spread widely and rapidly in the U.S., which in turn helped convince President Donald Trump to extend federal social distancing guidelines through at least April 30. Current tests take hours to run and are unevenly distributed, adding to the problem, while some labs are so backed up that people are left without results for days or weeks. Faster and widely dispersed testing should help the U.S. track the virus better and slow the spread. The speediness and portability of the platform means testing can take place in a wider variety of spaces; that will keep people safer. And while the worst of the crisis is yet to come and the U.S needs to slow infections before it can think about reopening the economy, once infection rates come down, rapid and portable testing can also hasten a recovery. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb published an excellent roadmap over the weekend for how the U.S. can cautiously get back to normal. It divides the response into four categories: slowing the spread, state-by-state reopening, lifting physical distancing, and rebuilding readiness. Abbott's test isn't going to get America past any milestones on its own. But the rapid diagnostic and others like it can play a unique role at each stage.The priorities for slowing the spread are preventing new transmission via social distancing and keeping the health system from being overwhelmed. That's hard when people line up outside of packed hospitals waiting to get tested. Once Abbott’s test is up and running, governments should work aggressively to direct people with mild symptoms or suspected exposure toward clinics, smaller physician practices, urgent-care facilities, or even pharmacies where it should be made widely available. These moves would create distance, reduce burdens on hospital workers, get individuals peace of mind and needed medical and behavioral information in minutes, while giving governments much-needed data.Cautiously reopening the economy in states that are seeing declining cases will require substantially boosted surveillance to prevent a second wave of infections. Rapid and widely dispersed testing will be essential. Coupled with antibody testing to establish acquired immunity and stepped-up public hygiene, states and employers can work with a wide net of convenient providers to get people screened before they return to work without putting them at risk. Rapid tests will also help governments move from broad mitigation to targeted contact tracing and isolation. High-risk individuals will likely still stay isolated, and low-density strategies will remain the rule, but parts of the population could begin to live a relatively normal life. The reopening will be crucial for the economy, and responsibly doing so will help divert resources to areas that are still at the height of an outbreak. Public health measures are all intended to buy time to build true national surveillance capability and effective treatments. Rapid diagnostics will be the backbone of tracing efforts and can identify candidates for early intervention. An optimal roll-out of these new tests will be difficult, given the fragmented nature of America’s response so far. But if the U.S. embraces the challenge, it will get both immediate relief and a quicker road out of sheltering in place.   This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2020-03-30	2020-03-30 13:40:01	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott Surges After Unveiling Five-Minute Coronavirus Test	(Bloomberg) -- Abbott Laboratories shares surged in U.S. trading after the company unveiled a coronavirus test that can tell if someone is infected in as little as five minutes, and is so small and portable it can be used in almost any health-care setting.The stock gained as much as 13% in New York, the biggest intraday gain since 2002. The shares were up 9.9% to $81.94 at 9:36 a.m. in New York.The medical-device maker plans to supply 50,000 tests a day starting April 1, said John Frels, vice president of research and development at Abbott Diagnostics. The molecular test looks for fragments of the coronavirus genome, which can quickly be detected when present at high levels. A thorough search to definitively rule out an infection can take up to 13 minutes, he said.Abbott has received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration “for use by authorized laboratories and patient care settings,” the company said late Friday.The U.S. has struggled to supply enough tests to detect the virus, even as the outbreak threatens to overwhelm hospitals in New York, California, Washington and other regions. After initially restricting testing to high-risk people, and problems with a test designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. regulators have rushed out diagnostics made by the world’s leading commercial-testing companies.“This is really going to provide a tremendous opportunity for front-line caregivers, those having to diagnose a lot of infections, to close the gap with our testing,” Frels said. “A clinic will be able to turn that result around quickly, while the patient is waiting.”The technology builds on Illinois-based Abbott’s ID Now platform, the most common point-of-care test currently available in the U.S., with more than 18,000 units spread across the country. It is widely used to detect influenza, strep throat and respiratory syncytial virus, a common bug that causes cold-like symptoms.The test starts with taking a swab from the nose or the back of the throat, then mixing it with a chemical solution that breaks open the virus and releases its RNA. The mixture is inserted into an ID Now system, a small box weighing just under 7 pounds that has the technology to identify and amplify select sequences of the coronavirus genome and ignore contamination from other viruses.The equipment can be set up almost anywhere, but the company is working with its customers and the Trump administration to ensure the first cartridges used to perform the tests are sent to where they are most needed. They are targeting hospital emergency rooms, urgent-care clinics and doctors’ offices.Last week, Abbott’s m2000 RealTime system got U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for use in hospitals and molecular laboratories to diagnose the infection. That system can churn through more tests on a daily basis, as many as 1 million a week, but it takes longer to get the results. Abbott plans to provide at least 5 million tests a month between the two systems.Other companies are also rolling out faster testing systems. Henry Schein Inc. on Thursday said its point-of-care antibody test, which looks for evidence that a person’s immune system has already fought off the infection, was available. The blood test can be given at the point of care and delivers results in about 15 minutes, though it can’t be used to definitively diagnose a current infection.(Updates shares in the second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbott-shares-surge-pre-market-084450099.html?.tsrc=rss

For BNEF’s view of the impact on energy, click here.U.S. Mulls Metro NYC Quarantine (12:23 p.m. NY)President Trump said he’s considering an enforced quarantine in areas of New York and New Jersey to curb the outbreak.Trump told reporters he had spoken with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo before departing the White House to send off a Navy hospital ship bound for New York City from Norfolk, Virginia.The president said he’d rather not impose such a quarantine but that the country may need it. Asked about his ambition to urge many Americans to return to work by the Easter holiday on April 12, Trump said “we’ll see what happens.”New York and New Jersey have more than half the U.S. Covid-19 cases.Northern Italy Deaths Near 6,000 (12:10 p.m. NY)Deaths in Italy’s northern Lombardy region rose by 542 to 5,944, according to a person familiar with the matter. New cases in the area around Milan rose by 2,117 to 39,415, the person said, asking not to be named because Lombardy’s data aren’t public.Lombardy has been at the epicenter of Italy’s outbreak, which is the worst in Europe with more than 86,000 cases. The region accounts for almost half of all cases in Italy.Michigan Cases Top U.S. Rate (12:05 p.m. NY)Michigan is becoming the next U.S. coronavirus hotspot, registering new cases at more than triple the national rate. The state had 3,657 cases as of Friday -- versus zero just over two weeks ago -- and now ranks fifth in the nation. At least 92 people have died.Impoverished Detroit and surrounding Wayne County made up half the state total. Suburban Oakland County, home for thousands of white-collar auto jobs, had 23% of cases.Other Midwestern cities are posting sharp increases. Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, saw cases rise from 413 at the end of last week to more than 1,900 Friday, according to data from the University of Chicago. The county accounts for three-quarters of the state’s total.Outbreaks in Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennesee also accelerated recently. Cases in Nashville’s Davidson County quadrupled in a week, as did those in Orleans Parish, Louisiana.Read the full story hereSerbia Expands Mandatory Isolation (11:55 a.m. NY)Serbia doubled the mandatory isolation period for people returning from abroad to 28 days and extended the weekend curfew by two hours as total infections jumped the most in a day on Saturday.The biggest former Yugoslav republic reported 131 new cases, bringing the total to 659. Ten people have died and about as many are in critical condition, Health Minister Zlatibor Loncar said.Russia to Shut Borders (11:40 a.m. NY)Russia will temporarily shut its borders starting March 30 after a sharp increase in infections in the past week. on Saturday, health officials reported 228 new cases overnight, bringing the total to 1,264, with four deaths.The order, posted on the government website, followed increasingly harsh limits on movement. Moscow’s mayor shut all non-essential business on Saturday and recommended everyone stay home. The government halted international flights on Friday and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin called on regions to close most businesses, but stopped short of issuing an order.The government is considering a temporary halt of domestic flights and trains, Interfax reported, citing an unidentified official.Read the story hereU.K. Has Most Deaths in a Day (10:30 a.m. NY)The U.K. reported a 34% increase in deaths in one day, its biggest surge since the outbreak began.Fatalities jumped by 260, to 1,019, as of late Friday, the Department of Health and Social Care reported.

2020-01-30	2020-01-30 21:33:09	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Apple’s Success Reversing Patent Cases May Dim CalTech’s Win	(Bloomberg) -- If any company knows how to get rid of a billion-dollar patent-infringement verdict, it’s Apple Inc.Apple pledged to appeal Wednesday’s $1.1 billion verdict won by California Institute of Technology, in which it was told to pay $838 million and its chip supplier Broadcom Inc. was hit with $270 million in royalties by a federal jury in Los Angeles. Apple is counting on its past history challenging such verdicts to mean good odds for the future.In the past decade, the iPhone maker has evaded a $533 million verdict over controlling digital content, a $506 million judgment over microprocessor technology and a $625.5 million verdict for a way to display documents. In cases Apple hasn’t won, the company keeps fighting -- it’s been embroiled in a decade-long fight to avoid paying as much as $1 billion over secure communications to VirnetX Holding Corp.“They are certainly one of the most targeted entities out there, so it makes sense for them to aggressively defend themselves when they don’t see a path to settlement,” said Jonathan Stroud, chief intellectual property counsel for Unified Patents LLC, which challenges patents used in litigation against its members, including Apple. “Otherwise they’ll be seen as an ATM and continue to be targeted regardless.”Led by Chief Litigation Counsel Noreen Krall, Apple’s strategy has been geared to maintaining the company’s high-profit margin. That means waging a years-long battle with Samsung Electronics Co. when Apple thought the Korean electronics maker had copied iPhone designs and a no-holds-barred fight with chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. to lower royalties it pays on critical telecommunications technology.The cases don’t always end in complete victories. Apple continued to lose market share to Samsung, and its battle with Qualcomm ended in a settlement where it paid the chipmaker billions of dollars and agreed to start using its chips again.“This is just the starting point,” said Bridget Smith, a lawyer with Lowenstein & Weatherwax in Los Angeles, of Wednesday’s verdict. “They’re still going to have to win on appeal.”Apple also has been accused of being a bully when it comes to using other companies’ inventions. Medical device maker Masimo Corp. claims Apple stole health monitoring technology, and a Florida company that makes “virtual iPhones” to test for flaws has accused Apple of trying to control security research.The big-dollar verdicts against Apple are in part because of its size. The $838 million won by CalTech is less than two days’ worth of sales for Apple and is equal to less than 2% of the company’s $55.3 billion net income in fiscal 2019.Broadcom’s share of the verdict could mean a bigger rap to its bottom line. The San Jose-based chipmaker reported $22.6 billion in sales in the fiscal year ended Nov. 3, and net income of $2.7 billion. Broadcom fell as much as 2.8% Thursday on the news.CalTech said it was “committed to protecting its intellectual property in furtherance of its mission to expand human knowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education.”District Court Judge George Wu, who presided over the trial, has ordered a telephone conference Feb. 6 to determine the next steps in the case. The verdict is the sixth-largest for a patent-infringement case in U.S. history, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. No $1 billion-plus patent verdict has ever stood -- they are tossed on appeal or settle for a lower amount.“Less than a hundred million, there’s not a lot of attention,” said Bernard Chao, a professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law. “But when you get in excess of nine figures, I think you start raising eyebrows and drawing attention.”The biggest decision won by a university was a $1.17 billion verdict won by Carnegie Mellon University against Marvell Technology Group Ltd. in 2013. An appeals court later ordered that damages be recalculated and the case settled for $750 million.“When you have a number that big, the courts scrutinize the verdict and say ‘Is this legit?’” said Patrick McElhinny of K&L Gates in Pittsburgh, who represented Carnegie Mellon. “They typically are. As long as they are grounded in the record, they are perfectly appropriate.”Apple and other Silicon Valley companies have been trying to lower how much patent owners can collect in damages for years. They have argued too often juries are awarding big awards when the invention is for a tiny component in a complex device.The concern, said Timothy Holbrook, a professor at Emory Law in Atlanta, is “giving too much weight to the value of this technology as it relates to a broader product.”Working to limit damages is at the heart of a Supreme Court petition Apple has filed seeking to overturn a $439 million judgment won by VirnetX. In a second case involving the same patents but newer products, a federal appeals court ordered a recalculation of a $503 million verdict.“There is no doubt that they’ll spend a large amount of money to fight to the bitter end even long after it’s become crystal clear they should take responsibility via a license,” said Brad Caldwell of Caldwell Cassady Curry in Dallas, who has represented VirnetX for the past decade.Even as tech companies want to avoid paying high royalties, universities are trying to collect more money from their research, with recent lawsuits filed by the University of California against Abbott Laboratories over an infant formula and lighting companies and retailers over LED bulbs, along with a cross-country battle among research institutes over who will get royalties on ground-breaking gene-editing technology.Universities are seen as the incubators for new ideas and have to rely on a sometimes fickle federal government for funding, said Peter Corless, a patent lawyer with Mintz Levin in Boston who often represents universities.“Everyone is so under pressure to come up with funds to be more competitive and put together better packages for incoming professors,” Corless said. The universities nonetheless have been asking themselves “If we start asserting some of our patents against blue chip corporate America is that appropriate for us and who we are?”While many legal experts predict the damages award will be cut, if Apple doesn’t get an outright victory, Corless said CalTech won’t give up without a fight.“It’s a big deal,” he said. “It would change an institution if they get the money.”(Adds comment from VirnetX lawyer in 19th paragraph.

2020-01-17	2020-01-17 11:51:46	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: IBM, Abbott Labs, and FuelCell Energy	Earnings season looms next year at a key point for the market. U.S. stocks are at all-time highs, and need a strong batch of earnings reports to keep the momentum going.Source: Shutterstock That's particularly true for the three stocks featured in Friday's big stock charts. Technically, all three names have clear potential for big moves in the next few weeks. In each case, an important upcoming earnings report represents a catalyst.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 To be sure, it's not 100% clear in which direction these stocks will head. But for investors willing to firmly pick a side, or traders looking for potential volatility, these big stock charts should be watched closely in the coming weeks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips International Business Machines (IBM)Source: Provided by Finviz IBM (NYSE:IBM) is trying to rally ahead of its fourth quarter earnings report on Tuesday afternoon. But while the first of Friday's big stock charts suggests some cause for optimism, recent history suggests reason for caution:  * Technically, IBM stock is at least set up for a rally. Shares have exited a narrowing wedge to the upside, and cleared near-term moving averages in the process. The 200-day moving average has provided resistance that IBM stock will need to move through, but a strong fourth quarter report could provide the required boost.  * A strong report is necessary. IBM's acquisition of Red Hat closed in July, and was supposed to allow IBM to finally get back to growth. The company infamously went 22 consecutive quarters without generating year-over-year revenue growth, and returned to declines after breaking the streak in 2017. As a result, IBM stock has gained just 4.7% total over the past decade, while the S&P 500 has nearly tripled.  * And so this is an important reason on multiple fronts. The 2020 outlook, which includes a full year of Red Hat, needs to be strong enough to inspire confidence. The chart both reflects and amplifies the fundamental importance of the quarter: trading in IBM stock next week seems likely to set its direction for some time to come. There's a path to challenge July highs around $150 with a beat, and a potential reversal to $125 if IBM disappoints once again. Abbott Laboratories (ABT)Source: Provided by Finviz Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has posted much more impressive multi-year performance: shares in fact have more than doubled since late 2016. But resistance has been stiff of late, and Abbott Labs likely needs a strong fourth quarter report on Wednesday morning to break out:  * ABT stock certainly is gearing up for another run, with strong performance in recent sessions on decent volume. An uptrend has held since early October and investors quickly bought a small, brief dip last week. For now, anyway, shares certainly are headed in the right direction.  * Here, too, it likely takes a strong fourth quarter report for the stock to break out. Abbott will not only detail Q4 results next week, but will give guidance for 2020. Wall Street projects about 11% growth in earnings per share this year, a reasonably high bar to clear. It's too simplistic to argue that ABT will rise if guidance exceeds expectations and falls if it doesn't -- but it doesn't seem too far off. At the least, the second of our big stock charts suggests it will be exceedingly difficult to break out if Abbott can't deliver an above-consensus outlook.  * Some help from the market would be useful as well. Abbott unquestionably is a wonderful company, recently increasing its dividend for the 48th consecutive year. But like most wonderful companies in this market, valuation is a question mark: the 24x forward multiple is historically high. If Abbott can deliver a big report next week, that multiple will be less of an issue. If it simply matches expectations, it will need investors to keep paying up for quality. FuelCell Energy (FCEL)Source: Provided by Finviz FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL) has been one of the market's best stocks in the past seven months, gaining over 1,500% from late June lows. And the third of Friday's big stock charts suggests the rally could have another leg:  * Technically, FCEL stock has established a classic flag formation, with the parabolic gain the &quot;flagpole&quot; and the sideways trading since the flag. Those patterns are continuation patterns, which often lead to another bounce higher after the stock consolidates. A recent &quot;golden cross,&quot; in which the 50-day moving average moves above the 200-day, adds to the bullishness shown on the chart.  *   Click to Enlarge Source: Provided by Finviz That said, taking the broader view, the risks become apparent simply from the chart. Amazingly, FCEL stock is down 65.5% over the past year even after the enormous rally of late. It has declined 98.6% in the last five years. FuelCell Energy has delivered optimism before, but it's always disappointed.  * And so FuelCell's fourth quarter report, also on Wednesday, looks exceedingly important. FCEL stock is trying to follow the path of fellow (if different) fuel cell play Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), which has re-inspired investor confidence over the last year. A new agreement with Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and a game-changing loan agreement seem to have de-risked the story. If FuelCell Energy can deliver a positive quarter and a strong outlook next week, the rally can and should continue.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-10-16	2019-10-16 19:49:53	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	5 Top Stock Trades for Thursday: ADBE, NFLX, ABT	The indices did not move too much on Wednesday, but a handful of tech stocks were hit hard on the day. Let's look at a few of the top stock trades going into the latter half of the week. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Adobe (ADBE)Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) came under pressure Wednesday following a downgrade from Citi analysts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares have been trying to break out over downtrend resistance (blue line) and were actually succeeding before Wednesday. However, the tepid bullish action was not enough to withstand today's selling.Nor were the 20-day and 200-day moving averages, as ADBE stock gapped below both metrics. However, it's finding some reprieve from the 38.2% retracement. Now investors want to know, can ADBE reclaim the 200-day and downtrend resistance or are lower prices in store?If it's the latter, look for a decline down into the $258 to $260 area. There it will find a notable level of support as well as the 50% retracement. If that fails to hold, ADBE stock may be in trouble. On the upside, the charts are pretty cluttered until Adobe can clear the 50-day moving average. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Netflix (NFLX)Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is very much a mixed picture ahead of the company's earnings report on Wednesday after the close.On the plus side, shares have broken out over downtrend resistance (blue line) and are maintaining above the 20-day moving average. On the downside, they are stuck below the 50-day moving average and the 38.2% retracement.So what now?Should shares decline, look to see if the 23.6% retracement at $267.75 can support the name. If not, $260 could be on deck, with the September low of $252.28 below that. Below the September low and the December low is possible.On the upside, see that NFLX reclaims and holds the 50-day moving average and 38.2% retracement. Above that opens the door to the 50% and 61.8% retracements at $308.61 and $326.81, respectively. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Abbott Labs (ABT)Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) was mixed on Wednesday after it reported earnings. However, with clear-cut support nearby and breakout potential, it's worth watching.Look at the past year of action. Shares have a consolidation period, then tend to break out to new highs and consolidate again. The old highs also tend to become support.Luckily, the prior highs near $79 to $80 also intersect with the 200-day moving average and 61.8% retracement. That makes it a pretty solid risk/reward area for investors. Below $79 and traders may consider stopping out.On the upside, see if ABT stock can break out over downtrend resistance and the 50-day moving average. Over it and a move back to $86-plus could be in the cards. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: ServiceNow (NOW)ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) was hammered on Wednesday and it leaves the stock clinging to support. Shares are just above the 200-day moving average and range support near $250.Below $250 and the October low of $243.54 is on the table. Below that and the stock could struggle a bit.If support holds, look for NOW to reclaim the 50-day moving average and rally back up to range resistance near $275. Over $275 and perhaps ServiceNow could retest the backside of its prior uptrend (blue line). Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Workday (WDAY)Thought ServiceNow investors were having a bad day? Just look at Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), which was hit even harder on the day.The 61.8% retracement held WDAY in check on Tuesday, and on Wednesday the 38.2% retracement is acting as bulls' saving grace. Below the 38.2% and Wednesday's low, and the $145 mark could be on the table.If current support at the 38.2% retracement holds, look for WDAY to reclaim the $165 to $166 area. Above that and it will also have to reclaim downtrend resistance.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

And few equities are better at adding ballast to a portfolio than the rock-solid dividend growth stocks in the Dividend Aristocrats - companies in the S&P; 500 that have raised their payouts every year for at least 25 consecutive years.Also, few areas of the market hold up as well in downturns as the health-care sector. Put them together - health-care stocks with multiple decades uninterrupted dividend growth - and investors have a recipe for income and lower risk in their equity portfolios.Six of the elite Dividend Aristocrats can be found in the health-care sector. These stocks, most of which are household names, have hiked their payouts for anywhere from 34 to 57 consecutive years. That's dividend growth an income investor can count on.For dividend growth and defense, take a closer look at these six health-care Dividend Aristocrats.

2019-09-23	2019-09-23 11:22:22	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	3 Big Stock Charts for Monday: MSCI, Macerich and Abbott Laboratories	The market tried to work its way back into a bullish groove and end the week on a high note, but to no avail. By the time Friday's closing bell rang, the S&P 500 was 0.49% lower than Thursday's last trade. The true direction of the undertow remains in question.Source: Shutterstock Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) did more than its fair share of the damage, tumbling more than 5% after CEO Reed Hastings conceded looming competition from Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and others would be impressively tough. At the other end of the spectrum, though not by enough, was Fitbit (NYSE:FIT). The fitness tracker ticker jumped more than 11% on a rumor that it was considering selling itself to a so-far-unnamed suitor.Headed into the new trading week, it's the stock charts of MSCI (NYSE:MSCI), Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) and Macerich (NYSE:MAC) that are of the most interest. Here's why, and what's apt to be next.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Macerich (MAC)Macerich shares have been losing ground for a couple of years now, with seemingly no end in sight. Although up for the past few weeks, that move didn't necessarily snap the losing streak.  * 7 Worst Stocks in the S&P 500 in 2019 Except, that gain may have set the stage for a recovery effort. After such a prolonged selloff, the stock's certainly ripe for a rebound. And, another missing link has finally materialized. Fortunately, the lines in the sand have become very clear.  Click to Enlarge • The most important of those lines is the one that has steered MAC stock lower since the August-2018 peak, marked as a yellow dashed line on both stock charts.• The action over the course of the past month exhibits many of the clues of a reversal. Namely, volume swelled into the bottom from last month, and the turnaround has taken shape on even higher volume. It's a sign of a pivot from a net-selling to a net-buying environment.• Even if the falling resistance line is broken, notice the gray 100-day moving average line could still bring a quick end to that effort. It needs to be cleared as well. Abbott Laboratories (ABT)The past couple of months haven't been especially good ones for Abbott Laboratories shareholders. After an incredibly bullish summer following a great start to the new year, the stock has fallen back.That selloff is part of a well-established pattern, though, and that pattern has been amazingly well defined by straight support and resistance lines. ABT stock is somewhat in limbo right now, trapped between various floors and ceilings. Whether you want to buy it or short it depends on what happens next, and your intended timeframe.  Click to Enlarge • There are two sets of support and resistance levels. The lesser ones are marked as yellow lines on both stock charts, while the bigger ones are plotted in light blue.• Though edging lower, the gray 100-day moving average line has thus far held up as a support level, much like it did back in May.• The white 200-day moving average line is also in play here, so if the short-term, yellow floor that's guided Abbott to higher lows since the end of last year doesn't hold up, ABT stock doesn't necessarily have to fall all the way back to the mid-$70's. MSCI (MSCI)Finally, although MSCI looked (and was) unstoppable through the first half of the year, the rally was stopped cold as the second half began. It didn't slip over the edge of the cliff though, so to speak, until last week -- and Friday in particular -- when a sizeable stumble dragged shares below a trio of key moving average lines. Those same moving averages, in fact, also dished out sell signals of their own.  Click to Enlarge • The divergence of those three moving average lines that started to take shape in February has not only ended, the convergence is starting to become a divergence again … in the other direction.• Take a close look at the daily volume bars, and the red, bearish ones in particular. They've become decidedly taller than average since July, and continue to rise.• Zooming out to the weekly chart of MSCI stock makes clear just how overextended this off-the-radar financial services was. It also illustrates how the gray 100-day moving average line has been a make-or-break level in the past … the white 200-day moving average line as well, although less so.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-17	2019-07-17 19:41:03	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	5 Top Stock Trades for Thursday: TSLA, GLD, ABT	U.S. stock indices were again quiet on Wednesday, as we begin to chip away at the tip of the earnings iceberg. We're mostly delving through the banks right now, but will have tech and other industries beginning soon. Let's look at a few top stock trades.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Tesla  Click to EnlargeTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has been moving favorably, working on its seventh straight week of gains. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's getting into a very key area though, the $250 to $260 zone. This was prior range support for years, buoying Tesla stock on each test. Back in May, the stock plunged below this mark, rebounded the next week and failed to reclaim it.     * 4 Retail Stocks to Buy in Time for the Back-to-School Rush This is all shown via the purple arrow on the chart and shows when an area shifts from support to resistance. Now back in this area, it's vital for TSLA stock to reclaim this range level in order to keep the rally alive. Those who bought Tesla sub-$200 as a trade may consider booking some profits here. Should shares push through, look for a rally up to the 200-week moving average, currently at $273. On a pullback, see that the 10-week holds as support. I wouldn't want to see Tesla below $240.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Abbott Labs  Click to EnlargeAbbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) hit new highs after the company reported earnings. However, the stock is not moving as robustly as one might have expected. I want to see ABT stock hold $85 on the downside and see if it can push up to channel resistance on the upside.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Gold  Click to EnlargeThe move has been years in the making, but the SPDR Gold ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD) is starting to make some waves. The iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SLV) has been trading well too, but isn't putting together the kind of chart GLD is. Above is a long-term weekly chart. With GLD over the $128 to $130 area, it's in breakout mode. While shares are putting in a nice bull flag setup after a huge burst higher in June, we absolutely need to see prior resistance hold as support. A rate cut should help fuel a rally for gold, although the market is surely starting to price in such an event. Over $135.55 sends GLD even higher. A pullback to $130 or the 10-day moving average that holds as support may be a buy-the-dip opportunity.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Invitae  Click to EnlargeShares of Invitae (NASDAQ:NVTA) took off Wednesday, rallying up toward $24 at one point in the day. Citron Research said it had a position in the name and is using a $100 price target. We've been telling InvestorPlace readers for months that we love this name. Today's action came with perfect timing. On Twitter on Tuesday, we pointed out that NVTA stock broke below the 20-day moving average, but reclaimed this mark by the close. That was very constructive action, while Wednesday's action has been downright impressive. The action is similar to what we saw last month, where shares broke below the 20-day, reclaimed it in the same session, then went on a monster run over the next few days. I'm not sure that history repeats, but investors are hopeful that it will. Let's see if NVTA can push through $24 to $24.50. If it can, $26+ could be in the cards.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Teva Pharmaceutical  Click to EnlargeShares of Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) are taking it on the chin. The stock is down 11% in just three days and more than 20% from its highs earlier this month.   * 8 Penny Stocks That Have Fallen From Grace The stock hit new 52-week lows on the move and is threatening to fall below $8 support. Longs with a strong stomach can play against Wednesday's lows, but Teva has not been a great one to own. A break below $8 could accelerate the selling pressure. A rally could bring Teva back up to its 20-day moving average. Above that and $10 is possible. Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-06-25	2019-06-25 13:10:40	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Allergan Is a $63 Billion Botox Job for AbbVie	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When the maker of the top-selling arthritis drug says it’s buying a leader in anti-wrinkle treatments, you’d be forgiven if your initial response to the news was that it seems like a match made in heaven. But take a closer look, and AbbVie Inc.’s $63 billion purchase of Botox maker Allergan Plc isn’t such a perfect fit. AbbVie is desperate for diversification as sales of its $19 billion arthritis blockbuster Humira begin to slow; in Allergan, it has the  opportunity acquire a rival at a relative bargain. Even at a 45% premium to Allergan’s closing share price Monday, AbbVie is paying a fraction of what the drugmaker was worth just a couple of years ago, and Botox is still growing.The deal is projected to net big synergies: AbbVie projects cost savings from the combination will plump up its bottom line by $2 billion within three years. But AbbVie's most significant problem isn't the next few years. It's figuring out how to grow when Humira's sales take a real dive starting in 2023. It’s not clear that Allergan will be much help there, and the early reaction from AbbVie shareholders suggests they have doubts:The long-term outlook for Botox is a matter of debate. The toxin, which is used to both smooth wrinkles and treat migraines, has impressive brand recognition and a solid grip on the market. But a cheaper competitor on the market from Evolus Inc. was recently approved, and another from Revance Inc. has produced compelling data and is on the way.On top of that, there’s a new class of preventative migraine drugs on the market, which could pressure Botox’s market share from a different angle. Botox has held up so far. But these pressures are only going to increase over time, and its best days of growth are likely in the past. There’s a decent chance that its sales will flatten just as Humira’s begin to crater when biosimilar copycats hit the U.S. market in 2023.Then there’s the question of what AbbVie gets outside of Botox from Allergan’s pharmaceutical business. The fit is questionable; AbbVie is principally focused on cancer and drugs for inflammatory conditions like arthritis. Allergan doesn’t add anything significant there. So is the quality. Aging products, questionable deals, and research failures have battered Allergan’s stock to the point where investors have been calling for a breakup of the company or a change in management. Allergan has a few growing marketed products, including gastrointestinal drug Linzess and anti-psychotic treatment Vraylar. But there’s little in its late-stage development pipeline to get excited about, especially given its poor recent track record in R&D. Allergan adds little in the way of the research capability required to discover new medicines, and that’s by design. The company has deliberately focused on acquiring assets that others have developed. AbbVie’s acquisition track record since it separated from Abbott Laboratories in 2013 is shaky. Pharmacyclics Inc. netted it half of a good cancer drug at a bruising price, and its $5.8 billion acquisition of Stemcentrx Inc. looks like a complete flop. The company’s biggest deal yet may not improve its reputation.To contact the author of this story: Max Nisen at mnisen@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

The new line, discussed exclusively with Reuters, will focus on smaller provincial cities, often in China's western provinces, where greater shipping distances and lower incomes can make some imported brand goods unaffordable, though wealth there is growing.

2019-04-16	2019-04-16 11:33:04	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Is AbbVie Stock An Undiscovered Cannabis Play Waiting For Some Attention?	The market opportunity for cannabis is enormous. According to Grand View Research, the spending is expected to hit a staggering $146.4 billion in the U.S. by the end of 2025.Nowadays there are more publicly traded companies to play this megatrend, including names like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON), and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY). Beyond these stocks' extreme volatility, they also fetch sky-high valuations, with price-to-sales multiples often well over 50x.So, is there way to get exposure to the cannabis opportunity -- but not take on too much risk? Interestingly enough, there is one such stock to consider: AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). It's a company that rarely pops up on many people's radar screen when it comes to cannabis. After all, it's one of the world's largest traditional pharma operators, with roots going back to 1888. Keep in mind that ABBV stock was spun-off from Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in 2013.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo what does ABBV stock have to do with cannabis? Well, consider that the company has a drug on the market, called Marinol. It is based on a compound known as dronabinol, a synthetic form of THC, which is a natural part of the marijuana plant (that is, cannabis sativa). This is what activates the &quot;high.&quot;  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Now Marinol has proven to be effective in dealing with the symptoms of a host of terrible diseases. For example, it helps deal with the nausea from chemotherapy and the weight problems resulting from those who suffer from AIDS.Granted, Marinol is not a blockbuster drug. But then again, it does show the promise of cannabis as a treatment. More importantly, as for AbbVie stock, the drug is an indication of the company's ability to push innovation with alternative treatments. In other words, it would not be a surprise that it will go on to leverage this experience to look at more treatments.What's more, the use of cannabis for medical purposes is certainly a major opportunity. There are already 41 countries that allow for this, whether on a federal or state level. Bottom Line on AbbVie StockGranted, it would not be a good idea to invest in AbbVie stock just because it has a cannabis drug. To be sure, as seen with the latest earnings report, the company does have some problems as it issued disappointing guidance. Since early this year, ABBV stock has sunk from $91 to $81.The nagging issue is the company's most important drug, Humira (this is for the treatment of arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis). For the most part, the growth is slowing. And yes, there are worries about when the U.S. patent protection comes off in 2023.  * 8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off Despite all this, I still think there is a bullish case for AbbVie stock. One, the company has a decent roster of drug candidates that could move the needle -- and help make up for a shortfall in Humira. For example, it has several immunology treatments (risankizumab and upadacitinib) that should hit the markets this year. Interestingly enough, when it comes to the pipeline, AbbVie has lots of potential with the cancer market. To this end, its drug Imbruvica is likely to spin-off various treatments for the category.And who knows, perhaps there could be potential from cannabis as well? I think so.In the meantime, AbbVie stock sports a dirt-cheap valuation, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at only 8.6x. Oh, and the dividend is at 5.15%, making it one of the highest among the major pharma companies.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-04-15	2019-04-15 12:15:44	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	The Future Keeps Looking Better and Better for BAX Stock	Good news continues to benefit Baxter International (NYSE:BAX) stock. The Deerfield, Illinois-based medical equipment company received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its latest version of Floseal. Floseal already led the industry among blood-clotting solutions, so how it affects BAX stock remains unclear.Source: Shutterstock However, with a demographic trend that continues to favor all things healthcare, it serves as yet another reason to buy Baxter International stock. Baxter Improves FlosealBaxter just received approval from the FDA for its next generation of its Floseal Hemostatic Matrix. The company designed Floseal to stop bleeding during surgeries when more conventional procedures fail. The company reduced both the components and the steps to prepare by 20% in this latest version.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Marijuana Companies: Which Pot Stocks Should You Buy? Floseal has become a success for Baxter. Despite its higher price, it comes out ahead of Surgiflo, the competing product produced by Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) Ethicon. The Bulls and BAX stockInterestingly, despite the compelling benefits Floseal appears to offer, it may not affect BAX significantly. The Advanced Surgery division which produces Floseal remains one of the company's smaller divisions. The Renal Care, Medication Delivery, Pharmaceuticals, and Clinical Nutrition divisions all generate more revenue for the company.Moreover, the slow, steady increases in BAX began 3.5 years ago. It traded at just under $33 per share in the fall of 2015. Today, it has risen to over $79 per share. This places it just shy of its all-time high of $82.25 per share where it peaked last month.BAX also continues a pace of steady profit growth, which should rise to double-digit levels next year. Moreover, it trades at a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 21.3. This places its multiple close to long-term averages. It also makes it a cheaper stock than another peer, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) Medicare Is Key for BAXIn most cases, I would call a stock with such metrics a hold. However, demographics provide a catalyst that will help BAX for now even if it failed to improve its products. The baby boom generation continues to age into Medicare at a rapid pace. A similar trend has appeared in other countries. This population's need for more medical care almost guarantees an increase in profits for BAX over the next few years.The peak of the baby boom occurred in 1957. Hence, age-ins to Medicare will peak 65 years after that year, meaning 2022. For this reason, I would expect at least three more years of a rising BAX.This trend has already helped take the financials higher. Both revenue and dividends for BAX have risen every year since 2016. The 0.95% yield on the dividend probably will not motivate investors to buy. However, the annual increases for the payout likely reflect the bullish sentiment. The Bottom Line on BAX StockAlthough a better Floseal should bring improved revenues to Baxter, demographics will continue to serve as the driving force behind BAX. As the leading product for blood clotting, the enhanced version of Floseal should help ensure that Baxter maintains its lead over Ethicon's Surgiflo.Still, the millions of baby boomers entering Medicare will more than likely remain the number one reason to buy BAX stock. With a greater need for care and the backing behind Medicare to pay, Baxter will benefit from this growing book of business for years to come.The market will always welcome product improvements. Despite this benefit, the growth in BAX will remain tied primarily to Medicare age-ins for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-03-19	2019-03-19 14:21:36	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Why You Should Buy ABBV Stock for Income and Value	Today, I'd like to discuss the outlook for AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), the $116-billion-market-cap biopharmaceutical stock, whose shares have been in a downtrend for almost a year and have especially been hammered following its earning report of Jan. 25.Source: Shutterstock   * Top 7 Service Sector Stocks That Will Pay You to Own Them There could be further price volatility and weakness in the ABBV stock price in the coming weeks, pushing it toward the low-$70's or even mid-$60's level. However, it is a company with robust growth prospects and respectable dividends that may deserve a place in a diversified portfolio.Therefore, if you already own AbbVie shares, you might want to hold your position. That said, within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 5-7% below the current price point. Expect nearer-term trading to be choppy at best.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you are an experienced investor in the options market, you may want to protect your portfolio with a covered call or possibly a put option spread with a 3-month time horizon. If you do not yet hold ABBV, you may want to wait several weeks to buy into the stock at the next dip.With all of that in mind, here's a deeper look into at AbbVie stock. A Hiccup in the Robust Fundamental StoryIn 2013, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) spun off its research-based pharmaceuticals business, creating AbbVie, an independent biopharmaceutical company. Abbott decided to retain the branded generic pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, medical devices and nutrition.Meanwhile, AbbVie took control of the development and commercialization of a range of brands, including Humira, its flagship drug used to treat autoimmune diseases, Imbruvica, which differentiates between cancer cells and regular cells, and Synthroid, a replacement for a hormone normally produced by the thyroid gland.The company's financials and growth metrics over the past five years have been impressive and ABBV was in a strong financial position heading into 2019, with hopes of a higher share price during the first quarter.However, in January, AbbVie's fourth-quarter earnings release weighed heavily on the stock. For starters, the company missed the consensus on revenue. Its earnings per share of $1.90 was below the expected number of $1.94. The next day, the stock fell by 6% and that decline has intensified over the past two months.ABBV's quarterly report also showed that the international sales of Humira fell by almost 15% year over year, mostly as a result of 'biosimilar' competition in Europe, which makes up three-quarters of the overseas Humira business. In October 2018, its patent in the European Union (E.U) expired.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refers to biosimilars as &quot;highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product … [that has] no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and effectiveness.&quot; Although Wall Street had already known about this sales decline in Europe, when coupled with the other question marks in the earnings report, it was enough to increase the selling pressure on the stock.It is also possible that investors got worried about the potential fall in Humira revenue when the drug comes off patent in 2023 in the U.S. It is important to emphasize that AbbVie's revenue from the drug will not decline to nothing when the biosimilars hit the market in 2023. What will most likely happen is that as the company's pricing power decreases, the revenue will also gradually decline.Therefore, many analysts feel that ABBV shares offer value and that any bad news that is specific to Humira is already baked into the stock price. Value PlayWhen markets penalize biopharma stocks, it can take some time for them to recover.  However, for patient long-term investors, the returns can be significant -- especially when the company boasts several other current drugs, as well promising ones in the pipeline.At present, AbbVie's other major products include:  * AndroGel, a testosterone replacement therapy.  * Creon, a pancreatic enzyme therapy to treat exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.  * Duopa and Duodopa, gels to treat Parkinson's disease.  * Viekira Pak, which treats chronic hepatitis C.  * Zinbryta, to treat multiple sclerosis.Analysts are also expecting a slew of new products in 2020, such as next-generation immunology drugs.  These drugs and others that are being developed and commercialized, highlight how impressive the potential growth story could be in the next few years.ABBV trades at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.  This number is rather modest when compared with the P/E ratios of  several competitors, including AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) with a P/E of 49.9, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) with a P/E of 25.2, and Merck (NYSE:MRK) with a P/E of 34.8. Reinvesting the Sweet Dividend Yield of ABBV stockIncome investors know that they can compound their returns through reinvesting dividends from high-yielding shares. AbbVie also offers investors a healthy dividend yield of about 5.4%, another reason why I believe the stock belongs in a capital-growth portfolio.Since its spin-off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013, ABBV has increased dividends every year -- a trend that is likely to continue. The next dividend payment is scheduled for May 15, 2019, with an ex-dividend date of April 12.It would not be wrong to call AbbVie a cashflow machine; as of Dec. 31, the company had a free cash flow of $3.27 billion. This strength not only gives shareholders conviction that the dividends are safe, but also provides the company with enough flexibility to, for example, make acquisitions to offset any further Humira revenue decline (especially in the U.S. when the drug comes off patent in 2023). The Bottom Line on AbbVie StockLike most biopharma stocks, AbbVie is a high-momentum stock. In other words, when the broader markets go up or when the company's earnings beat expectations, both investors and momentum traders tend to hit the &quot;buy&quot; button fast, expecting superior gains within days or weeks.However, if markets suffer a decline or if the company cannot keep up with the rising expectations, investors' risk appetite decreases fast and these stocks can fall much harder than less volatile stocks.  * 7 Financial Stocks to Invest In Today The market has punished Abbvie stock since the start of the year. The stock may continue to struggle through much of 2019. However, patient ABBV bulls will probably be proven right to believe in the management's commitment to create shareholder value and to further grow the company both organically and through acquisitions. In the meantime, they can continue to collect high dividends.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-11	2019-02-11 20:24:13	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	5 High-Growth Stocks Undervalued by the Market	High-growth stocks draw the lion's share of the attention in financial media. These securities usually show higher levels of volatility and often represent the future of the American economy. Today, these equities often revolve around new technologies like AI, VR and the Internet of Things (IoT).However, concepts that we might consider &quot;new again&quot; also draw this interest. Due to decades of suppression, cannabis has become one of these areas. Also, judging by the performance of Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), even equities revolving around fast food can turn into high-growth stocks with the right approach.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months As one might expect, the overwhelming majority of these stocks carry the high P/E ratio that goes along with elevated growth. However, not all prospective buyers want that level of risk. Fortunately, a few high-growth stocks also fall into the &quot;undervalued stocks&quot; category. The following equities constitute some of the best stocks for combining growth with value:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Shutterstock  AbbVie (ABBV)Drug equities don't often make lists of high-growth stocks. AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) formed in 2013 when it split from Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). It constitutes what was once Abbott's pharma division.ABBV stock has suffered in recent months as its old blockbuster drug, Humira, faces patent expirations in many countries. However, AbbVie's drug pipeline has received favorable reviews. For this reason, most analysts believe that a new drug or a combination of future best sellers will more than replace the income lost from generic versions of Humira.Still, due to the uncertainty, ABBV stock trades at only 8.4 times forward earnings. However, even with a single-digit P/E ratio, Wall Street predicts 10.6% profit growth for 2019. They also believe the average increase will come in at almost 13.4% per year over the next five years.ABBV also offers one key benefit stemming from its former association with Abbott -- dividend aristocrat status. Walking away from its 46-year streak of payout hikes would put ABBV stock at risk. Hence, one can assume the increases will continue. Their board also approved a 40% increase in 2018 and a 19% hike for this year. Given the pressure to raise dividend payments every year, this is a remarkable show of confidence. Moreover, thanks to a lower stock price and higher dividends, the yield now stands at 5.4%.Investing in ABBV stock now involves some faith. However, with a single-digit P/E, double-digit profit growth, and a generous, growing dividend, investors could receive tremendous rewards for believing.Source: Apple  Apple (AAPL)With its $800 billion market cap and massive slide last fall, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might seem like a strange choice for a high-growth stocks list. Indeed, both the stock and the earnings projection saw a considerable move lower as iPhone sales fell well short of initial estimates. Also, laws of mathematics weigh on growth. An increase in AAPL's market cap of just 10% would mean $80 billion in growth, eight times the minimum size of a large-cap stock.However, as smartphone prices fall, Apple is working to make itself less iPhone-dependent. It no longer reports iPhone unit sales. Moreover, moves into services and healthcare should bring new sources of revenue.Due to tepid iPhone sales, profit growth for the year will come in at only 0.3%. But it should reclaim its high-growth status assuming the predicted 11.5% growth (and higher in the years after) comes to pass.  * 7 Bank Stocks to Buy After the BB&T-Suntrust Mega-Merger AAPL stock may suffer for a time as it works to diversify sales away from the iPhone. However, with its enormous cash hoard and its ability to pioneer new technologies, AAPL stock will remain a solid growth story as it works to reclaim its $1 trillion market cap.Source: Shutterstock  CannTrust (CNTTF)I normally would not place an equity with a 51.5 trailing P/E ratio in the &quot;cheap&quot; category, but compared to peers in the cannabis space, CannTrust (OTCMKTS:CNTTF) remains inexpensive. Although one can place almost every marijuana equity in the &quot;high-growth stocks&quot; category right now, CannTrust stands out with its consistent profitability.For those concerned about the OTC listing, CannTrust applied to trade on the NYSE last month. Once that listing occurs, more traders can buy it, so it should see some increase at that time.As most know, the Canadian marijuana boom came to an abrupt end in October when the product gained full legal status in Canada. However, legalization of one form of cannabis, hemp, has reignited this boom south of the Canadian border. The equities of larger peers such as Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) have already recovered most of the losses which occurred following legalization in Canada. CNTTF stock has also risen by more than 60% from its December low.Even if full legal status does not come soon, both hemp and CBD-related products alone should allow for massive growth across the U.S. With its specialty in cannabis oils, CannTrust should benefit. The company also expanded into Europe by becoming the first and only foreign seller of cannabis oil in Denmark beginning in October.At this moment, most cannabis equities could be described as high-growth stocks. However, with its relatively low P/E, its focus on cannabis oil, and the move to the NYSE, CannTrust delivers this growth at a lower risk compared with its key peers.Source: Qualcomm  Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock has suffered in recent years. A long-running legal dispute with Apple has resulted in the exclusion of Qualcomm chips from the later models of the iPhone. This and other legal battles regarding its licensing practices have weighted on QCOM. As a result, the stock trades nearly 40% below a multi-year high last seen in 2014.However, a great deal of anticipation surrounds its 5G-capable Snapdragon 855 chip. Carriers have begun to launch 5G networks, and most expect 5G capable phones to see a wide release beginning later this year. While QCOM's chip will not appear in the iPhone, makers of Android-powered smartphones have shown an interest. As a result, analysts believe that profit increases will again see double-digit increases beginning in 2020. After years of profit declines, Wall Street predicts that annual growth will average 10.7% per year over the next five years. This will occur just as the company's forward P/E ratio falls to around 11.6.QCOM stock has also quietly developed a reputation as a dividend-paying stock. Despite declining profits in past years, Qualcomm has hiked its payout for eight years in a row. As a result of the increases and the lower stock price, the dividend yield has risen to about 4.9%.  * 7 Breakout Stocks In Early 2019 Yes, its dispute with Apple has weighed on the stock. However, thanks to 5G, the company has developed a new source of revenue. Investors can also collect a generous dividend while waiting for 5G to revive QCOM. Thanks to that dividend, QCOM stock should pay off even if it does not pay off in growth.Source: Shutterstock  Spirit (SAVE)Spirit (NYSE:SAVE) has offered value and growth to an industry not known for fostering high-growth stocks: airlines. For decades, Southwest (NYSE:LUV) brought innovation to the industry as its take on air travel brought lower fares, profits, and high-growth to a stagnant, unprofitable industry.Today, Spirit leads that charge. As the leader of the ultra-low-fare segment of the industry, it continues to see massive profit growth and expansion in both domestic and international markets. Spirit has won over price-sensitive customers who will trade perks such as in-flight beverages and carry-on bags for lower costs.Like Southwest, Spirit has depended on one plane type. However, the company now plans to add a type of regional jet to its fleet. This will allow SAVE to bring low fares to smaller markets dominated by legacy carriers.Even without smaller markets, it has already seen growth numbers that shoot toward the stratosphere. Analysts forecast profit growth of 45.7% for 2019. They also believe earnings increases will average above 20% per year for the foreseeable future.Despite this growth, Spirit, like other airlines, has struggled to achieve higher P/E ratios. This may explain why its multiple is only slightly higher than slower-growth airlines such as American (NASDAQ:AAL) or Delta (NYSE:DAL). SAVE's forward P/E currently stands at around 9.6.Admittedly, few gravitate to airlines when looking for cheap, high-growth stocks. However, the massive profit growth and continuous expansion show that Spirit has become the king of the ultra-low-fare airline sector. Driven by small markets and foreign expansion, profits should continue to climb.As of this writing, Will Healy is long ABBV and CNTTF stock. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

2019-01-23	2019-01-23 21:42:28	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	Abbott Labs (ABT) Stock Slips Despite Solid Q4 Earnings	"Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) reported its latest quarterly earnings results early in the day Wednesday, which came were in line with Wall Street's expectations, but the company's stock declined during regular trading hours and after the bell.

The Chicago-based health care company said that for its fourth quarter of its fiscal 2018, it brought in net income of $654 million, topping the company's loss during the same period a year ago. This amounted to roughly 37 cents per share, or 81 cents per share when adjusting for nonrecurring costs and discontinued operations.

The results were in line with the Wall Street consensus estimate, which called for adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share, according to data compiled by 10 analysts who were surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Abbott Labs added that the company's revenue for the period tallied up to $7.77 billion, which was below Wall Street's guidance.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Seven analysts who were surveyed by Zacks were calling for sales of $7.79 billion. For its fiscal 2018, the company's profit was $2.37 billion, or $1.33 per share, while Abbott Labs' revenue came in at $30.58 billion.

For its first quarter of its fiscal 2019, the company projects earnings of 60 cents to 62 cents per share. Plus, the company sees its fiscal 2019 earnings as being somewhere in the range of $3.15 to $3.25 per share.

ABT stock is down more than 2.2% on Wednesday following the company's results. Shares were down an additional 1% after the bell.

### Must-See Stock Charts #1: IBM

Shares of IBM (NYSE:IBM) are roaring higher after beating estimates and providing better-than-expected guidance. The stock is up 8.5% on the day and hitting multi-month highs as a result.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The question is, can IBM continue the momentum?

  * 5 Terrific Tech Stocks That Will Make You Forget About FANG 



When we're talking about a low-growth name like IBM, it's hard to get too excited about chasing it up over 8%. Not to mention that IBM is up four weeks in a row before this week's move.

Near $110, IBM had an attractive risk/reward. Up near $133 though and it's a different story. Right now it's kind of in no man's land. If it can power through the 50-week and 200-week moving averages then it could challenge downtrend resistance near $145 to $150.

On the downside, I want to see the 10-week moving average near $120 hold as support. If it does, bulls might consider getting long near this level.

Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) shares are down 2% after the company reported in-line earnings results and missed on revenue expectations. Overall, the trend has been higher but it's been a choppy ride the last few months.

As long as shares stay above its 50-day and 21-day moving averages and/or uptrend support (blue line) then the bulls are likely okay. Below these marks and ABT will likely pay a visit to the 200-day. If it can push over this $71 to $72 level, ABT could challenge its highs just over $74.

### Must-See Stock Charts #3: Papa John's

Shares are up over 7% on the day as Papa John's Pizza (NYSE:PZZA) is reportedly receiving some takeover interest. While the news is resulting in a nice pop, PZZA stock is similar to IBM in that it's somewhat in no man's land here.

Technically, it could continue to push up to its 50-day moving average and perhaps beyond, up to its 200-day moving average. Who wants to short a name that's a possible takeover target? Not me. And maybe that will help fuel some of the squeeze higher.

That said, buyers are a little late to the game if they weren't in today. Look to see if PZZA pulls back and consolidates below its prior range or if it rallies into moving average resistance. On the longer term charts, I would expect some resistance near $47.50 to $50 as well.

### Must-See Stock Charts #4: Starbucks

Despite the recent pullback, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been trading well lately. So have these other four. SBUX tried but failed to breakout on Tuesday but is making its move again on Wednesday.

It's encouraging to see Starbucks showing relative strength at a time where the markets have been struggling. It makes me think that if we get some bullish action in the indices, Starbucks can run.

Seeing which stocks are doing well when the market is doing bad is always worth taking note of. It doesn't mean they are guaranteed to breakout, but it improves the odds. If it does, look for a possible run to $70.

Keep in mind SBUX has earnings Thursday evening.

### Must-See Stock Charts #5: Disney

It admittedly lacks some conviction here on the charts, but it's encouraging to see Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock back up above prior downtrend resistance. This level kept Disney in check for years -- so to see it hovering just above it now is encouraging.

2019-01-22	2019-01-22 14:45:18	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	All Signals Are Positive for Buying Abbott Laboratories	"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stock rose steadily in the last year and is up around 20% in that time. Though shares hover near yearly highs, thanks to a quick bounce from $66 to $71.42 recently, biotech investors should still consider investing in this company. Last quarter's strong results, plus a recent dividend hike, signal a healthy 2019 year for this medical appliance and equipment firm.

Abbott Laboratories will report Q4 results on Jan. 23 that will likely repeat Q3 2018 results, which were posted last October. The firm reported sales of $7.7 billion, up 7.8% on an organic basis. Since divesting its Abbott Medical Optics (&quot;AMO&quot;) and integrating St. Jude Medical vascular business, it is more focused on heart and diabetic machines. Diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition, and established pharmaceuticals all grew in the healthy single digits.

### Full-Year 2018 Forecast for ABT Stock

Abbott forecast earnings of $2.87 to $2.89 (adjusted), reflecting growth of 15%. It owes its growth to developments in its medical devices. For example, the U.S. approved the FreeStyle Libre 14-day system, so sales should start adding to results. FreeStyle Libre 2 system and High Sensitive Troponin, available in Europe, will bring healthy geographic diversification to its revenue.

On Dec. 16, 2018, Abbott declared a 32-cent a share quarterly dividend. This increase from 28-cents a share, or up 14.3%, gives investors a forward yield of 1.8%. This is below that of Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), at 3.27%, Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK), at 2.9%, or Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), at 3.39%. Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) has a comparable dividend yield of 2.29%. Despite dividend yields below that of comparable medical firms, this is still a bullish signal.

Management is demonstrating its confidence in future cash flow growth and rewarding shareholders with income. Plus, the firm pays a higher dividend yield than the bottom 25% of dividend payers in the U.S. (according to simplywall.st).

### Abbott Balance Sheet Analysis

Abbott's net worth increased in 2017 to $31.5 billion, but debt also rose, too, to $23.8 billion. This is due to the St. Jude Medical acquisition.

Markets do not seem to care about the higher debt because its long term, the debt/equity ratio is only 0.62X, according to MacroTrends. In the drug space, Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC) has a debt/equity of nearly 8x while Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ:MYL) is at 1.2X.

The point here is that Abbot can handle the debt due to its healthy debt coverage. Its Operating cash flow of 26% exceeds its over 20% of total debt. Interest payment on the debt is covered by 4.8 times its EBIT.

Abbott Laboratories debt levels increased from merger and acquisition activities. (Source: https://simplywall.st)

### Outlook for ABT Stock

Synergies from the integration of Abbott's St Jude unit will save on costs. Because management puts an emphasis on improving its underlying gross margin, look for the unit to keep performing better and adding more to profits.

The Alere unit, which will bring in $2 billion in revenue for fiscal 2018, will add positively to profits. Last year, Abbott stabilized and integrated the business. With that activity complete, it may concentrate on growing the business. As it happened that the strong flu season will benefit results, sustaining growth will depend on new product introductions from the unit.

Based on the six analysts covering ABT stock, the average price target is $79.33, representing upside of 11%. Investors may build a bearish to neutral 10-year DCF Revenue Exit model that assumes revenue slowing in the single digits. Even in that scenario, the model from finbox.io would still suggest a fair value of $73, not far from the recent stock price of ABT.

Abbott put a priority on its dividends over debt repayment. Its businesses are growing steadily and the product list is getting bigger. Cash flow growth will let the company meet its dividend payment obligations while paring debt levels over the long-term.

ABT stock is suitable for income investors who want to own a growing medical appliances firm at a reasonable price.

As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-16	2019-01-16 20:04:03	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	3 Healthcare Stocks That Will Keep Your Portfolio Healthy	"Healthcare stocks cover a wide range of equities. Pharmaceuticals, equipment providers, insurers, pharmacies, technology, and even healthcare-related real estate investment trusts (REIT) can all fall under this category.

However, these companies all benefit from the same trends. The share of healthcare in the overall U.S. economy continues to grow. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that healthcare encompasses about 17.9% of the U.S. economy. Moreover, with an estimated 10,000 baby boomers aging into Medicare a day, the pressure on limited healthcare resources continues to mount.

  * 7 Oversold Small-Cap Stocks With Massive Profit Growth 



While this can mean pain for the healthcare consumer, it can also bring benefit to those who invest in healthcare. With more of the baby boom generation on Medicare, a larger percentage of the population benefits from a healthcare subsidy. This gives a noticeable boost to healthcare stocks. Here are three that could help you benefit from this trend.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### AbbVie (ABBV)

Source: Shutterstock 

Few healthcare stocks find themselves in a better position for both income and growth potential than AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) created AbbVie when it spun off its pharmaceutical division in 2013. After a growth spurt in 2017, ABBV fell as concerns about patent expirations on its blockbuster drug Humira weighed on the stock. Today it trades at about 30% below its 52-week high.

However, ABBV stock also looks well-positioned to make a comeback. The Humira-driven swoon in ABBV has taken the forward P/E ratio to around 9.8. This comes in well below the average P/E of 18.2 over the last five years. Moreover, Evaluate Pharma ranks AbbVie's drug pipeline as second-best in the industry for value creation. Also, the company has time to transition to its next high-revenue drug. It will hold a patent on Humira in the U.S. until at least 2022. Analysts also do not seem worried as they predict profit growth of almost 10% per year through at least 2021.

Furthermore, Wall Street considers AbbVie a dividend aristocrat due to its previous ties to Abbott. As a result, the company faces tremendous pressure to increase its dividend annually. AbbVie increased its payout from $3.59 per share to $4.28 per share this year. Hence, despite a generous yield of almost 4.9%, investors can probably expect annual increases in future years.

Also, I see this massive dividend increase as a vote of confidence in itself. Couple that with the low P/E and the high ratings that AbbVie's drug pipeline has received, and ABBV should be one of the few healthcare stocks which will outperform in both the growth and income categories.

### Teladoc Health (TDOC)

Source:  MayApps207 via WikiMedia 

Buying Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) amounts to buying into the future of healthcare. Without a doubt, the 17.9% of the economy that healthcare now consumes weighs heavily on family budgets. Teladoc allows patients to see a licensed doctor at any time via a PC or mobile device, reducing the need to take time off from work. It also saves money as visits can run as low as $40.

Telehealth has only begun to realize its potential. Analysts estimate telehealth can handle about one-third of the 1.25 billion office visits that take place each year in the U.S. With Teladoc handling an estimated two million visits in 2018, the company still covers less than 1% of its potential market.

Teladoc also shows that it can acquire the right partners to improve its quality and reach more patients. It widened its competitive moat by investing in diagnostic capabilities with a takeover of Best Doctors. It also partnered with CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) to provide care to its customers. Additionally, it boosted its offshore footprint by buying Advance Medical. Advance Medical was the leading telehealth provider outside the U.S. before TDOC purchased the company.

Investors should note that TDOC remains expensive. Its price in the $55 per share range places it at around 9.3 times sales. Still, it has fallen almost 40% from its October high. Also, revenue grew by 78% in 2018. Although that growth will fall over time, analysts estimate that the company will turn profitable in 2021.

  * 10 Growth Stocks With the Future Written All Over Them 



Teladoc remains one of the more speculative healthcare stocks. However, with a $3.8 billion market cap, and a majority market share in a business that has reached less than one percent of its full potential, Teladoc could become one of the best stocks in healthcare.

### Dentsply Sirona  (XRAY)

An aging population creates an increasing need for dental care and the equipment provided by Dentsply Sirona (NASDAQ:XRAY). As the ticker implies, Dentsply manufactures dental imaging equipment as well as consumable supplies and specialty dental products.

Medicare rarely covers dental needs. However, many consumers place a high value on having a beautiful smile and the ability to chew food. Hence, most customers will spend money on services requiring XRAY's supplies and equipment. This also holds true outside of the U.S. Dentsply Sirona conducts business in over 120 countries. These other countries account for about 65% of the company's revenue.

XRAY stock rose steadily between 2009 and 2018. However, in 2018, the stock lost almost half of its value. By late October, it traded as low as $33.93 per share, a level first seen in 2011. The stock sold off for most of the year on lower-than-expected sales. An impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets in the second quarter hurt earnings. The stock fell by nearly 20% on August 7 following this announcement.

However, management responded with a restructuring plan. While that breeds uncertainty, the forecasts indicate an opportunity for buyers. The forward P/E ratio stands at around 18, well below the five-year average of 28.1. Furthermore, analysts predict 11.2% consensus profit growth this year. They also foresee double-digit profit increases through at least 2021.

XRAY faced a great deal of pain in 2018. Still, the need for dental supplies and equipment will only rise in the coming years. For this reason, the lower multiple and the predicted profit growth should bring about a recovery in Dentsply Sirona.

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is negative 
  * Bearish sentiment is low



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is low for ABT with fewer than 5% of shares on loan. The last change in the short interest score occurred more than 1 month ago and implies that there has been little change in sentiment among investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Negative

The current level displays a negative indicator. ABT credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels for the past 1 year, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

2019-01-11	2019-01-11 20:45:25	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	3 Back-of-the-Shelf Consumer Stocks With Growth and Income	"Many tend to ignore consumer stocks not oriented toward the latest technology. Consumers and investors tend to focus on companies that produce new gadgets or bring the next wave of tech innovation. Many &quot;boring&quot; consumer stocks that have less of a tech focus, however, offer an impressive track record with dividends. This serves as an advantage over a tech industry, which tends to lag the S&P 500 when it comes to offering dividend stocks.

Due in large part to dividends and a loyal customer base, consumer stocks tend to offer stability lacking in some of these more exciting stocks. Also, contrary to popular belief, many of these companies have become innovation leaders.

Although the press may not always report it, these firms often pioneer new products that place them on the cutting edge in their industries.

  * 10 A-Rated Stocks to Buy That The Smart Money Is Piling Into 



The following three companies lead this innovation. They also offer growth rates, valuations and dividend yields that should draw the attention of stock buyers.

Source: Shutterstock 

### AbbVie (ABBV)

Admittedly, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) has made a few of my stock lists. I had hoped not to write about ABBV for that reason. However, when an equity offers an almost single-digit forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, double-digit profit growth and the third-highest dividend yield among dividend aristocrats, I cannot leave it off in good conscience.

ABBV stock trades a perfect storm for buyers. The patent on Humira faces patent expirations across the world. This has inspired a wave of selling in AbbVie. Despite this, analysts believe the company's drug pipeline will keep profits growing at double-digit rates. This has led to a forward PE ratio that stands at about 10.1.

This perfect storm also applies to the firm's payouts. Due to its previous history as part of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), ABBV holds dividend aristocrat status. When a stock hikes its payout for 46 years as AbbVie has, the stock price depends heavily on keeping this streak alive.

Even better, ABBV has not made not offered a token hike in the payout merely to maintain the dividend aristocrat status. AbbVie went further, taking the payout from $2.56 per share in 2017 to $3.59 per share in 2018 to $4.28 per share this year. Approving such hikes when they face intense pressure to raise the payout every year shows a strong belief in its own future.

Considering the low P/E ratio, the profit levels, and the dividend growth amounts, ABBV becomes one of the more obvious choices among consumer stocks.

### Altria Group (MO)

Few consumer stocks reflect resilience better than Altria (NYSE:MO). This year will mark 55 years since the U.S. Surgeon General released their report warning on the dangers of smoking. Amid anti-smoking campaigns, increasing tobacco taxes, and multi-billion dollar legal settlements, MO stock should have sunk into obscurity. Instead, Altria has become an unlikely success story.

Despite the hostile environment for tobacco, the company continues to find opportunity. Currently, it invests in both smokeless tobacco and alcohol. It currently holds a 10.2% stake in Anheuser Busch-InBev (NYSE:BUD), for example. Also, despite legal barriers, it has also turned to the emerging marijuana sector. In late 2018, Altria purchased a 45% stake in Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) for $1.8 billion.

Even with the hostile business environment, MO stock manages to maintain a generous dividend. The current dividend of $3.20 per share yields almost 6.6%. Although MO does not hold dividend aristocrat status, the payout has increased in most years.

As a result, MO stock has long remained a dividend powerhouse. Those who bought the equity in 2000 and reinvested the dividends receive their original investment back every year in dividends alone. The same holds true for those who bought in 1985 and spent or invested the payouts elsewhere.

The company also looks attractive from a valuation and growth perspective. The forward P/E stands at 11.3. Moreover, analysts predict a 7.5% profit growth rate this year. Also, they expect those profit increases to remain in the high-single-digits for years to come. With its successes in related business, and its ability to maintain growth despite strong anti-tobacco sentiment, Altria should continue to stand out among consumer stocks.

### General Mills (GIS)

Despite producing recession-proof products, General Mills (NYSE:GIS) and its direct peers have endured years of struggle. An increasing interest in fresh and organic foods has diminished demand for the packaged foods General Mills has produced. As a result, it has seen both revenue and profits steadily fall over the last few years. This has taken GIS stock to levels first seen in 2012.

However, a turnaround could occur soon. General Mills has begun to pivot to reflect consumer tastes. The company owns brands such as Cascadian Farm, Larabar, and Muir Glen that produce certified organic foods.

Such products have helped revenues and profits turns around. After years of falling numbers, analysts predict a 5.5% increase in profits next year. Revenues have already begun to improve as Wall Street expects a 7.7% increase in sales growth for this year.

Also, due to the years of decline, GIS stock trades at 12.7 forward earnings. Although this would not impress investors in a shrinking business, it begins to appear reasonable with growth returning. Also, with a five-year average P/E of 20.6, investors will likely enjoy a nice gain by waiting for the multiple to return to its long-term average.

Even better for income-oriented investors, the $1.96 per share dividend yields around 4.75%. Since they have achieved a 15-year streak of dividend increases, another payout hike will likely come this year.

Both consumers and investors have waited a long time for packaged food companies to embrace more natural foods. General Mills has finally made that move. With its attractive valuations and dividend yields, GIS stock should find a place among the more attractive high-dividend consumer stocks.

2019-01-07	2019-01-07 15:56:25	ABT	Abbott Laboratories	As Patent Expirations Loom, the Clock Is Ticking on AbbVie Stock	"AbbVie (NASDAQ:ABBV) is basically a one-trick pony. The trick is an immunosuppressant called Humira, prescribed to fight rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions. It's the best-selling drug in the world, bringing in $18.4 billion in 2017, but that might not be sufficient to support the future of AbbVie stock.

While protected against direct competition in the U.S. until 2023, Humira is already facing biosimilars in Europe, as its protections there disappear.

AbbVie has been milking Humira for dividends, $4.28 per year, a yield of 4.76%. The stock looks cheap, at 18 times earnings, and has held up well during the bear market, down just 8.7% over the last six months while the average NASDAQ stock is down nearly 15%.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The question for investors is whether AbbVie stock is the kind of defensive play you want to be making in 2019.

  * 9 A-Rated Safety Stocks for a Grossly Oversold Market 



### AbbVie Stock Shows Signs of Life

Like an aging doyenne who can still dance at the ball, AbbVie's situation still looks good.

Despite a price tag of up to $2,600 per month, Humira continues to sell because it has been approved to treat many diseases. Not just arthritis, but Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis and even the heartbreak of psoriasis are treated with it.

While its U.S. patent expired in 2016, AbbVie has been able to extend its U.S. rights into the next decade through ancillary patents and aggressive lawyering. Rather than ending, its sales are expected to just trend down slowly.

While Europe this year will have biosimilars from privately-held Boehringer Ingelheim, Sandoz, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Samsung Bioepis, Humira's revenues won't be destroyed, only reduced.

AbbVie, which was spun out of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in 2013, has also been building its own drug pipeline, with  new dermatology drugs on the way, as well as anti-cancer drugs. It has a treatment for Hepatitis C, Mavyret, which competes directly with Harvoni from Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD).

### The Long Look at AbbVie Stock

Still, like that old doyenne, AbbVie knows the sunset for Humira is coming. It's like an old oil field. You can frack it, but those wells, too, won't produce forever.

Early in the next decade, AbbVie will be facing a problem similar to the one Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) did early in this decade, when the rights on Lipitor expired in 2011. There are a host of strategies for keeping such drugs alive, in a financial sense, and AbbVie is engaging in, or preparing to engage, in all of them.

But Humira is as dominant as Lipitor once was, with twice the sales of the next largest-selling drug, Celgene's (NASDAQ:CELG) Revlimid, a cancer drug. AbbVie will need several hits to replace Humira, and time is running out.

AbbVie is the big winner in immunosuppressants, originally developed to prevent rejection of new organs but now offered against a host of autoimmune conditions, but as its own experience with Mavyret shows, European regulators and American pharmacy benefit managers have ways to fight back against skyrocketing prices.

The effectiveness of these tools, pitting drug against drug and choosing a formulary based at least partly on price, is going to increase with competition over the coming years and may be a bigger overhang on AbbVie's growth than its patent expiration.

### The Bottom Line on AbbVie Stock

For now, the good times roll on. AbbVie is due to report earnings Jan. 25, expecting sales of $8.36 billion for a 2018 total of $32.8 billion , 16% ahead of 2017's $28.2 billion. Net income of $1.92 per share will bring that total to $6.92 per share for the year.

But, as they say of both athletes and great beauties, Father Time is undefeated. AbbVie still faces a patent cliff, and growing opposition to rising prices. Nothing lasts forever. What works this year may not work next year. Know that before you buy AbbVie stock.

Nielsen is quoted as saying, &quot;this is most likely the largest cartel in the history of the United States.&quot; The victims were consumers and taxpayers, who have been carrying the high cost of overcharges on common antiboitics, blood-pressure medications, arthritis treatments, anxiety pills and more, said the report. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. ADRs  fell 5.7% on the news. Mylan NV was down 4.6%, and Dr. Reddy Labs Ltd  was down 3%. Abbott Labs  was down 1.4% and Pfizer Inc.  was down 1.6%. The S&P 500  was down 1.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down about 2%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9dce84cc-b01d-3630-9bce-2cef4f8061e3/generic-drug-makers-stocks.html?.tsrc=rss

In July 2016, the CyPass Micro-Stent was approved by the FDA to be used along with cataract surgery for patients suffering from mild-to-moderate primary open-angle glaucoma.  The reduced competition for Glaukos’ glaucoma devices caused Robbie Marcus, a JPMorgan Chase analyst, to increase the company’s target price to $75, which implies an upside potential of ~19.3%—compared to the company’s last closing price.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b4a2f823-83e9-31ef-93b8-950e1bbeccb5/glaukos-stock-rose-40.3%25-on.html?.tsrc=rss
