2021-02-19	2021-02-19 16:21:55	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Despite Risks, Star Peak Energy Looks Poised to Be a Long-Term Winner	Star Peak Energy (NYSE:STPK) is a SPAC that has agreed to merge with Stem, a “smart energy” company which looks to be very well-positioned for the ongoing energy revolution. Given Stem’s outlook, I recommend buying STPK stock at its current levels. Source: Shutterstock As my headline indicates, however, I do think that Stem faces significant risks, including potentially strong competition. A Positive Macro Outlook Using artificial intelligence (AI), Stem says it provides enterprises with “integrated battery storage systems, network integration and battery optimization.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of Additionally, the combination of renewable energy systems and batteries rapidly proliferating, Stem appears to be well-positioned to exploit that trend. Moreover, the company correctly points out that the hugely increased popularity of renewable energy has made managing electricity flow much more 0complex for large businesses, while greatly increasing the difficulty of running grids for utilities. Spurred by increased pressure to become “green,” many more companies and governments will increase their utilization of renewable energy. This is also likely to make batteries and grid management more important is the “electrification of transportation,” which in all probability will make electricity even more important and meaningfully more expensive over the longer term. Importantly, given the latter points, Stem says that it reduces its customers’ “energy costs” by 10%-30%, using its AI. And by “lowering energy costs, stabilizing the grid, alleviating intermittency and reducing carbon emissions, Stem makes itself and STPK stock very appealing. Also, another company which has benefited significantly from these trends is American Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC). The company says that its Grid business, featuring products that help companies and utilities regulate electricity flow and the grid, is delivering consistent growth. American Superconductor refers to these products as “new energy systems.” In Q3, the Grid unit’s sales increased 12% year-over-year. The company noted that the revenue of its “new energy systems” was “driven by… renewable projects in the United States, along with chip factories overseas. “ AMSC stock has surged over 200% in the last 12 months. Stem Has Many Top-Notch Customers Among Stem’s customers are the following very large customers: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), WalMart (NYSE:WMT), UPS (NYSE:UPS), Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), Raytheon (NYSE:RTX), Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP), and InterContinental Hotels (NYSE:ICE). Stem reported that it had helped InterContinental Hotels “halt rising energy costs” in California. Harry Hobbs, an Area Director of Engineering for the company, said that Stem’s “real-time data..is the real differentiator” that allowed him to triple his return on investment, according to Stem. Tough Competition and High Valuation In addition to American Superconductor, Itron (NASDAQ:ITRI) and ESCO Technologies (NYSE:ESE) offer similar solutions to those of Stem. As the sector becomes more lucrative, much larger companies, such as General Electric (NYSE:GE) and NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), could very well enter the sector. At this time, Star Peak Energy is trading at a post-merger valuation, based on certain assumptions, of $5.5 billion. The company’s revenue came in at just $33 million last year, although it says that it expects its sales to jump to $147 million in 2021 and $347 million in 2022. Still, based on the 2022 figure, STPK stock is trading at a pro-forma price-sales ratio of 16, which is quite expensive. Nevertheless, it’s less expensive than many of its SPAC peers, and the company, unlike most other SPAC names, expects its EBITDA to turn positive in 2022. On the other hand, as I pointed out in a recent, previous column, the sentiment towards SPAC stocks has soured somewhat recently, increasing the risk facing Star Point Energy. The Bottom Line on STPK Stock Stem’s huge opportunity and its very impressive customer list outweigh the risk facing the shares at this point. Consequently, I advise growth-oriented, risk-tolerant investors to buy the stock. On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in AMSC and GE.

Morgan Stanley Upgrades Simon Property Group On Potential Earnings Recovery	While the retail REITs segment faces increasing secular challenges, Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE: SPG) has multiple drivers of earnings growth, according to Morgan Stanley. The Simon Property Group Analyst: Richard Hill upgraded Simon Property Group from Equal-Weight to Overweight, while raising the price target to $125. The Simon Property Group Thesis: The company’s earnings seem to have bottomed out in 2020, with a majority of the earnings decline being driven by rent abatements, Hill said in the note. He mentioned four drivers for Simon Property Group’s earnings ahead: Potential recovery of abatements, estimated at a recovery of $410 million. The closing of the TCO acquisition and improved retailer negotiating leverage, estimated to contribute $360 million. Between $55 million and $75 million from retailer investments “$60mn from $800mn of re/development,” the analyst wrote. “We model +6.1% FFO growth in '21e as total NOI growth (including TCO) rebounds to +9.5%. Importantly, we do not assume $410mn of abatements are recovered, which suggest significant potential upside,” Hill added. SPG Price Action: Shares of Simon Property Group had risen by 3.31% to $109.75 on Thursday.

2021-02-09	2021-02-09 15:12:25	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Simon Property Group Stands to Gain From Retail Comeback	Simon Property Group (SPG) delivered disappointing Q4 earnings results after the market closed on February 8. The company reported earnings per share of 2.17, which was six cents below analysts’ estimates of $2.23. Additionally, SPG missed on revenue, delivering $1.13 billion. This reflects a miss of $20 million. One of the bright spots for the company was that it has collected 90% of its net billed rents in the last three quarters of 2020. This was up from 85% in the prior quarter, and has to come as a relief to investors who are looking for confirmation that the retail economy is beginning to come back to life. The miss on both the top and bottom lines is a reminder that the retail recovery is still in its early innings. That fact was acknowledged by CEO David Simon, who said that the company is still attempting to resolve rent issues for some large retailers. One concern hanging over SPG is its debt level. However, Simon confidently put to bed any long-term concerns by noting there was “no chance” the company would have its rating downgraded. There is reason to believe that the sector will post a strong recovery, particularly in the second half of 2021. And Simon said on the earnings call that high quality suburban areas will be where the action is. Although the retail space hasn’t fully bounced back, Simon Property Group is still a buy because the stock has room to run as long as the recovery picks up steam. SPG Stock Has Been a Strong Buy SPG stock surged over 2% prior to the earnings report. However, rather than being a buy the rumor, sell the news event, the stock was still moving higher in after-hours trading. To investors in the stock, this is not a surprise, SPG has a habit of moving higher after earnings no matter how it performed during the quarter. Simon Property Group,perhaps the most well-known real estate investment trust (REIT), had a year it would rather forget in 2020. But since Election Day, SPG stock is behaving as if the retail economy was enjoying a V-shaped recovery that it surely is not. The stock is up 25% over the last three months. Perhaps one reason was SPG’s strategy of buying up bankrupt retailers. It was a bold move that helped keep tenants in its properties. And in its earnings report, it’s an investment that is paying off for the company. A Retail SPAC? Simon Property Group is one of the latest companies to jump on the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) trend. The company announced it was forming an SPAC, and in its registration document sent to the SEC, Simon Property said the goal was “to identify innovative businesses with the potential to disrupt various aspects of the retail, hospitality, entertainment and real estate industries and make a transformative impact on in-person and/or online experiences.” The SPAC will trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol (SPGS.U). Because the company is in the quiet period, there was no more information forthcoming in the earnings report. However, investors should pay close attention to the offering. In identifying a target, one has to imagine it will be looking for a company that would make a good tenant – and potentially help deliver foot traffic back to the company’s portfolio of malls. Wall Street’s Take As 1 Buy, 7 Holds and 1 Sell have been assigned in the past three months, SPG gets a Hold consensus rating. In addition, with the average analyst price target clocking in at $95.43, shares could dip 4% in the year ahead. (See Simon Property stock analysis on TipRanks) SPG Stock Remains a Cautious Buy Simon Property Group has an attractive P/E ratio of 22.49, as of this writing. With that said, SPG stock is still far off its pre-pandemic price of $144.30, with shares currently changing hands for $98.94 apiece. That means if the economy delivers strong growth in the second half, investors will be rewarded. And this name still offers a solid dividend that continues to look safe and has a yield currently sitting at 6.2%.

2021-02-09	2021-02-09 08:45:52	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Simon Property’s 2021 Profit Outlook Beats Estimates; Shares Gain	Real estate company Simon Property Group reported mixed 4Q results, as revenue beat the Street estimates but earnings fell short. Meanwhile, the company’s earnings outlook for fiscal 2021 exceeded analysts’ expectations. Shares rose 2.5% in Monday’s extended market trading session. Simon Property’s (SPG) 4Q earnings of $0.86 per share missed the consensus estimates by a penny and declined 48.2% year-over-year. Revenue declined about 24% year-over-year to $1.13 billion but topped the Street’s estimates of $1.09 billion. The company’s funds from operations (FFO) came in at $2.17 per share, reflecting a negative impact of $0.95 per share due to lower revenues from the company's domestic and international operations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by cost reduction initiatives. Simon Property’s CEO David Simon said, “We feel confident we have turned the corner, and we expect growth in earnings and cash flow in 2021.” For fiscal 2021, the company anticipates earnings in the range of $4.60-$4.85 per share, which is much higher than analysts’ expectations of $3.90 per share. The company projects fiscal 2021 FFO to be in the range of $9.50-$9.75 per share. (See Simon Property stock analysis on TipRanks). Following the results, BMO Capital analyst John Kim maintained a price target of $97 (14.6% upside potential) and a Hold rating on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said, “we believe SPG has high-quality assets (and a creative management) that are well-placed given demographic shifts to suburbia.” Overall, consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 7 Holds, 1 Buy and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $95.43 implies downside potential of about 3.6% to current levels. Shares dropped 24.8% over the past year.

Penney (OTC: JCPN.Q) enters a new phase after a judge approved the retailer's sale to two of its major landlords, Simon Property Group (NYSE: SPG) and Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE: BAM).  Although the department store chain struggled for years before the global pandemic, the COVID-19 outbreak was the coup de grace, forcing J.C. Penney to seek Chapter 11 protection in May. The mall operators, though, risked having yawning canyons of empty anchor stores in their properties if J.C. Penney was liquidated, so they bought the retailer to keep it going.  Now, it and the new owners face a daunting challenge: convincing consumers who once abandoned the retailer it's worth coming back.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/277d7773-8af6-3049-962e-a878ad8a8eff/the-j.c.-penney-sale-is.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-04	2020-12-04 15:00:30	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Covid-19 Lawsuits Are Running Into Skeptical Judges	"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When should the Covid-19 pandemic — or the restrictions imposed in its wake — excuse you from a contract? The courts have been struggling with this issue for months now, and the answer until recently has been ... almost never.That’s in keeping with a long U.S. tradition under which each party to a contract essentially bears the risk of its own promises. But there have been calls for change, and some judges may be listening.Which might cause problems of its own.Let’s start with a bit of history. This fall, like many other law professors who teach contracts, I added to my course a 1918 decision called Hanford v. Public Fair Association, which arose during the 1916 polio pandemic that would eventually kill 6,000 people, mostly children, across the U.S. An entrepreneur who had planned to put on a “baby show” canceled the event and was sued by the property owner who’d expected to make money from the lease. The court ruled for the entrepreneur on the ground that putting on the show would have been dangerous to public health.That was then; this is now.In the explosion of litigation related to Covid-19, cases on breach of contract have gone poorly for parties pleading the pandemic as an excuse. Unlike courts in many other developed countries, the U.S. judicial system tends to enforce contracts as written when the excuse for breach boils down to: ""Things have changed, and the deal is less profitable than I expected.""(1)Consider, for example, the flood of lawsuits challenging clauses in business interruption insurance that exclude losses due to virus. So far, courts have ruled for the insurers against claimants as diverse as mattress stores, medical practices, restaurants, and day spas.(2) The message is that it’s up to the businesses that want insurance against pandemic losses to make sure their contracts provide it. Otherwise, they’re demanding reimbursement for risks they’ve never paid the insurers to assume. This is particularly true given that, as I’ve noted before, insurers have long offered policies specifically designed to deal with pandemics; there just haven’t been many takers.For similar reasons, retailers feuding with their corporate landlords have fared poorly. Courts across the country have held that the pandemic does not excuse commercial tenants from paying rent. Nor is the pandemic a justification for escaping a retail lease entirely. On the day before Thanksgiving, the Court of Appeals of Indiana upheld an injunction preventing Abercrombie & Fitch from permanently closing its locations in malls owned by Simon Property Group. Abercrombie had tried to escape its leases, citing “the current uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19,” but the panel required the stores to stay open as the parties worked through their dispute.Even in notably pro-tenant New York City, the courts have expressed concerns about the pandemic defense. In another Thanksgiving eve decision, Federal District Judge Ronnie Abrams dismissed a lawsuit by landlords who claimed that new rules protecting residential and commercial tenants against “harassment” during the pandemic caused “severe economic harm by impeding their ability to profit from their properties” and therefore violated the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. But the decision was less pro-regulation than it might seem. Judge Abrams agreed that landlords have a right to make money, and cautioned that her decision rested on an interpretation of the rules as in no way interfering with the right of landlords to make “routine demands for rent.” In other words, for Covid-19 rules to survive constitutional scrutiny, they can’t become a sword used to prevent all efforts by landlords to get tenants to pay what they owe.(3)But change may be on the horizon. On November 30, the Delaware Court of Chancery handed down what is believed to be the first major decision allowing a business to back out of a deal because of Covid-19.  South Korea’s Mirae Asset Global Investments Co. was excused from its $5.8 billion agreement to purchase 15 hotels from China’s Dajia Insurance Group on several grounds, among them that the pandemic had led Daija to make significant changes to operations, violating a clause requiring continuation of the “ordinary course of business” until the transaction closed.The decision isn’t necessarily a bellwether, but the outcome suggests that the courts might be starting to pay attention to a growing, thoughtful literature arguing for a more sympathetic approach to pandemic-based claims in contract cases.Whether that would be a problem depends on how one thinks about risk. Consider the 1918 Hanford case with which we began. Although a polio pandemic would certainly justify cancelling a “baby show,” the court still had to decide which party should bear the risk of loss. The dissent argued that the risk should rest on the party who promised to pay, unless that party specifically guarded against the possibility in the contract.This traditional approach often seems unfair, but it possesses the singular virtue of clarity. The parties generally know going into the deal who will have to pay should an unanticipated risk arise. They also know that they should negotiate to cover as many contingencies as possible.Perhaps it’s time to alter those rules. Let’s just be careful not to leave matters so unpredictable that only litigation can sort them out.(1) Many contracts include what are known as ""force majeure"" clauses, which excuse performance for such events as wars and natural disasters (that is, ""acts of God"").But U.S. courts construe these clauses quite narrowly and will not imply an excuse that does not appear in the plain text.(2) Many of those pending in federal courts have been consolidated by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict litigation.(3) In another small victory for landlords, the judge interpreted the rules as applying to tenants “impacted” by the pandemic —not any failure to pay rent.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Stephen L.

2020-11-20	2020-11-20 18:08:22	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Investors Must Decide if Simon’s Tenant Moves Are Daft or Genius	"It’s said that someone who represents himself in court has a fool for a client. What about a landlord who owns their tenants? That’s what we’re going to find out, as Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), the largest operator of shopping malls, continues to buy bankrupt retailers. Over the last few years, the company behind SPG stock bought Aeropostale, Forever 21, Brooks Brothers and Lucky. Along with Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM), it added JCPenney.

The landlord isn’t going to be standing outside the shop. Management will be done by Authentic Brands Group, whose majority owner is Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), according to Wikipedia. Authentic owns dozens of stores, and rights to celebrities like Muhammad Ali and Marilyn Monroe. Authentic even has a slice of Papa John’s (NASDAQ:PZZA) board member Shaquille O’Neal.
Is this genius? Or a fool’s errand? Simon’s stock price has been cut in half this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Simon Says Genius
Simon CEO David Simon insists the move is genius.
At the company’s annual meeting in August, Simon said the merchandise was bought at less than its wholesale value. He said thousands of jobs were saved and the company will recoup its investment within a year.
7 Cyclical Stocks Still Hoping for Another Stimulus Round
If Simon didn’t act, it might not have a business. He said the company collected only half the rent it was owed in May. It was up to three-quarters by summer. But the hit to earnings is substantial.
For the quarter ending Sept. 30, Simon earned $146 million, 48 cents per share, on revenue of $1.06 billion. For the same quarter in 2019 it earned $544 million, $1.77 per share, on revenue of $1.41 billion. For the December quarter, analysts are expecting earnings of $2.34 per share on revenue of $1.15 billion.
While Simon is still making money, other mall owners are going broke. CBL & Associates (OTCMKTS:CBLAQ) and the Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (NYSE:PEI) both filed for bankruptcy at the start of November. CBL owns 100 malls in the Southeast and Midwest. PEI did a pre-packaged bankruptcy that added $150 million in funding.
Authentic Lifeline for SPG Stock or Boat Anchor?
What looks like a lifeline could prove a boat anchor if Authentic can’t make the stores work.
Authentic is partnering with Bolt, a fintech startup, to improve the stores’ e-commerce game with single-click checkout. It’s finding design partners for brands like Juicy Couture. It’s sub-licensing brands like Forever 21 in new markets like Latin America. When it can’t make things work, as with Lucky Brands dungarees, it liquidates the business.
The risks are bigger with JCPenney. Here Authentic only has a “minor” role. Simon and Brookfield are the main players. Penney also anchors many of the partners’ malls. While launching Black Friday sales, and claiming to protect 60,000 jobs, the new owners already raided the pension plan.

The Bottom Line
What Simon is doing will work in the near term.
But the long term comes next year when new inventory must be bought and turned over.
I could find nothing in the latest Authentic Brands moves that bring people into stores. Many of the stores, like Brooks Brothers, are being treated by local media as though they’re going out of business.
Even if mall shopping returns to “normal,” mall revenue is down by nearly half from 2000. There are analysts who insist it was debt that sank many of the tenants and strong brands will reach “the other side.”
But Simon Properties is a real estate investment trust. You don’t buy a REIT as a speculation. You buy it for income. Is the current 6.9% yield on Simon stock sustainable? Simon is no longer for the faint-hearted.

2020-11-16	2020-11-16 18:46:28	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Simon, Taubman Settle Mall Takeover Dispute With Price Cut	(Bloomberg) -- Simon Property Group Inc. has reached a deal to buy rival mall owner Taubman Centers Inc. at a lower price than the companies agreed to in February, avoiding a courtroom battle over the failed deal.The companies agreed to a modified buyout that had Simon pay $43 in cash for each Taubman Centers share, down from the original offer of $52.50 a share for Taubman made just before the coronavirus began sweeping across the U.S.Under the terms of the revised deal, Taubman won’t declare or pay a dividend on its common stock prior to March 1, 2021, and then, only subject to certain limitations and conditions. The companies have also settled their pending litigation, according to a joint statement Sunday.The settlement was announced just hours before a trial over the imploded buyout was slated to start in state court in Michigan. Judge James Alexander in Pontiac, Michigan would decide whether Taubman could force Simon to consummate the acquisition or whether the Indianapolis-based mall operator had proper grounds to pull the plug on the deal.In June, Simon walked away from its initial $3.6 billion offer for Taubman and sought in court to have the transaction terminated. Many analysts speculated the move was a negotiating tactic to get a better price for the deal.Simon argued it had legitimate grounds to scrap the buyout because Taubman’s revenue suffered a “material adverse effect” and the company didn’t take proper steps to mitigate damage from the pandemic. Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Taubman countersued, saying its rival was legally obligated to complete the transaction and that it had taken some of the same steps as Simon to address the fallout from Covid-19.The deal is now expected to close in late 2020 or early 2021.Taubman jumped 8.3% to $42.75 at 1:45 p.m. in New York Monday, and Simon was up 6.1% to $79.25. Through Nov. 13, Taubman shares had fallen 24% since the beginning of March, while Simon’s tumbled 39%.At the end of a pre-trial hearing Friday, Alexander hinted settlement talks between the parties were heating up. “See you Monday unless things happen over the weekend,” the judge told lawyers for both companies.The settlement joins a number of recent accords struck over deals whose value was hammered by the fallout from the Covid-19 outbreak in the U.S. Last month, Tiffany & Co. agreed to drop its suit seeking to force LVMH to fulfill promises to acquire the jeweler after the French handbag maker agreed to a $425 million price cut, valuing the new deal at about $16 billion. LVMH cited concerns about the coronavirus’ effect on Tiffany’s business for trying to cancel the acquisition.Comtech Telecommunications Corp. and Gilat Satellite Networks agreed last month to call off their $532 million merger just before a trial over Comtech’s claims Gilat’s business suffered a “material adverse change” due to the virus. Comtech -- the would be buyer -- agreed to pay Gilat $70 million in a settlement of claims over the failed deal.The Simon case was Simon Property Group Inc. v.

2020-11-16	2020-11-16 18:32:39	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Mall Investors See Reason for Hope With Simon Deal, Vaccine News	(Bloomberg) -- There’s finally some good news for U.S. mall owners, whose shares have taken a beating during the Covid-19 pandemic.Landlords are getting a boost after Simon Property Group Inc. and Taubman Centers Inc. settled their takeover dispute -- a deal that creates a company with a greater focus on high-end properties, which are better able to survive the pandemic and broader shift toward e-commerce. Upbeat news on vaccine developments also sent mall owners’ stocks higher Monday.“Malls aren’t going away -- at least the top ones,” Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst at Piper Sandler & Co., said by phone. “Taubman’s malls, in Simon’s hands, is definitely a winning combo.”Just before a trial was to start this week, Simon, one of the country’s largest mall landlords, reached an agreement to buy Taubman for a lower price than the one the companies agreed to in February. In the new deal, Simon will pay $43 a share in cash for its smaller rival, down from the initial bid of $52.50 made just before the pandemic struck the U.S.Simon shares jumped 7.3% to $80.13 at 1:06 p.m. in New York, Taubman advanced 8.3% to $42.75 and other mall owners also gained, including Brookfield Property Partners LP and Macerich Co. A Bloomberg index of regional mall owners had plunged almost 50% this year through Friday.Debt PainMalls had been struggling before Covid-19, with many shuttering over the past decade as e-commerce gained favor among consumers, but the pandemic accelerated the pain. Tenants who lost revenue have withheld rent, and major chains such as Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney have gone bankrupt.Crushed by mounting debt, landlords Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust and CBL & Associates Properties Inc., which own mostly lower-end malls, have also sought protection from creditors.“The issue with malls has more to do with debt, less so than tenants,” Goldfarb said. “Covid has showed that malls with too much debt will struggle to survive.”In contrast, Simon has a strong balance sheet and access to unsecured debt, which provides it flexibility to reinvest in its properties and charge tenants higher rents, he said. That will help the company navigate the pandemic better than others.Prized AssetsThe deal, set to be completed by early next year, would give Simon control of Taubman’s 21 U.S. malls, including super-upscale centers such as New Jersey’s Mall at Short Hills and the Beverly Center in Los Angeles.“It’s a big deal for Simon because they are going to finally capture prized malls they’ve been looking at for years,” said Lindsay Dutch, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “For high-quality malls, there will be opportunities to fill vacancies, and Simon has the balance sheet and capital to do that. They clearly believe in the future of brick-and-mortar.”The reduced price has benefits for both companies, too, Goldfarb said. Simon would save more than $700 million compared with the original price, and Taubman gets to avoid prolonged, costly litigation, he said.Mall owners now have to contend with Covid-19 cases that are spiking across the U.S., threatening new lockdowns in some areas. But positive news from vaccine trials -- with three companies saying they’ve produced shots that are showing in studies to be more than 90% effective -- is providing some optimism.“Shopping is one of our national hobbies and will continue to be,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management, which holds Simon and Macerich shares. “People need people. That’s what the malls have going for them. It’s a place to go be around people.”Shedding OthersEven as it works to buy Taubman, Simon may abandon 11 malls with high vacancy rates and $1.4 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities debt, according to researchers at Kroll Bond Rating Agency.Four of the malls, with more than $400 million in debt, are already in the process of being repossessed by lenders, according to monthly filings by the loan servicers. The other seven properties are at high risk because of vacant space formerly occupied by department store anchor tenants.“Just because Simon is a strong operator doesn’t mean they’re going to continue with a losing proposition,” Mike Brotschol, a managing director with Kroll’s credit profile unit, said in an interview. “Malls have been struggling for several years. Now that we’re in a pandemic, it’s really going to be the tipping point for many of them that are on the bubble.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mall-investors-see-reason-hope-183239082.html?.tsrc=rss

(NYSE: SPG) and real estate investment trust Taubman Centers, Inc. (NYSE: TCO) have agreed to follow through on their merger deal at a revised price.What Happened: Simon Group will pay $43 per share to acquire an 80% stake in Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership. The original deal terms, proposed in February, were for a purchase consideration of $3.6 billion at $52.50 per share. The Taubman family will continue to hold a 20% controlling interest in the realty partnership company.Another clause in the revised terms prohibits Taubman from declaring dividends until March 1 next year.Why Does It Matter: The initial acquisition deal was drafted before the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Since March, retail businesses were hit hard due to forced lockdowns.Simon Group's stock is trading 48.5% lower on a year-to-date basis and 39% lower from the beginning of March to date. In comparison, Taubman stock has tanked 24% since March.Although the Simon-Taubman deal is more real-estate centric, there have been instances of revised merger terms due to a dip in the retail business. Jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co (NYSE: TIF) agreed to a 2.6% lower acquisition price, from the original $135 per share to a revised $131.50 per share, for its merger deal with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (OTC: LVMUY).Simon Group stands to save $800 million in the deal, based on Sunday's disclosure. The amended acquisition agreement marks the end of a legal dispute in Michigan between the two companies.Price Action: At the end of Friday's trading session, TCO was quoting $39.48, 5.53% higher. Whereas SPG stock gained 8% to close at $74.70.Photo courtesy: Daniel Case via WikimediaSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Nintendo Sells Record 735,000 Switch Consoles In October  * Ford Unveils All-Electric Commercial Transit Van, E-Transit(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-13	2020-11-13 21:54:12	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Mall Giants Simon, Taubman Ready for Trial Over Failed Deal	(Bloomberg) -- Simon Property Group Inc.’s rescinded $3.6 billion offer to buy rival mall owner Taubman Centers Inc. is going to trial Monday after a monthslong dispute sparked by the pandemic.The companies announced a buyout agreement in February, just before Covid-19 hit the U.S., wreaking havoc on retailers and landlords. Simon in June said it was walking away from the deal and sought in court to have it “validly terminated.” Taubman countersued in an effort to force Simon to complete the purchase. Michigan Circuit Court Judge James Alexander will hear the case without a jury and is expected to rule by the end of the year.The timing of the offer couldn’t have been worse. Simon, one of the biggest U.S. mall owners, agreed to pay $52.20 a share for Taubman, a 51% premium. Taubman’s shares have dropped about 30% since March as the virus spread across the country, spurring lockdowns that shuttered bricks-and-mortar stores and pushed shoppers increasingly to the internet.“This situation is black swan times two -- or three,” Simon Property Chief Executive Officer David Simon said about the pandemic on the company’s earnings call this month.There’s a lot at stake for both landlords. Mall owners have been crushed by social-distancing measures, and their cash flow is suffering as rent collections drop and vacancies increase. Even after stores reopened, sales have been slow to recover, and retailer bankruptcies are mounting across the industry.At a hearing Friday, Alexander told lawyers for both companies “see you Monday unless things happen over the weekend,” hinting at the possibility of a settlement.“I wouldn’t be surprised at all to see a settlement over the weekend,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Elliott Stein said in an interview.‘Difficult Road’For shareholders of the smaller Taubman, it’s critical for the deal to go through, even at a reduced price, according to Lindsay Dutch, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “There would be a difficult road ahead if it fails since Taubman has to manage the excess vacancies, all the empty stores coming to malls, and doing so with a much tighter balance sheet than Simon,” she said.Simon, meanwhile, has coveted Taubman’s high-quality centers for years, but “they’re also super-focused on cash flow and want to make sure they’ll get a return on their acquisition,” Dutch added.Read more: Mall shakeout just beginning as complex debt drowns owners Representatives for Simon and Taubman declined to comment.In court filings, Indianapolis-based Simon argued it had legitimate grounds to scrap the buyout because Taubman’s revenue suffered a “material adverse effect” from the coronavirus’s advent and the company didn’t take proper steps to mitigate damage from the pandemic. Simon also cited Taubman’s move to amend $1.63 billion in credit agreements as a violation of the deal.For its part, Taubman noted it took some of the same steps as Simon to address the fallout from Covid-19, and argued its rival was legally obligated to complete the transaction on June 30 as scheduled.The Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based company, led by CEO Robert Taubman, wants the judge to enforce the buyout or award the company damages, including the loss of the premium offered to shareholders. Those damages could exceed $1 billion, according to Elliott Stein, a senior litigation analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst at Piper Sandler & Co., said investors generally believe Taubman has the stronger legal case, but that Simon will fight paying the premium it agreed to and is better equipped financially to drag out the dispute. That could motivate Taubman to settle sooner rather than later because it’s more strapped for cash, he said.Both companies already have run up big tabs: In the third quarter, Taubman recorded $17 million in lawsuit-related expenses, while Simon had roughly $20 million in total legal costs, some of which went toward fighting the deal. “You’re not spending that kind of legal money if you’re just trying to give it the college try,” Goldfarb said.‘Taking a Risk’In a large number of buyouts that imploded over Covid-19 concerns, the parties have found ways to come up with a settlement by cutting the price by about 10%, said Larry Hamermesh, a University of Pennsylvania law professor who specializes in corporate M&A cases.“It’s a sensible resolution that happens frequently,” he said. “It may be difficult to make the case that Covid alone is enough to justify a material adverse change since we haven’t had any rulings to that effect so far. Both sides are taking a risk going to trial.”But both firms have already gone through a monthslong mediation process to no avail.“For a settlement, the two parties need to come to an agreement on a lower price, and that may be difficult to do,” Dutch said. “You have two strong-minded CEOs of two companies, and getting them to come to an agreement to work together could take time.”The case is Simon Property Group Inc. v. Taubman Centers Inc., No. 2020-181675-CB, Michigan Circuit Court, Oakland County (Pontiac).(Updates with judge’s comments in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mall-giants-simon-taubman-face-160000905.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-10	2020-11-10 12:37:05	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Simon Property Misses 3Q Sales Estimates; Shares Slip 4%	Shares of Simon Property Group are down more than 4% in Tuesday's pre-market trading after the real estate company’s 3Q revenue of $1.06 billion missed the Street estimates of $1.08 billion and declined over 25% from the year-ago quarter.Simon Property's (SPG) funds from operations (FFO) of $2.05 per share missed consensus estimates of $2.29 per share and plunged 33% year-over-year, reflecting lower revenues from domestic and international operations. The company said that the pandemic-led impact was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives.Simon Property’s CEO David Simon said that “Despite COVID-19, we are encouraged by the increases we are seeing in shopper traffic, retailer sales and tenant rent collections across our portfolio.” (See SPG stock analysis on TipRanks).Following the results, BMO Capital analyst John Kim maintained a Hold rating and a price target of $68 (about 14% downside potential) on the stock, citing improving trends despite 3Q miss. Kim said “We expect cash flows to improve as abatement and bad debt decline meaningfully from 2Q/3Q levels. Although structural questions on retail will continue, we believe SPG is well placed to thrive long term given its high-quality, diverse portfolio and fortress balance sheet.”Like Kim, the Street is also sidelined on the stock with a Hold analyst consensus. The average price target of $68 implies downside potential of about 14% to current levels. Shares have declined by 46.9% year-to-date.Related News:  Norwegian Cruise Posts Huge 3Q Loss; Shares Rise On Recovery Hopes  Beyond Meat Sinks 22% As 3Q Disappoints; Street Sticks To Hold  Hain Celestial Beats 1Q Estimates On Pandemic-Led Demand More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Beyond Meat, Pizza Hut Join Forces To Launch Plant-Based Meat Pizza   * Repay’s 2020 Sales Outlook Misses The Street; BTIG Sticks To Buy   * Sprout Social's 2020 Outlook Surprises; Stock Up 173% YTD   * Adobe Inks $1.5B Deal To Buy Workfront; Street Bullish	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/simon-property-misses-3q-sales-123705275.html?.tsrc=rss

It's estimated more than 25,000 stores could close this year in the wake of the pandemic, and given the number of retailers, like Macy's (NYSE: M), planning on closures even before the outbreak began, shopping malls could really start struggling to retain tenants in the not-so-distant future.

Penney (OTC: JCPN.Q) says it's continuing to make progress on its planned deal to sell itself to Simon Property Group (NYSE: SPG) and Brookfield Property Group (NASDAQ: BPY), and if the courts approve its sale, the retailer should exit bankruptcy before the holiday season.  J.C. Penney was in deep financial trouble well before the coronavirus pandemic, but the temporary closure of nonessential businesses this spring -- which shuttered all of its brick-and-mortar locations -- pushed the retailer over the edge.  J.C. Penney has a presence in 63 of Simon's shopping malls -- about half of them -- and it's in 99 of Brookfield's. Although the landlords could conceivably have subdivided those large spaces and rented them out to multiple occupants, retailers are finding the pandemic an inopportune time to expand their physical store footprints, so Simon and Brookfield might have been hard-pressed to find new tenants.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a58051f6-6d4f-3ab3-acec-bd52923434c0/j.c.-penney-looks-to-exit.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-15	2020-10-15 20:56:59	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	J.C. Penney Sale Talks Stall Ahead of Crucial Holiday Season	(Bloomberg) -- A plan to sell bankrupt J.C. Penney Co.’s retail operations to its two biggest landlords stalled this week, raising the prospect that creditors will carry the burden of millions of dollars in extra costs as the retailer prepares for the crucial holiday season.Talks between J.C. Penney’s lenders and the would-be buyers, mall owners Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners LP, broke down in recent days, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations. The landlords missed several deal deadlines as communication between the parties lapsed, the people added.The two sides will now turn to mediation to help them determine if they can close the deal, and on what terms, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. They met to begin that process Wednesday, the people said.An attorney for the company has said disputes won’t stand in the way of a final agreement. Representatives for Brookfield, Simon, J.C. Penney and its lender group didn’t comment.Holiday OrdersThe standstill comes ahead of J.C. Penney’s most crucial quarter, since retailers typically make much of their annual revenue in the period between Thanksgiving and the new year.At stake in coming weeks is financial responsibility for tens of millions of dollars of orders, including merchandise the company must have in stock for holiday shopping.Creditors say J.C. Penney’s original sale plan called for the deal to close around October 3, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. A further delay in closing the deal threatens to put the holiday purchasing burden onto the group of creditors running J.C. Penney in its bankruptcy.If the sale closes after orders are made, the landlords would still reap the rewards of the holiday revenue without shouldering the inventory risk.Meanwhile, competitors like Walmart Inc. have moved holiday sales even earlier this year amid concerns about inventory availability and a worsening spread of the new coronavirus that could reduce in-person shopping.Purchase PriceJ.C. Penney said in the filing that the parties were discussing whether the price of the deal must change based on the shifting timeline. Under the original proposal, Simon and Brookfield would pay $800 million for Penney’s operations while lenders would swap $1 billion in debt for 160 stores, six distribution centers and a lease agreement with the landlords.The case has dragged on since the department store chain filed for bankruptcy in May, prompting worry from lenders as the retailer continued to bleed cash. The deal with Simon and Brookfield, announced last month, would preserve 70,000 jobs and keep the chain alive, but has sparked controversy from creditors.Aurelius Capital Management is part of a group that says it’s making its own cash bid for Penney to counter an offer from lenders led by H/2 Capital Partners.(Updates to reference ongoing mediation and lawyer comments in third, fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-c-penney-sale-talks-183604526.html?.tsrc=rss

After reopening theaters in August, Cineworld Group (LSE: CINE) (OTC: CNNW.F) subsidiary Regal Cinemas, the nation's No. 2 chain, said it would temporarily close all 536 of its theaters earlier this month, a reflection of lackluster demand and studio releases repeatedly being delayed until audiences feel comfortable crowding into a movie theater again.

2020-09-14	2020-09-14 08:30:00	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Shopping Is Moving Online. Esports Are Going The Other Way	(Bloomberg) -- It still surprises many people that professional video-game tournaments fill 50,000-seat arenas and that millions of fans watch from their bedrooms, aspiring to compete themselves one day. What hasn’t passed some entrepreneurs by, however, is that this is quietly fueling a big market opportunity.Amateur teams are springing up specializing in esport games such as League of Legends, Counter-Strike and Dota 2, and they want places to meet and compete. Vacancies in city centers created by the shift to online shopping and magnified by the pandemic are perfectly placed to fill the gap, according to several executives.Simplicity Esports has about 40 gaming centers in 15 U.S. states, which let amateurs meet and play together on high-end computers without worrying about cheaters or slow network connections. Its president, Roman Franklin, said that since January he’s seen a 40% to 70% improvement in lease terms for potential new venues. At some locations, he said, the company has secured flexible rents representing 10% of the sites’ gross sales, with no minimum rent and no other costs.“I’m seeing lots of opportunities to continue the expansion of our footprint,” said Franklin.Nasdaq-listed Allied Esports Entertainment Inc. is planning to build additional venues modeled on its flagship esports hub. Built inside The Luxor in Las Vegas, the 30,000-square-foot (9,146-square-meter) HyperX Esports Arena opened in 2018 and is kitted out with gaming PCs and consoles loaded with a variety of esports titles. It also hosts weekly tournaments and events.After starting with arenas in China and mobile gaming centers mounted on 18-wheeler trucks, Allied Esports brought in real estate giants Brookfield and Simon Property Group Inc. as shareholders to further expand its bricks-and-mortar business.“That’s creating access in the right places,” said Allied Esports Chief Executive Officer Jud Hannigan. After pausing work due to the pandemic, he’s waiting for the right moment to resume development of three sites.“The industry is obviously going through a difficult patch here,” said Hannigan. But, he said, “we believe in malls successfully moving to be experience destinations, not just retail destinations.”Amateur Fortnite or League of Legends fanatics inspired by high-profile gamers -- such as Kyle “Bugha” Giersdorf, the 16-year-old who won $3 million in the 2019 Fortnite World Cup final -- want to practice and compete in environments where no one can gain a technical advantage and it’s harder to cheat.“Playing from home is like playing basketball in your driveway -- the hoop may not be 10 feet high and the driveway might be a bit sloped at the front,” said Zack Johnson, CEO of esports services company GGCircuit, which develops and sells cloud-based software used by about 1,000 esports centers around the world.“The camaraderie in person is so much better than playing with a headset,” he said. “It’s important to be able to high-five and fist-bump and hug, and look across a table and see a real human being not just an avatar.”Industry executives say lockdowns impacted and delayed brick-and-mortar expansion plans, but Johnson said more than half of the 20,000 screens that run on its equipment are now back online after lockdowns.Venues were appearing across Europe before the pandemic too, led by a crop of young companies such as France’s Team Vitality and Meltdown, Sweden’s Space, and London-based Game Digital’s Belong network.Kinguin runs a 6,560-square-foot bootcamp-hotel for professional teams in Warsaw. It’s now going after the amateur market and opened an Esports Lounge in the port city of Gdansk in June.CEO Viktor Wanli said the site is operating at half capacity due to social distancing but demand is clear. “We’re having days where gamers have to wait in lines to occupy a station,” he said.Vindex LLC, an esports company established by the founders of Major League Gaming, bought Belong in July and wants to open more than 1,000 venues worldwide.And traditional sports stars are no stranger to the potential: Guild Esports, part-owned by English soccer star David Beckham, last week announced plans for an initial public offering that will help fund a training academy and scouting network.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shopping-moving-online-esports-going-083000940.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-10	2020-09-10 15:16:38	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Mall Operators Should Bet on Amazon, Not J.C. Penney	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- J.C. Penney Co. has a fresh shot at returning itself to retailing relevance. The department store chain said Wednesday evening it had reached an agreement to be rescued from bankruptcy by mall operators Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Group in a deal valued at $1.75 billion. But is this the best outcome?There are upsides to sparing this mall stalwart from liquidation. The acquisition has preserved tens of thousands of jobs and staved off more disruption at U.S. shopping centers, which are reeling from widespread store closures and pandemic-related shopper caution. Still, the deal could turn out to be short-sighted for the mall operators, a squandered moment to reimagine their spaces for the future instead of just trying to survive.It is understandable that Simon and Brookfield wouldn’t want to see J.C. Penney go out of business right now. Even though anchor tenants such as J.C. Penney don’t typically pay top-dollar rents, no one wants that much vacant square footage in their malls. Empty store fronts don’t exactly make the place look exciting and inviting. And shopping centers are an ecosystem, with each store helping draw traffic to the others.There would be clearer logic to saving the chain, though, if it hadn’t been so troubled before the pandemic. J.C. Penney had frequently recorded annual losses in recent years, including under Ron Johnson’s brief but disastrous tenure as CEO, when it alienated customers by pivoting away from its familiar promotion and discounting strategy. Later, another CEO, Marvin Ellison, tried to position J.C. Penney as a destination for appliances in a bid to steal business away from struggling Sears, an approach that didn’t meaningfully reinvigorate the chain – and was quickly abandoned by his successor. More recently, CEO Jill Soltau has been working to revamp the in-store shopping experience with nicer dressing rooms and less clutter.  And then came the pandemic, which has left many consumers avoiding in-store shopping and reduced their need for work clothes and dressy attire. So, in rescuing J.C. Penney, the mall operators have preserved some semblance of near-term stability and normalcy at their centers. Unfortunately, that allows them to kick the can down the road on a harder, but ultimately more important, task: dramatically transforming their brick-and-mortar outposts into places that can thrive long after the pandemic has receded. Having to hunt for a tenant for those cavernous J.C. Penney stores right now would be extremely difficult, but it would also force more creativity. For example, the Wall Street Journal reported last month that Simon was in talks with Amazon.com Inc. about the online shopping behemoth setting up fulfillment centers in spaces once occupied by Sears or J.C. Penney, an unconventional set-up that is absolutely worth trying. Maybe letting J.C. Penney fail would encourage more such innovative approaches.In general, it’s good that Simon and Brookfield are committed to helping key business partners weather the once-in-a-generation storm that is roiling the retail world. But, in the rear-view mirror, this particular salvage attempt may end up looking like a missed opportunity. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-09-10	2020-09-10 00:15:52	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	J.C. Penney Lenders, Landlords Ink Deal to Keep Chain Open	(Bloomberg) -- J.C. Penney Co.’s lenders have agreed to team up with mall landlords Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners to buy the bankrupt chain of department stores.The $1.75 billion rescue deal, which would preserve about 70,000 jobs, includes a $300 million equity investment by the landlords, Joshua Sussberg of Kirkland & Ellis said on behalf of J.C. Penney in a Wednesday bankruptcy hearing. It also calls for new financing from existing lenders and would ultimately leave the retailer with about $1 billion, subject to certain transaction costs and a working capital adjustment, Sussberg said.The financing includes a commitment for $2 billion of new asset-based lending led by Wells Fargo, as well as $500 million of so-called takeback debt from existing first-lien lenders, he said. The deal would split J.C. Penney into an operating company and two real estate holding companies, one owning 161 stores and the other holding distribution centers, with a master lease agreement between the two sides.“The transaction between the lenders, the company, and Simon and Brookfield contemplates a $1.75 billion total enterprise, plus a post-closing earn-out and a significantly negotiated working capital adjustment,” Sussberg said in the hearing. The deal could still fall through and it requires court approval, which the retailer intends to seek in early October.“Time, as we’ve mentioned over and over again, is not our friend,” Sussberg said. “It is important -- for this transaction to stay together and for all these stores to stay open and for the 70-plus-thousand employees to stay employed -- for us to move with lightning speed.”Best PathChief Executive Officer Jill Soltau called the agreement “the best path forward” for stakeholders. “The interest in our operations reflects our company’s strength and our loyal customer base.”The lender group was already set to take over most of J.C. Penney’s real estate at the outset of the bankruptcy case, with a plan that would have involved spinning the properties into a real estate investment trust and selling the rest of the retailer to the highest bidder. The attempts to reach a sale agreement with outside bidders hit roadblocks as the case dragged on.“A joint purchase of bankrupt J.C. Penney would help Simon Property preserve occupancy at large anchor boxes that may be difficult to fill amid a pandemic-driven climb in vacancy,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lindsay Dutch wrote in a research note.The case is J.C. Penney Company Inc., 20-20182, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Corpus Christi).(Updates with comment on plan in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-c-penney-lenders-landlords-193011012.html?.tsrc=rss

Simon Property-Led Group To Buy Bankrupt Brooks Brothers For $325M	Bankrupt apparel retailer Brooks Brothers announced that it is set to be bought up by Authentic Brands and Simon Property-led Sparc Group after the bidders increased their purchase offer to $325 million.Brooks Brothers said that Authentic Brands and the Simon Property-led group (SPG) were selected as the winning bidders in the sale process after they ramped up their offer to $325 million from a previous $305 million. As part of the offer, the bidders will purchase the vast majority of Brooks Brothers’ global business operations as a going concern, as well as its intellectual property portfolio. They will also commit to continue to operate at least 125 of its retail stores and intend to preserve the iconic Brooks Brothers brand.The clothing retailer, which has 200 stores in North America and 500 worldwide, filed for bankruptcy proceedings on July 8.  Sparc, an operator of lifestyle brands including Aéropostale and Nautica, is owned by Authentic Brands Group and Simon Property Group.The proposed transaction is subject to court approval and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval. The hearing to approve the sale is currently scheduled for August 14. Provided closing conditions are met, the transaction is expected to be completed by the end of this month.Simon Property shares have been hit hard losing 55% of their value so far this year. Looking ahead, the $88.14 average analyst price target implies more than 31% upside potential over the coming year.Last month, BMO Capital analyst Jeremy Metz downgraded Simon Property to Hold from Buy.“We see SPG as a winner, and consolidator, in the long term given its high-quality portfolio, management team, track record, and A-rated balance sheet,” Metz wrote in a note to investors. “However, despite the attractive valuation and +5% dividend yield, with lingering closing pressures subduing earnings growth, we think upside could be limited in the near term until headline pressures ease and a path to better growth emerges.”Overall, Wall Street analysts have a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy consensus shows 4 Buys versus 5 Holds.

Why Amazon-Simon Property Deal Would Bring Malls 'Closer To Relevancy'	Reports of Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN) interest in taking over empty store space in Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE: SPG) malls are &quot;absolutely true,&quot; Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist at Center Square Investment Management, said on CNBC.What Happened: Simon Properties, the largest mall owner, likely resisted the idea of allocating space to Amazon, Crowe said. But now Simon needs to change its attitude as recognize it needs to start &quot;swimming with the tide&quot; and accept the clear trends in retail.Specifically, one-third of all goods travel through a distribution warehouse versus a physical retail storefront and this number will merely increase to as much as 50%, he said.Why It's Important: Simon and Amazon can work together is part of a win-win relationship. Amazon could buy empty space in Simon's malls that were left vacant and inject new revenue for Simon.At the same time, Simon offers Amazon access to being closer to the end consumer as most major malls aren't far removed from major population centers.What's Next: Malls are becoming more obsolete as time passes and the inclusion of an Amazon warehouse or pickup center could inject some life back into malls, Crowe.&quot;Malls are becoming irrelevant; this brings them closer to relevancy,&quot; Crowe said.Related Links:PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Simon Property GroupM&A Activity Falls To Decade Low During PandemicSee more from Benzinga  * 3 Takes On Russia's Speedy Coronavirus Vaccine Development  * Meet Triller, The TikTok Rival That Is Top Ranked In 80 Countries  * Should Investors Continue Riding With Uber?

2020-08-11	2020-08-11 03:05:30	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Brooks Brothers Bidding Narrows to Venture Backed by New Barneys Owner	(Bloomberg) -- Bankrupt Brooks Brothers Group Inc. is on the verge of being sold to a partnership that includes the new owner of Barneys New York and one of the biggest U.S. mall operators.Sparc Group LLC, which is backed by Authentic Brands Group LLC and Simon Property Group Inc., is expected to be the winning bidder after rivals including WHP Global dropped away, according to people familiar with the sale process. An official update could come as early as Tuesday, said the people, who weren’t authorized to speak publicly before the announcement.Authentic and Simon had previously disclosed they were bidding $305 million in a court-supervised auction for Brooks Brothers’ global business operations. The sale would save at least 125 of the men’s clothing stores, while enabling Authentic to increase its collection of well-known retail brands and Simon to keep one of its mall tenants in business.Representatives for Brooks Brothers, Authentic and WHP Global, which owns the Joseph Abboud and Anne Klein brands, declined to comment. Simon didn’t immediately respond to messages left after regular business hours.Brand RevivalAuthentic specializes in reviving beaten-down brands, including Aéropostale and Nautica. Sparc runs more than 2,600 retail stores, shop-in-shops and an e-commerce platform.WHP, with backing from funds run by Oaktree Capital and BlackRock Inc., was originally named the lender on Brooks Brothers’ bankruptcy loan, which typically puts a lender in a strong position to become the new owner.But Authentic and Simon submitted a competing offer that Brooks Brothers annointed as the preferred “stalking horse” bid for a bankruptcy auction. The status came with a $9.1 million break-up fee and up to $1 million in expenses if they were outbid, according to court papers.WHP complained at an Aug. 3 hearing that Brooks Brothers ran roughshod over its bid, even though it was higher at $334 million in cash, according to WHP’s lawyer, Gary Kaplan of Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson.Bid Revoked“For whatever reason, that’s been stalled, delayed, slow-walked,” Kaplan said. With Brooks Brothers downplaying the value of WHP’s bid, and with $10 million of breakup expenses to shoulder, WHP and the public company with which it was collaborating planned to revoke their bid if Authentic and Simon were approved as the stalking horse, he said.Bloomberg reported earlier that Authentic and Simon were positioning themselves to own the 200-year-old chain. The duo has teamed up before, with a pending offer for Lucky Brand Dungarees, and they’ve held talks along with Brookfield Property Partners LP about buying bankrupt J.C. Penney Co. and Ann Taylor’s parent, Ascena Retail Group Inc. Authentic and the two mall operators already bought Forever 21 Inc., which went bankrupt last year.Brooks Brothers said on July 8 when it filed for bankruptcy that it plans to permanently shut 51 stores in the U.S. It counted 500 worldwide in 45 countries, with 200 in North America. A hearing to approve the sale of the retailer’s assets was scheduled for later this week.The case is Brooks Brothers Group Inc., 20-11785, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.To view the docket on Bloomberg Law, click here.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brooks-brothers-bidding-narrows-venture-030530329.html?.tsrc=rss

During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.For those who don't have the time to tune in live or listen to the podcast, Benzinga will highlight one stock that merits further discussion. This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation.The COVID-19 crisis has had a devastating effect on the retail industry, and especially on companies that rely on foot traffic. This would be most applicable to malls -- gigantic structures that are expensive to operate and maintain.The PreMarket Prep Stock of the Day, Simon Property Group (NYSE: SPG), is attempting to replace the big box stores that are leaving. About Simon Property Group: Simon Property Group is an American commercial real estate company, the largest retail real estate investment trust and the largest shopping mall operator in the U.S. Its portfolio includes more than 325 properties that operate under five real estate platforms.Simon On The Decline Before COVID-19: One of the first victims of the Amazon-ing of the world was large malls and subsequently their operators. When purchases could be made so easily online, the need for going to a mall or similar retail centers was no longer a necessity.Along these lines, huge tenants such as Macy's (NYSE: M) and J C Penney Company Inc (Pink: JCPNQ) began to close stores as the business model came under siege, leaving large and unusable spaces in their wake.Major Consolidation Period: As the coronavirus gripped the world, stay-at-home-polices were instituted and the markets began to crumble, Simon went along for the ride.While the S&P 500 index fell 35% from peak to trough, Simon Property fell from its Feb. 21 high of $142.77 to $42.25 on April 2, or a decline of 70%. The issue did manage to more than double in price from that depressed level when it peaked on June 9 at $90.32. Interestingly, that high came one day before it was announced that the company had terminated its deal to purchase Taubman Centers (NYSE: TCO).Simon Property was unable to sustain the rally and did not find major buyers until it reached the $60 area, with multiple lows just above and below that area in late July and early August.Until Monday, the issue was in a trading range between $59.03 and $67 beginning in early July, with a majority of the price acton taking place in the $62-$64.50 area.If You Can't Beat Them, Join Them: Over the weekend, it was reported that Simon Property was looking at turning empty Sears and JCPenney stores into Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) fulfillment centers.Investors seeking any type of good news on the issue are aggressively purchasing shares of the issue in Monday's session ahead of its second-quarter report after the close.Simon's Premarket Price Action: The author of this article noticed the recent trading range and said on Monday's PreMarket Prep that if the issue could hold $65, the next daily resistance levels are at the pair of highs just under $67 from July 8 ($66.80) and July 15 ($66.72).In a seesaw session, Simon Property dipped to $63.82 and then rallied to the $67 level. The stock was trading 8.53% higher to $67.40 at last check. Simon Property Moving Forward: It's anyone's guess what Simon's second-quarter report will look like and how the Street will react. From a fundamental standpoint, it is encouraging the company is making efforts to fill large mall vacancies. Yet the potential rent per square foot that Amazon will be demanding could be quite a bit lower than Simon's previous tenants.The full discussion on the issue from today's show can be found here:Photo by Dough4872 via Wikimedia.

2020-08-10	2020-08-10 16:20:25	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Amazon Finally Finds a Good Fit at the Mall	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Amazon.com Inc. might soon be filling online orders from the kinds of shopping centers it has helped destroy.The e-commerce giant, according to the Wall Street Journal, is in talks with mall operator Simon Property Group Inc. about setting up fulfillment centers in spaces currently or formerly occupied by J.C. Penney and Sears, two once-mighty department stores that have filed for bankruptcy protection.Although initially it might seem like an unnatural fit for a warehouse to be plugged into a space that was designed for shopping, such an arrangement has the potential to accomplish important goals for Amazon and Simon.The promise of one-day or even same-day delivery is a core reason to shell out for Amazon’s Prime membership, so it benefits the company to have warehouse facilities close to population centers. Cavernous J.C. Penney and Sears stores certainly fit that bill. Potentially even more important, though, is what’s outside the department stores: giant, convenient parking lots. This setup gives Amazon the option of offering customers curbside pickup of online orders and even returns.Curbside was already gaining traction before the pandemic, but customer interest appears to have exploded in recent months as shoppers practice social distancing. Target Corp., for example, said 2 million people tried its drive-up service for the first time in the first quarter. Amazon needs more ways to compete in this model as more consumers embrace it. Whenever the coronavirus recedes, I expect pickup to remain popular, especially in suburbs where people often rely on cars instead of public transit. These are not orders that Amazon should cede competing for, because pickup orders are often more profitable than home delivery ones: There are no last-mile delivery costs.Simon, meanwhile, could consider other options for filling the holes left (or soon-to-be left) by J.C. Penney and Sears. In recent years, mall operators have often sought to enliven their centers by attracting tenants such as gyms and restaurants, which had the ability to drive foot traffic. The harsh reality of the pandemic, though, is that those businesses now carry health concerns and are not going be the reliable draw that they were even a year ago.Plus, many department stores pay trifling rents based on their historic role as anchor tenants, meaning they brought traffic to the whole mall. Given the struggles at J.C. Penney and Sears in recent years, I doubt they are doing much these days to bring visitors to Simon properties. A warehouse wouldn’t be a shopper magnet, either, but at least Simon could probably arrange to get more favorable rents than it does from a department store.In the past, Amazon has made head-scratching forays into traditional malls, such as with its now-shuttered kiosks, which showcased Kindles and other gadgets. Over the years, there has been ample chatter about Amazon potentially finding a new life for old-school retail real estate. Remember the reports that Amazon was looking to buy some RadioShack stores? It’s a good thing that never came together, because it wouldn’t have worked out well for Amazon to be saddled with a bunch of outposts in failing malls that were too tiny to use as fulfillment centers. Analysts have also discussed the idea that Amazon could use former Sears or Kmart stores for its Whole Foods Market chain, something that never made much sense to me given the differing demographic profiles of the customers of those retailers.Using old department stores as fulfillment centers, though, would finally be an Amazon.com incursion to the mall that actually makes sense.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

The pain from a slew of major retail bankruptcies, including Neiman Marcus and Brooks Brothers, and hundreds of store closures from department stores Macy's and Nordstrom and others is far from over for shopping malls, as the coronavirus pandemic takes a toll on brick-and-mortar retailers that were already losing sales to online competitors.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-u-mall-operator-simon-051858877.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-09	2020-08-09 21:21:11	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Amazon Could Use JCPenney, Sears Stores As Fulfillment Centers: Report	What Happened: Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) is in talks with Simon Property Group Inc. (NYSE: SPG), the biggest mall owners in America, to convert some of its anchor-department store spaces into Amazon fulfilment centers, The Wall Street Journal said on Sunday.The discussions are on between Amazon and Simon property group to utilize some closed J.C. Penny and Sears stores for Amazon fulfilment centers. There is no confirmation on the exact number of stores that are currently being considered.Why It's Important: More fulfillment centers near residential areas would mean a speedy &quot;last mile&quot; of delivery for Amazon, The Wall Street Journal said. Amazon is truly focused on its &quot;last mile&quot; of delivery. Not only they recruited new drivers to deliver goods, but they also toyed with the idea of using drones to deliver the packages.The discussions between Simon group with the online retail giant started even before the COVID-19 pandemic took place. The two organizations explored the idea of converting stores formerly occupied by J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp. into Amazon distribution centers.According to The Wall Street Journal, the talks reflect the intersection of two trends that predate the pandemic but have been accelerated by it: the decline of malls and the boom in e-commerce.What Next: Simon and Brookfield Property Partners LP have put in a joint bid for J.C. Penney, which filed for bankruptcy in May, the report said. The take-over would give them control over the store space. It would be interesting to see whether Amazon could reach an agreement with Simon to utilize the anchor stores in order to expedite its delivery process and ensure customer satisfaction.See more from Benzinga  * Twitter Reportedly In Preliminary Talks For Possible Acquisition of TikTok  * Biden Accidentally Reveals GM's Future Corvette Plans  * Berkshire Hathaway's Profit Up By 87% Amid Business Slowdown(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-09	2020-08-09 18:50:06	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Simon Property Weighs Empty Mall Spaces as Amazon Centers: DJ	(Bloomberg) -- Mall operator Simon Property Group Inc. has been in talks with Amazon.com Inc. to turn some empty store space formerly occupied by anchor tenants such as J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp. into Amazon fulfillment centers, Dow Jones reported, citing people familiar with the matter.The discussions started before the coronavirus pandemic, with the two companies exploring the idea of buying out occupied space from the retailers in some cases.Amazon has also been in talks with multiple mall landlords about putting its coming grocery-store chain in J.C. Penney locations, a person familiar with the matter told Dow Jones, though it couldn’t be determined if that included Simon malls.It wasn’t clear how many stores are under consideration for Amazon, and it is possible that the two sides could fail to reach an agreement, the newswire said.Shares of Simon have fallen 58% so far this year. It’s partnering with Brookfield Property Partners LP to jointly bid for J.C. Penney, which filed for bankruptcy in May.Turning over anchor store spaces in prime locations to Amazon would represent a major shift in the mall business. If Simon rents the space as fulfillment centers, it would probably accept a considerable discount to what it could charge another retailer, Dow Jones said. The choice also won’t please nearby tenants: fulfillment centers draw less foot traffic to the mall, and it would help make Amazon, seen as a disruptor of retail businesses, even more competitive.Even before the pandemic, Amazon has already bought the sites of some failed malls and re-purposed them to distribution centers. The e-commerce giant continues to open up new fulfillment centers to meet the demand for delivery, and its virus protection for warehouse workers has come under scrutiny.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/simon-property-weighs-empty-mall-185006419.html?.tsrc=rss

Penney Co Inc hangs on whether the department store chain can reach a complex deal within days to sell itself to an alliance of retail mavens and distressed-debt investors.

2020-07-27	2020-07-27 17:09:15	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Simon Property-Led Group Offers To Buy Brooks Brothers For $305M	The Sparc Group, owned by Authentic Brands Group LLC and Simon Property Group (SPG), has offered to buy bankrupt Brooks Brothers for $305 million.According to the deal, Sparc Group would purchase substantially all of Brooks Brothers’ global business operations as a going concern. In addition, the group would also commit to acquire at least 125 Brooks Brothers retail stores. The offer is part of a so-called “stalking horse” agreement, which means the sale price marks the start of a bidding process for other parties to beat in a bankruptcy auction for America’s oldest apparel chain.Brooks Brothers filed a motion in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware to obtain court approval for the asset purchase agreement with Sparc. The clothing retailer, which has 200 stores in North America and 500 worldwide, filed for bankruptcy proceedings on July 8.A court hearing for the approval of Sparc’s bid has been set for Aug. 3 with the deadline for the receipt of any other bidders set for Aug. 5. The final hearing to approve the final sale is scheduled for Aug. 11.Earlier this month, Sparc entered into a stalking horse asset agreement to snap up bankrupt clothing retailer Lucky Brand Dungarees. Simon Property shares rose about 1% to $60.92 in Monday’s pre-market trading. The stock has been hit hard losing 59% of its value so far this year.Overall, analysts have a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy consensus shows 4 Buys versus 5 Holds and 1 Sell. Looking ahead, the $83 average analyst price target implies 37% upside potential over the coming year. (See SPG stock analysis on TipRanks)Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs analyst Caitlin Burrows this month resumed coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and $94 price target (55% upside potential) on expectations that the company's same-site operating income growth will improve in 2021 as properties are fully operational and return to a more normalized rate in 2022.Related News:  Bankrupt Hertz Strikes $650M Deal To Settle Fleet Reduction Plan  Tesla Gains 4% After-Hours On Upbeat Q2 Earnings  Kimberly-Clark Rises On 2Q Earnings Beat and Upbeat Guidance	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/simon-property-led-group-offers-170915927.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-24	2020-07-24 17:41:42	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Bankrupt Brooks Brothers Gets Rescue Takeover Bid	(Bloomberg) -- The race to purchase Brooks Brothers Group Inc. out of bankruptcy is on as brand manager WHP Global and a group of Italian companies prepare bids following Authentic Brands Group LLC and Simon Property Group Inc.’s $305 million offer.Sparc Group LLC, which is backed by Barneys New York owner Authentic and mall landlord Simon, agreed to make a $305 million bid in a court-supervised auction for Brooks Brothers’ global business operations, according to a statement.The group has committed to take on at least 125 of the clothing stores in its so-called stalking-horse bid, which sets a minimum price for the auction. A higher bid could still emerge before an Aug. 5 deadline as other firms prepare competing offers.WHP Global, which owns the Joseph Abboud and Anne Klein brands, is preparing a bid for the retailer’s assets, the firm confirmed in a statement to Bloomberg. “It’s early innings in the Brooks Brothers bankruptcy sale process,” and “we are big believers in the power of the Brooks Brothers brand, the global footprint and the management team,” said Yehuda Shmidman, chief executive officer of WHP.Backed by funds managed by Oaktree Capital and BlackRock Inc., WHP was originally named the lender on Brooks Brothers’ bankruptcy loan before Authentic and Simon submitted a competing offer that ultimately won out.Italian BidA group of Italian companies, including Giglio Group SpA, is also working on an offer, according to spokesman for Giglio in Milan.Brooks Brothers’ agreement with Sparc comes with a $9.1 million break-up fee and up to $1 million in expenses if the stalking horse doesn’t win the auction, according to court papers. A hearing on the sale will be held Aug. 11.Brooks Brothers said on July 8 when it filed for bankruptcy that it plans to permanently shut 51 stores in the U.S. It has 500 worldwide in 45 countries, with 200 in North America.Authentic specializes in reviving beaten-down brands, including Aéropostale and Nautica. Sparc runs more than 2,600 retail stores, shop-in-shops and an e-commerce platform, the company said.More Suitors Bloomberg reported earlier that Authentic and Simon were positioning themselves to own the 200-year-old chain. The duo has teamed up before, with a pending offer for Lucky Brand Dungarees, and they’ve held talks along with Brookfield Property Partners LP about buying bankrupt J.C. Penney Co. and Ann Taylor’s parent, Ascena Retail Group Inc. Authentic and the two mall operators already bought Forever 21 Inc., which went bankrupt in September.Read more: Brooks Brothers goes bust with business clothes losing favorBrooks Brothers asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi in Wilmington, Delaware, to approve rules for the bidding process and auction. Brooks Brothers is trying to attract as many suitors as possible to compete with the current stalking horse, or lead, bidder, the company said in a court filing Thursday.“The goal of the Debtors’ continued postpetition sale process is now to leverage the Stalking Horse Agreement to have new or existing bidders submit offers for the Company’s assets,” Derek Pitts, managing director at PJ Solomon, said in the filing on behalf of Brooks.In May four suitors sent Brooks official indications of interest, Pitts said.The case is Brooks Brothers Group Inc., 20-11785, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.To view the docket on Bloomberg Law, click here.(Updates with Italian bidders in first, sixth paragraphs.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bankrupt-brooks-brothers-gets-rescue-020327694.html?.tsrc=rss

Authentic Brands, Sycamore Partners Weigh Bids for Ann Taylor Parent	(Bloomberg) -- Authentic Brands Group and Sycamore Partners are among the parties considering buying bankrupt Ann Taylor parent Ascena Retail Group Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.Authentic would team up with the two largest mall landlords, Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners, to buy all or some of Ascena’s assets, said the people, who declined to be identified because the process isn’t public.Ascena had been struggling to contend with dated brands and merchandise and a shift to online shopping despite a string of acquisitions over the years. In its bankruptcy filing, it said it plans to winnow its 2,800 locations to just 1,200, putting a significant portion of its 40,000 employees at risk.The company’s other chains include Loft, Lane Bryant and Justice. It said in court papers that it plans to close all of the stores in its Catherines chain. Australia’s City Chic Collective Ltd. agreed to be the lead bidder in an expected auction for Catherines’ intellectual property and e-commerce business.Representatives for Authentic, Ascena, Sycamore and Brookfield declined to comment, while Simon didn’t respond to a request for comment.Read more: Ann Taylor parent goes bankrupt, plans to shut over 1,000 storesAscena entered into an agreement with its lenders to cut debt in exchange for reorganized equity. The restructuring will give control to firms who support the plans, according to court records. Those include Bain Capital and Monarch Alternative Capital, which each get to appoint a director to the company’s board. A consortium of lenders including those firms, Eaton Vance Corp. and Lion Point Capital will choose another.Though the current agreement calls for lenders to own Ascena after the bankruptcy, plans could change based on competing future bids for the company as a whole, or some of its brands, said the people. The situation remains fluid and requires court approval, as well as the consent of the parties who are subject to the restructuring agreement, they added.Authentic and Sycamore have emerged as major players amid a retail shakeout that’s seen waves of bankruptcies and liquidations. Both are also considering purchasing bankrupt department store J.C. Penney Co. Most recently, Authentic partnered with Simon and Brookfield to buy bankrupt Forever 21, a fast-fashion clothing chain with hundreds of mall stores.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/authentic-brands-sycamore-partners-weigh-202639764.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-23	2020-07-23 12:32:57	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Ann Taylor Parent's Bankruptcy Is the Scariest Yet	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In the latest example of how the world of brick-and-mortar retail is being overwhelmed by the pandemic, specialty apparel conglomerate Ascena Retail Group Inc. — corporate parent of Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant and other chains —  filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company said Thursday its restructuring plan will allow it to reduce its debt by $1 billion. It also will close an unspecified number of stores across all of its major banners, including shuttering all of its Catherines plus-size apparel locations.Ascena may not have the cultural primacy of some of the other prominent names in the industry that have recently filed for bankruptcy. It doesn’t have the long, storied heritage of Brooks Brothers, the preppy clothier that opened its first shop more than 200 years ago. It didn’t define a fashion moment like J. Crew did a decade ago when Michelle Obama was sporting its embellished cardigans. It’s not a household name like J.C. Penney.But make no mistake: Ascena’s bankruptcy is the scariest yet for the industry in the Covid-19 era, because the company’s collapse has the potential to create more devastating ripple effects than were caused by almost any of the other retail washouts that preceded it.Ascena had nearly 2,800 stores as of February, a staggeringly large portfolio that includes Loft and kids’ shop Justice. That makes it a highly important tenant for many mall operators. The company accounted for 4.7% of annualized base rent at Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc., according to that operator’s latest quarterly filing, a share that makes Ascena its second-largest tenant behind only Gap Inc. For Simon Property Group Inc., only Gap and Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands Inc. account for a greater share of annual base rent than Ascena. It is in the top 10 for Brookfield Property Partners and Acadia Realty Trust.Ascena has not detailed exactly how many stores it will close. It committed to closing all of its Catherines outposts, which numbered almost 300 as of February. It said it will shutter a “significant” portion of its more than 800 Justice stores, and a “select” number of its Ann Taylor, Loft, Lane Bryant and Lou & Grey locations. Whatever the final number is, because Ascena is so omnipresent, it could leave landlords with loads of vacancies that will be difficult to fill with so few retailers in expansion mode right now. The sheer size of its store fleet means it has the potential to do more harm than could be inflicted by J. Crew, which only has about 490 stores total and hasn’t committed to a major store closure program, or Brooks Brothers, which said it is to close about one-fifth of its 250 locations. J.C. Penney is almost as ubiquitous as Ascena, with more than 840 stores at the end of its latest fiscal year. But so far, the department-store chain has only moved to close less than a third of them. And, importantly, J.C. Penney stores are essentially all located in enclosed malls, limiting the extent to which its struggles can weigh on other parts of the retail world. Ascena, however, is virtually everywhere. Ann Taylor and Justice stores are fixtures in traditional malls; Lane Bryant and Catherines chains are often in strip-shopping centers. Loft stores are found in mixed-use developments, while factory outposts of the Ann Taylor and Loft brands are mainstays in outlet malls. That means a wider variety of chains count it as a co-tenant and could feel pain from being next to an empty storefront. It is far from surprising that Ascena has ended up in bankruptcy. I wrote a column more than two years ago putting the company on retail death watch because its problems were so wide-ranging and far gone. It has been saddled with a heavy debt load ever since its 2015 deal to buy Ann Inc., the name of the company that then included Ann Taylor and Loft. It has routinely struggled to deliver comparable sales growth amid strategic misfires ranging from making clothes its customers didn’t want to promotional pricing that chipped away its profit margin. I have long wondered why its Lane Bryant and Catherines chains haven’t scored more customers, considering that the plus-size apparel market is woefully underserved. Covid lockdowns haven’t helped, it’s true — masses of professional women working from home in their casual clothes during the pandemic has certainly made for a tough turn for Ann Taylor. But the chain was hurting long before this crisis, part of a bewildering collective failure of the retail industry to make attire women want to wear at the office. The Ascena bankruptcy isn’t even the first one this month that resulted, in part, from that ineptitude: RTW Retailwinds Inc., the corporate parent of the New York & Co. chain, also filed for bankruptcy protection in July and said it plans to close “a significant portion, if not all” of its stores. There will be plenty more retail bankruptcies and store closures in the coming months that will be at least partly attributable to the pandemic’s impact on shopping. Clothing chains, I expect, will comprise an outsize portion of them.Customers may have returned to stores at a faster clip than some retailers anticipated, but traffic generally remains at levels the industry was not built to sustain.Meanwhile, the U.S. is seeing an uptick in Covid-19 cases, which could dissuade some shoppers from stepping foot into a store again anytime soon. The June unemployment rate was 11.1%, and at least for now, no additional stimulus checks are headed to consumers’ bank accounts. That leaves clothing retailers in an especially difficult position – and it almost certainly means more of them will be joining Ascena in bankruptcy.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-07-11	2020-07-11 00:43:22	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Brooks Brothers Gets Bankruptcy Loan With Zero Interest Rate	(Bloomberg) -- Competition to buy retailer Brooks Brothers Group Inc. will allow the company to fund its reorganization in bankruptcy with an $80 million loan that carries a zero interest rate and no closing fees.ABG-BB LLC, a partnership between Authentic Brands Group LLC and mall landlord Simon Property Group Inc., will provide the loan. The generous terms reflect competition between that group and WHP Global, a brand-buying company backed by distressed debt giant Oaktree Capital Management LP, Garrett Fail, the retailer’s lawyer, said during a court hearing Friday.“I’m convinced the terms will be the best that can be achieved,” Fail told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi during the company’s first court hearing, which was held by telephone.Sontchi said he would sign an order allowing the company to initially borrow $60 million. The company will return to court in the coming weeks to get permission to draw the rest of the money, which will be used to fund operations case while Brooks Brothers tries to find a buyer.Before filing for bankruptcy, Brooks Brothers had arranged a $75 million DIP loan from WHP Global, owner of the Joseph Abboud and Anne Klein brands. The new loan will provide $80 million, eliminate an early repayment penalty and give the company more time to close any sale arranged as part of the bankruptcy case, Fail said.Lenders who make so-called debtor-in-possession loans often have an advantage when trying to buy a company out of bankruptcy. Such loans almost always carry a higher interest rate than a non-bankrupt company would be charged.“This is a very favorable if not unprecedented economic DIP,” said Kelley A. Cornish, a lawyer for ABG-BB, LLC the name of the joint venture between Authentic Brands and Simon Property.Brooks Brothers will organize a court-supervised auction in the coming weeks that should attract a lot of competition, Fail said“We have had active discussions with multiple bidders,” Fail said.As it struggled to restructure outside of court, the company closed 51 stores and shut down manufacturing in Massachusetts, North Carolina and New York. When Brooks Brothers filed bankruptcy July 8 only 18 stores were open in the U.S. The company has 1,400 locations in 45 countries. Because of the pandemic, the company has furloughed 4,025 workers.The case is Brooks Brothers Group Inc., 20-11785, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.(Updates to add winning lender in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brooks-brothers-gets-bankruptcy-loan-204437753.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-07	2020-07-07 17:24:39	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Goldman Sachs Picks 2 Stocks to Buy (and 1 to Sell)	Is it time to rain on the parade? Or is it time to buy into the markets? That’s what investors must decide. And according to Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs, they may need to make up their minds quickly.Goldman starts by pointing out what we all know, that the S&P 500 is up almost 40% from its low point in the last week of March. That’s an amazing rally, but the bank’s analysis team warns that 2H20 may not be quite as upbeat as the first six months. The bank’s team predicts an annualized growth rate of 25% in Q3, down from the 33% forecast earlier.The rise in corona cases and the reinstatement of social and economic restrictions forced the change in outlook. According to Jan Hatzius, chief economist, “The recent declines are minor compared to the collapse in activity in March and April, but they clearly indicate a break from the steady upward trend since mid-April.”The bank believes the downward trend will be real, but likely short-lived; even red-state Texas has imposed a mask mandate. It is like that as state and local authorities nationwide, along with more grass-roots initiatives, push for increased precautions, the corona tide will slowly recede. So, markets may go any which way. And to protect your portfolio, Goldman Sachs’ stock experts have tapped two equities that you should buy – and one that you should avoid. We’ve pulled up the details from the TipRanks database, to find out what lies behind these calls.Simon Property Group (SPG)First on the list is a real estate investment trust, Simon Property Group. This company is both the largest shopping mall operator in the US, and the largest retail REIT. In normal times, owning and operating high-end shopping destinations is a lucrative niche; but with the coronavirus and the shutdowns, SPG has faced heavy headwinds in the first half of this year.Start with Q1. The company reported earnings below expectations, and a 20% drop in profits. The key Funds from Operations metric, which is used by analysts as an indicator of the general health of REITs, was down over 8% year-over-year, to $980.6 million. At the same time, the company started reopening its properties – in line with local policies – in the first half of May, and this week announced a $2 billion issue of senior notes, sold in three tranches due in 2025, 2030, and 2050.As part of the mixed picture for SPG, the company also slashed its dividend payment by 38%, from $2.10 to $1.30. The new dividend was declared on June 29, and represents an annualized payment per share of $5.20. At that rate, despite the cutback, the yield remains an impressive 7.54%.The company’s liquidity and dividend got the notice of Goldman Sachs. In the bank’s report on REITS, they recommend buying SPG. Analyst Caitlin Burrows writes, “We believe that the size and strength of SPG’s balance sheet is a positive differentiator for the company. Given its A rating by S&P, we expect SPG to access the unsecured market at attractive pricing in 2020 and further bolster its liquidity position.”Caitlin puts a $94 price target on SPG, suggesting the stock has a 41.5% upside for the coming year.Overall, SPG gets a Hold from the analyst consensus – Wall Street is inclined toward caution here, where Goldman Sachs is willing to take a risk. The stock has 13 recent reviews, breaking down to 4 Buys, 8 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are selling for $66.69, and the average price target of $80.08 indicates a potential upside of nearly 21% over the next 12 months. (See SPG stock analysis on TipRanks)Brixmor Property (BRX)Next on our list, Brixmor Property, is another big name in retail property ownership. Brixmor is decidedly mid-market, where SPG above is high-end; BRX’s top three tenants are TJ Maxx, Kroger, and Dollar Tree. The company has built a strong niche in the mid-market, however, and came into 2020 with a solid position: over 400 shopping centers, with more than 71 million leasable square feet.The nature of Brixmor’s business helped ensure a steady stream of shoppers, even during the height of the corona crisis. With Kroger as the 2 tenant, the company did not see rental income slip as much as some other REITs. EPS slipped only slightly sequentially, from 47 to 46 cents per share in Q1. On a negative note, management suspended the dividend payment starting in Q1, stating that they would revisit the policy on a quarterly basis going forward.The company has been taking efforts to shore up liquidity, and in June closed a purchase offer on existing senior notes due in 2022. The sale brought in over $182 million, or 36.5% of the outstanding principal amount on the notes.Goldman Sachs' Caitlin Burrows expressed her confidence in the strength of the company's portfolio, noting “BRX owns a portfolio of Open Air properties across the United States, which we believe will be an advantage in this current retail environment. Strip Centers offer competitive retail supply versus enclosed malls on the basis of pricing and also benefit from higher exposure to essential tenants as well as the concentration of retailer store openings which are among BRX’s top 40 tenants.”To this end, Caitlin rates BRX a Buy along with an $18 price target. This implies a 37% one-year upside.The analyst consensus here is a Moderate Buy, based on 6 Buys, 7 Holds, and 1 Sell set in recent weeks. Shares are selling for $12.46, and the average price target of $13.68 suggests a 10% upside from current levels. (See BRX stock analysis on TipRanks)Macerich Company (MAC)Goldman Sachs' Caitlin Burrows isn’t all bullish on REITs. She is also initiated coverage on Macerich, another retail-oriented real estate trust, with a Sell rating. Macerich is the third largest owner/operator in the US shopping mall sector, and boasts over 50 million square feet of leasable retail space.After a strong fourth quarter, Macerich saw earnings drop sharply during the corona crisis. Q1 EPS was 81 cents, down over 18% from Q4. Top-line revenues also slipped, by 6%, to $221 million. The stock’s share price has behaved as might be expected – MAC collapsed badly during the Feb-March bear market, and still has not recovered. The stock is down 59% from its February levels.At the same time, there are some bright spots. Macerich in mid-June announced that all of its retail properties were open for business again, a positive leading indicator for 2H20. And, at the end of May, the company declared its regularly quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share – but there was a twist. The dividend was paid partly in cash – up to 10 cents per share – and the balance in shares of common stock.That was an important point for Burrows. The analyst laid out her view of MAC as follows: “We believe MAC’s high portfolio quality is overshadowed by its elevated leverage, limited access to debt, and potential dividend risk.”Looking at details, Burrows noted of the company’s leverage: “MAC’s leverage has been negatively impacted by lower EBITDA over the past few years.” And about the dividend, Burrows acknowledges the current hybrid payment but is not sanguine of the future: “Having reduced the total common stock dividend less than peers, there could be further dividend reductions given the company’s pressured balance sheet and liquidity.”This is the stock that Goldman says to Sell. In line with that, the bank puts a $6.50 price target, suggesting a downside for the coming year of 21%.Overall, the Moderate Sell rating on MAC is based on 7 Holds and 3 Sells from the analyst consensus. At $8.25, and with an average price target of $8.22, the stock is not going to move from here, at least according to these analysts.

2020-06-29	2020-06-29 06:00:41	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	The Mall Can’t Survive If There Aren’t Any Stores	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Rent collection day last Wednesday looked like a disaster for mall landlords in the U.K. Reeling from the coronavirus lockdown, tenants including JD Sports Fashions Plc, Boots drugstores and Primark withheld some payments pending negotiations with landlords. Estimates vary widely as to how much was paid of the 2.5 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) due — from 10% to 50%.This isn’t just bad news for Lakeside mall-owner Intu Properties Plc, which on Friday collapsed into administration. Missing rents affect everyone, including property developers Hammerson Plc and British Land Co.Whatever the final tally, the balance of power between retailers and their landlords has indelibly shifted. The days when well-known retail chains signed 25-year leases dictating that rents only rose were already largely consigned to history. But the retail apocalypse wrought by Covid-19 means that landlords have no choice but to accept even shorter leases and far more flexible terms with a good dose of the right services thrown in.  As I have argued, the pain from the pandemic must be shared between retailers and property owners on both sides of the Atlantic. The future of the mall depends on it.Brick-and-mortar outlets were already facing existential questions from the rise of Amazon.com Inc. and other online retailers, and many traditional retailers had started to embrace e-commerce too. Covid-19 is accelerating this shift. At the end of last year, digital accounted for about 30% of U.K. retail sales excluding food. This could increase to more than 40% over the next year or so, according to independent retail analyst Richard Hyman.The trend makes store economics even more challenging. Moving sales online has its own costs, from stock management to processing returns, which can’t be offset with a commensurate reduction in store expenses. And now retailers have to invest to adapt their shops to social-distancing rules.With such pressure on profits, some stores will inevitably have to close. Those that don’t will have to cut costs, and that includes rent. In order to better manage cash flows, it’s imperative they be allowed to move to monthly rent payments from quarterly ones.Another option is for landowners to offer so-called turnover rent deals based on a proportion of in-store sales, usually underpinned by a minimum fee. This model, already common in off-price retail parks, aligns everyone’s interests. It gives mall owners an incentive to make their properties as appealing to customers as possible, with a pleasant environment, concierge services and a good mix of tenants covering retail, food and leisure. And retailers would be more inclined to sign for a longer period.The downside for property companies is more uncertainty because they cannot count on a guaranteed income stream to pay down their debt. Still, this is probably better than an empty unit.As push comes to shove, it’s best relations stay cordial. After all, retailers have promised to pay their landlord, and rent that hasn’t been collected during the pandemic isn’t written off. Yes, there’s a case for leniency when chains are clearly in distress. But it’s harder to justify withholding what’s due when retailers have remained largely open, such as Boots, or are in good shape financially, such as JD Sports. There are good reasons to encourage constructive dialogue. Store chains that take an aggressive stance may be exposing themselves to legal action. In the U.S., Gap Inc. is facing suits from Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners LP. Plus, now that leases are much shorter, discussions over the proper rent come around much more frequently. When they do, companies that paid in full during the crisis may be able to secure better terms than those that reneged.With no let up in the ferocity of retail competition, it’s smart to strike more favorable deals in the future. But any tense moments should be saved for the contract negotiations, not quarter day. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-06-19	2020-06-19 19:16:51	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: AAPL, SPG, RCL, APT	Quad witching day, one of four each year, pulled the rug out from under a lot of traders on Friday. On Thursday we warned about the potential headaches it would cause and we're seeing it play out today. Let's look at a few top stock trades for next week. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Apple (AAPL)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares turned lower on the day after the company announced it would close its retail locations in several states getting hit the hardest by the novel coronavirus.This created a ripple effect -- as we'll discuss in a moment -- as Apple was one of the first retailers to close down earlier this year due to Covid-19.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLook, this stock has been very resilient, pushing through its prior highs earlier this month and racing all the way over $350. Shares could not sustain above the 123.6% extension from the March low to the February high, which came into play at $353.31.  * 10 Robotics Stocks on the Technological Cutting Edge Now, pulling back, I want to see if uptrend support (blue line) holds as support. Falling below that puts the 20-day moving average in play. A dip below that puts the $325 breakout level on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Simon Property Group (SPG)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com Now let's talk about Apple's ripple effect, as shares of Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) take it on the chin on Friday.Shares are breaking below $70 support and the 20-day moving average on Friday, after losing uptrend support (blue line) on Thursday. This is telling price action for traders, as they now look to see if the 50-day moving average can act as support.Below the 50-day puts sub-$60 levels in play with no real support on the table until shares start to firm up and show us where buyers are willing to buy SPG. $50 is a far-off but possible downside target if the selling accelerates.On the upside, see if Simon Property stock can reclaim $70 and the 20-day moving average. Climbing above that puts $80 to $85 back in play, but let's go one step at a time. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Royal Caribbean (RCL)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com Negative news this week in the cruise industry didn't do Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) any favors, but neither did the news from Apple.Shares are breaking below the 20-day moving average on the day, down almost 7% as of this writing. RCL stock is also losing the $55 to $56 area. While not vital necessarily, it has proven significant over the past few weeks.On a deeper decline, see if the $48 to $50 area acts as support. Moving below that puts the 50-day moving average and uptrend support in play, along with the 23.6% retracement at $46.33. I would consider this a key area and a zone where bulls should (theoretically at least) want to buy RCL stock.Falling below that puts sub-$40 in play and would be concerning price action in the short term.On the upside, see if RCL stock can reclaim the 20-day moving average. Above that puts $65 to $68 in play, followed by a possible retest of $75. Let's see where support comes into play before we get too gutsy. Remember, RCL rallied almost 300% from the lows. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Alpha Pro Tech (APT)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com After a month-long lull, Alpha Pro Tech (NYSEAMERICAN:APT) is finally back with some momentum. Shares are up more than 75% from this month's low and almost 35% from this week's low.The latter is mostly fueled by Thursday's roughly 15% gain. After reclaiming the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, shares are rallying into resistance near $16 to $17.50. If it can clear this zone, $20-plus is possible.On a dip, see if the 20-day and 50-day moving averages hold as support. If they fail, it will mean APT stock also lost uptrend support (blue line). Below $12 and the $9 to $10 zone is possible. This is a wild mover, so check your discipline before stepping in.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-06-18	2020-06-18 19:02:37	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Making Sense Of Taubman's Counterclaim Against Simon Property	Mall owner Taubman Centers, Inc. (NYSE: TCO) is taking legal action and says Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE: SPG) has no right to terminate the merger agreement between the companies. What Happened: Simon agreed to acquire Taubman for $3.6 billion, or $52.50  per share, in February. The larger mall owner is looking to break the deal due to the COVID-19 pandemic.On Wednesday, Taubman filed a counterclaim and said Simon is having &quot;buyer's remorse,&quot; CNBC's David Faber reported on &quot;Squawk on the Street.&quot;&quot;The Simon Parties agreed to a series of merger transactions with the Taubman Parties ... on February 9, 2020, at a time when the parties and the world were well-aware of the risks of the novel coronavirus pandemic,&quot; Faber quoted the legal papers as stating.Taubman further argues that Simon Properties agreed to accept risks related to the pandemic.Why It's Important: Simon's original legal complaint includes a &quot;weak&quot; argument, but that doesn't mean it ultimately won't succeed in the legal battle, Faber said.A Simon spokesperson commented on Taubman's legal complaint, Faber said.&quot;The Merger Agreement explicitly provides that a pandemic that has disproportionately affected Taubman compared to others in the retail real estate industry gives Simon the right to terminate the Agreement,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;Nowhere in its extensive legal filing does Taubman seriously contest that it was not disproportionately impacted.&quot;What's Next: Under a worst-case scenario, Simon would have to proceed with its prior plans to acquire Taubman, Faber said.Taubman investors appear to be betting on an acquisition, he said, or the stock would be &quot;a lot lower&quot; and &quot;not be anywhere&quot; near $37 per share.Taubman shares were up 0.13% at $37.43 at the time of publication, while Simon Property Group shares were higher by 0.36% at $71.93.

2020-06-15	2020-06-15 19:18:33	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	J.C. Penney Faces a Tricky Rescue	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A familiar band of fixers may be coming to J.C. Penney Co.’s rescue. Can they do it again?Major mall operators Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners LP, along with Authentic Brands Group LLC, are in talks to buy the bankrupt department store chain, Bloomberg News reported Monday. This coalition has taken similar action before, rescuing teen clothing retailer Aeropostale several years ago and, more recently, buying fast-fashion mainstay Forever 21 out of bankruptcy. However, J.C. Penney should approach such an arrangement with caution, because it’s going to be uniquely difficult to make this one a win-win situation. Covid-19, of course, has turned the commercial real estate and retail worlds upside down. Thanks to an accelerated post-pandemic pace of e-commerce adoption, analysts at UBS now forecast that the U.S. will see about 100,000 store closures by 2025. Against that backdrop, Simon and Brookfield have even more incentive than usual to do whatever it takes to simply preserve occupancy of their shopping centers. J.C. Penney may not currently be paying its landlords huge sums since anchor tenants typically enjoy relatively low rents, but mall operators generally want to keep the lights on at as many stores as possible to keep their centers feeling vibrant and bustling.   J.C. Penney has already pledged to shutter more than 150 of its 800-plus stores. The chain likely needs to close many more than that to become a healthy business. But doing so could be at odds with what’s good for Simon and Brookfield at this perilous moment.  Plus, J.C. Penney isn’t just any mall retailer: it’s an anchor tenant, meaning it has huge footprints with their own entrances. Those boxes could be significantly harder to fill than, say, Aeropostale-sized stores, even in the best of economic times. But, as Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lindsay Dutch points out, the kinds of tenants that might be good fits for one-time J.C. Penney stores —  hotels, gyms, or even offices — might be harder to line up now that we’re in a recession and the pandemic is making every one of those businesses rethink their formats. The result could be that Simon and Brookfield get control over what replaces empty J.C. Penney stores, which is helpful to protecting their overall mall profiles. But in the meantime, J.C. Penney may suffer brand damage if some of its locations are allowed to limp along with little investment for a long time while it undertakes that process. There would be some upsides to this potential buyout for J.C. Penney: The group’s rescue of Aeropostale is widely perceived as a success. And Brookfield had earlier pledged to put $5 billion toward helping retailers recover from the devastating effects of stay-at-home orders and a recession, a sign that J.C. Penney would be getting a partial owner that is deeply invested in saving not just the struggling retailer, but the entire mall ecosystem. Meanwhile, the CEO of Authentic Brands, Jamie Salter, told CNBC recently, “I think there is a play for J.C. Penney. I think J.C. Penney needs a purpose. And I have my ideas on what it should be.” It’s good that Salter understands returning J.C. Penney to health would have to be more than a cost-cutting exercise; it has to be a holistic reimagining of what a department store should be. Still, J.C. Penney would do well to consider the tricky dynamics of this moment for the retail and real estate industries. They might point to another suitor – Sycamore Partners is reportedly one – being its best shot at protecting its storied brand.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-06-15	2020-06-15 18:55:41	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Mall Landlords, Authentic Brands in Talks to Buy J.C. Penney	(Bloomberg) -- The two largest mall landlords and Authentic Brands Group LLC are in talks to buy bankrupt department-store chain J.C. Penney Co., according to people familiar with the matter.Authentic Brands may team up with Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners LP to acquire the retailer as part of its court reorganization, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The discussions are still fluid and may ultimately end without a deal.J.C. Penney, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in May, has been racing to firm up a business plan by a July 14 deadline, after which the company risks running out of cash to finance its reorganization and emerge from bankruptcy court. The company’s proposed exit plan involves creating two new publicly traded entities, including a real estate investment trust that would hold some of the retailer’s property.For the landlords, buying J.C. Penney would ensure the survival of one of their most ubiquitous tenants amid a wave of retail distress that has seen thousands of stores close permanently. That’s in addition to the pandemic lockdown that shuttered most retailers for months nationwide.Authentic teamed up with Simon and Brookfield to buy teen clothing chain Forever 21 out of bankruptcy earlier this year. And Authentic and Simon are also in discussions with Brooks Brothers Inc. on a joint bid that would be part of a potential bankruptcy filing by that clothing retailer, Bloomberg News reported last week.Brookfield, the second-largest U.S. mall operator after Simon, in May announced the creation of a $5 billion fund to buy stakes in retailers.Authentic also owns Aeropostale after teaming up with the mall landlords to buy that brand out of bankruptcy in 2016. Its growing portfolio could be a boon to J.C. Penney if licensed product from those retailers were added to the department store’s lineup.Private equity firm Sycamore Partners has also held preliminary talks to buy J.C. Penney, weighing an acquisition outright or making an investment in the retailer, Reuters reported earlier this month.J.C. Penney’s remaining value includes its owned real estate and intellectual property from its private brands, according to David Silverman, a retail analyst at Fitch Ratings.“The different companies that are potentially looking into J.C. Penney have different capabilities and options given the real estate that J.C. Penney has and the suitors’ potential use with it,” Silverman said.(Adds context on company’s reorganization plan in third paragraph and commentary from an analyst in the last paragraph.

2020-06-12	2020-06-12 16:14:52	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Brooks Brothers Joins List of Faded Luxury Facing Bankruptcy	(Bloomberg) -- Another icon of luxury goods and Wall Street culture may be headed for the bankruptcy auction block, with Authentic Brands Group LLC and mall landlord Simon Property Group Inc. in talks to buy Brooks Brothers Inc.Authentic and Simon would team up to bid for the two-century-old chain after a potential Chapter 11 filing by the retailer, according to people with knowledge of the talks. They asked not to be identified because the process is private. Authentic has a history of buying well-known brands that have fallen on hard times, and Simon, the nation’s biggest mall landlord, has a stake in keeping its prime tenants in business.It’s been a tough few years for high-end goods, even before the Covid-19 outbreak forced Brooks Brothers to temporarily close its stores. Retailers including Barney’s New York Inc., Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and Dean & DeLuca have gone bust as shoppers shunned malls in favor of online outlets.“These aspirational-type brands can expect a bumpy year ahead,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Deborah Aitken, who monitors the luxury market. The Brooks Brothers brand hasn’t made “enough of a transition to leisure, street and athletic wear.”Relaxed dress codes also hurt Brooks Brothers, with suits and ties no longer the standard even at blue-chip corporate offices, top Wall Street brokerages and white-shoe law firms where Brooks Brothers clothing was once a status symbol. It didn’t help that the pandemic pushed would-be customers to work from home and forced the cancellation of weddings and other formal events, cutting down on demand for new clothing.Representatives for Authentic Brands and Brooks Brothers declined to comment. A representative for Simon didn’t immediately comment.Authentic and Simon have teamed up before on similar deals to rescue Forever 21 Inc. and Aeropostale Inc. On its own, Authentic bought Barneys New York Inc. out of bankruptcy.Mall operators like Simon, meanwhile, have been stepping up their involvement following a wave of store closings and bankruptcies. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. created a $5 billion fund this year to buy stakes in retailers.Brooks Brothers dates to 1818, when it opened its first store in downtown Manhattan, not far from what is now the city’s financial center. Its suits became the uniform of the Wall Street macher, but as it expanded, it opened more stores selling lower-priced goods in malls and on Main Streets, some of which are dragging on its performance now.British merchant Marks & Spencer bought the company in 1988, then sold it to billionaire Claudio del Vecchio in a deal completed in 2002.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brooks-brothers-joins-list-faded-161452927.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-10	2020-06-10 21:29:19	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Mall Owner Simon Property Nixes Deal to Buy Rival Taubman	(Bloomberg) -- Simon Property Group Inc. is terminating its $3.6 billion bid to buy Taubman Centers Inc., arguing that its rival mall owner has breached the merger agreement by not taking steps to mitigate the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.Simon said in a statement on Wednesday it has “exercised its contractual rights” to terminate the deal, which was announced in February before the pandemic battered malls. The company said it was asking a court to declare that Taubman has suffered a “material adverse event” and “breached the covenants in the merger agreement.”Taubman’s shares plunged more than 40% after the statement was released, before paring the losses. The stock finished Wednesday down about 20% at $36.17, the biggest single-day drop since December 2008.Taubman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Simon also dipped on Wednesday, sliding 4% to $83.01. The stock had rallied recently on hopes for a faster than expected economic recovery.Simon also dipped on Wednesday, dropping as much as 9.8% to $78. Its shares had rallied recently on hopes for a faster than expected economic recovery.Taubman’s shares have been trading below the proposed deal price of $52.50 for months, raising speculation that the deal was in trouble or that Simon would seek to lower its bidLower Price?The move by Simon on Wednesday could be a negotiating tactic, according to Lindsay Dutch, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Taubman could try to force Simon to close the original deal, but it might make more sense to work something out at a lower price, according to James Sullivan, an analyst at BTIG.“The downside in Taubman shares might be as low as in the 20s if the deal didn’t close,” Sullivan said. “They have every incentive to negotiate a price cut and the question just becomes how much is appropriate.”Simon and Taubman are two of the largest U.S. mall owners, and the deal was seen as a way for Simon to bulk up in its battle to retain shoppers increasingly drawn to the convenience of e-commerce.Simon’s properties include Roosevelt Field, outside New York City, while Taubman owns Beverly Center in Los Angeles and Dolphin Mall in Miami.Tough ProspectsProspects for bricks-and-mortar retail have changed dramatically since the deal was announced. Stay-at-home orders to curb the spread of Covid-19 have shuttered stores, pushing more consumers online.Landlords, already pressured by declining foot traffic and retailer bankruptcies, may face a wave of new vacancies as the pandemic forces more tenants out of business.While Americans stuck inside for months have shown a willingness to return to stores, there are major challenges ahead for enclosed malls.Simon argued in the statement that Taubman had failed to make “essential cuts” in operating expenses and capital expenditures and that the company’s properties have been hit particularly hard by the outbreak.“Taubman’s significant proportion of enclosed retail properties located in densely populated major metropolitan areas, dependence on both domestic and international tourism at many of its properties, and its focus on high-end shopping have combined to impact Taubman’s business disproportionately due to the Covid-19 pandemic when compared to the rest of the retail real estate industry,” Simon said.(Updates shares.

2020-06-10	2020-06-10 18:36:50	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Pandemic Turns Simon’s Mall-Merger Math Upside-Down	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Malls have been falling out of favor with Americans for years. But the calculus surrounding which have the best chances of surviving and which are destined for decline was flipped on its head by the coronavirus pandemic. That helps explain the news on Wednesday that mall giant Simon Property Group Inc. wants to call off its planned purchase of Taubman Centers Inc.A portfolio of higher-end malls in urban areas that cater to domestic and international tourism was one reason Simon agreed to pay a 70% premium for rival Taubman in February. Those same outposts are now a liability as the pandemic turns consumers off from crowded indoor venues and grinds travel to a halt. And that may give Simon the argument it needs to successfully walk away from the merger. Simon said Wednesday it’s seeking to terminate the $3.6 billion deal, arguing that Taubman had experienced a “material adverse event” amid the pandemic and had breached its obligations under the merger agreement by failing to make “essential” cuts in expenses to deal with the fallout. While the agreement stipulates that a pandemic doesn’t on its own give Simon the grounds to walk away, there’s an exception if the company can prove Taubman has experienced a “disproportionate adverse effect” relative to others in the industry. That’s where those higher-end, urban malls come into play.  While the pandemic is far from over, there appears to be a growing consensus among epidemiologists that outdoor activities are less risky than indoor ones. The owners of the largest open-air strip centers collected 50% to 65% or more of rent due in April, compared to just 10% to 30% for mall and outlet owners, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lindsay Dutch observed in a recent note. It also helps that many of those strip centers are anchored by grocery stores or other outlets that were allowed to stay open through the pandemic because they sell essential items. CNBC reported that Taubman intends to contest Simon's termination of the deal and legal claims and will move ahead with a shareholder vote on June 25.Is this short-sighted? Maybe. The idea that we are forever destined to favor strip malls in suburban areas over luxury malls in cities strikes me as debatable. Indeed, Simon shares fell nearly 10% at one point on Wednesday and were still down about 3% in the early afternoon, suggesting shareholders believe something is being lost here. As my colleague Tara Lachapelle wrote in February when the deal was first announced, scale of operations and breadth of balance sheet should be an asset in mall owners’ quest for survival.But it’s still the right move for Simon to get out of the Taubman combination if it can. The all-cash deal and assumption of Taubman’s debt would have significantly inflated Simon’s leverage at the worst possible time, given the company’s own struggles to extract rent from shuttered retailers. Simon earlier this month sued Gap Inc., claiming the company failed to pay $65.9 million in rent for March through June. Including the coronavirus hit to the retail environment, the deal may have boosted Simon’s debt to 7.5 times its Ebitda, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Ki Bin Kim estimated in a report on Wednesday.Simon’s argument for getting out of the deal is logical “in the court of common sense,” Bin Kim wrote. But in the court of law, “we don’t know.” The second half of Simon’s argument — that Taubman has breached the covenants of the merger agreement by failing to make significant cost-cuts — is arguably trickier. While Simon has said it’s suspended or eliminated more than $1 billion of capital development projects, cut executive salaries and implemented temporary furloughs, Taubman has been more measured, announcing the deferral of as much as $110 million of expenditures. But aggressive job cuts and cost-control measures by Taubman could have given Simon more ground to argue the business was in a disproportionately dire situation, Bin Kim writes. “It could have been one of those things that `you’re damned if you do, and you’re damned if you don’t,’” he said. That should be something of a motto for a mall industry that feels perpetually stuck on the wrong side of trends. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.For those who don't have the time to tune in live or listen to the podcast, Benzinga will highlight one stock that merits further discussion. This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation.For those who thought first-quarter earnings season was going to be a disaster for all stocks, especially ones involved in the retail or commercial real estate sector, think again. Since the COVID-19 crisis and corresponding stay-at-home policies weren't instituted until late March, for the most part it was business as usual for many companies until the last few weeks of the quarter.As a result, the reports from many companies weren't that bad. This scenario applies to Simon Property Group (NYSE: SPG), which reported results after close on Monday, making it the PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day.What They Do And What They DidSimon Property Group, Inc. is an American commercial real estate company, the largest retail real estate investment trust, and the largest shopping mall operator in the U.S. Its portfolio is made of more than 325 properties that operate under five different real estate platforms.In early February, SPG paid a hefty premium ($52.50) to purchase 80% of Taubman Centers (NYSE: TCO). At that time., Simon shares were worth $142. The stock now trades at the $55 level and Taubman Centers can be had for $40 a share.Major Top In July 2016One of the first victims of the &quot;Amazoning&quot; of the world was large malls and their operators. When purchases could be made so easily online, the need for going to a mall or similar retail centers was no longer a necessity. As a result, these monstrosities that were expensive to build and costly to maintain were confronted with lower and lower foot traffic.View more earnings on SPGAlong these lines, huge per square foot tenants such as Macy's (NYSE: M) and JC Penney (NYSE: JCP) began to close stores.While the S&P 500 index had appreciated handsomely since July of 2016, this issue has gone in the other direction. In fact, it has shed 75% of its value since it peaked in July 2017 at $229.10.No Mercy During Market RetreatAs the COVID-19 crisis gripped the world and stay-at-home-policies were instituted the markets began to crumble, Simon went along with it. Whereas the S&P 500 index fell 35% from peak to trough, SPG fell from Feb. 21 high ($142.77) to $42.25 on April 2 -- a 70% decline.Only five days after hitting rock bottom, the issue rallied 75% when it peaked at $74.17, but it has been unable to hold onto those gains. At the current price of $55, it's only 30% off its April low.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index has tacked on over 60% and is trying for more. Keep in mind, it much easier to rally in percentage terms from a much lower price point, which is the case between Simon and the S&P 500 index.Moving ForwardAfter the close on Monday, the company announced first-quarter fund from operations of $2.78 down from $3.04 year over year. The bright spot is sales come in above estimates at $1.35 billion versus estimate of $1.29 billion.The Street focused on the sales beat as the issue peaked just off the open at $60.54 and continues to make news lows for the session and unchanged for the day at $55.08.Long before the COVID-19 crisis, Credit Suisse made a bold call in May 2017 and reiterated in June 2018 on the mall sector. That being the firm expected 25% of U.S. malls to close by 2022. In view of recent events, they may be considering shortening that timetable.See more from Benzinga  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: AMC Entertainment  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Trade Desk  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Beyond Meat(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-04-17	2020-04-17 16:06:55	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	7 Real Estate Stocks to Watch as the Long-Term Impact of the Virus Looms	"We are truly in uncharted waters. We're seeing economic numbers the likes of which last happened in the 1930's. The unemployment rate seems to be heading to 20% or higher, and U.S. GDP growth could hit some staggering figure like -20% or -25% in coming quarters. The shock is going to have a huge impact on the properties, and in particular, real estate stocks. Houses, offices, shopping malls and more -- investors are suddenly questioning what everything is worth.To understand the impact on the real estate market in general, we reached out to James P. Gaines, chief economist, Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. He told InvestorPlace that:""First, nobody knows at this point exactly how the pandemic is going to affect the real estate markets, but there is little doubt that it will have significant impacts. These impacts will first be the immediate short-run effects of much slower to near stoppage of new transactions -- residential and nonresidential -- while the economy is shut down and people are sequestered.""InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy For Portfolio Strength In Uncertain Times So which real estate stocks in particular might be hit significantly by the novel coronavirus' longer-term impact? Here are seven that stand out:  * Lennar (NYSE:LEN)  * Invitation Homes (NYSE:INVH)  * Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG)  * First American Financial (NYSE:FAF)  * Zillow Group (NASDAQ:Z) (NASDAQ:ZG)  * Realogy (NYSE:RLGY)  * Home Depot (NYSE:HD)Let's take a deeper look into why each of these companies face big challenges from the resulting economic slowdown. Real Estate Stocks to Watch: Lennar (LEN)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com How will a near stoppage of real estate transactions end up affecting the market? The first area of concern is the housing market.Housing was the catalyst for the 2008 financial crisis, and investors are wondering if a similar fiasco could happen this time around as well. While the housing market and banking system seem healthier now than they were then, questions remain. Mr. Gaines told us that he expects to see:""Home sales fall tremendously once we work thru the backlog of signed contracts awaiting closing.  This may take a month or so and the market is working on doing remote, online closings without having to actually attend a closing in person.  Adding to the problem, of course, are the problems of appraisal and inspections that historically require a physical inspection. A very positive policy move was the prohibition on foreclosures and evictions for failing to make mortgage or rent payments. It remains to be seen how we will work through the financing chain from household payments to securitized mortgage bond defaults.""Homebuilders like Lennar are obviously in the line of fire if these delays with contracts, inspections and closings drag on. Homebuilders tend to have a fair chunk of leverage. And their business relies on selling high-ticket items. As a result, an economic slowdown can wreck havoc on their cash flow if transactions dry up.Lennar looks cheap though, trading at just 9x earnings. And home purchases had been booming right up until the quarantines started. The Federal Reserve's massive rate cutting campaign has generated dirt-cheap mortgage rates, and has given folks more buying power. At this point, it's not clear if consumers will feel comfortable buying given the economic stress. If they do, however, LEN stock could come roaring back. Invitation Homes (INVH)Source: Shutterstock It isn't just homebuilders that are nervous about the economic slowdown. There are publicly traded real estate investment trusts that solely focus on owning and renting out homes, and traders have sold those as well.To give one example of a company in this space, look at Invitation Homes. It has more than 80,000 units around the country, with most of those being single-family houses. It primarily owns houses in strong economies with growing demographics. Its biggest markets include California, Florida and the fast-growing Atlanta metro market, among others.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever Invitation completed its initial public offering in 2017. It's still a relatively new company, and as such, it has been in aggressive growth mode. Until the market crash, INVH stock had traded sharply higher. Now, however, it's back near its IPO price. While the dividend yield is a modest 2.5% for the time being, the REIT is priced to give a strong capital gain if and when the housing market picks back up again. Simon Property Group (SPG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Remember, housing is far from the only part of the real estate market that will face a massive impact from the coronavirus' economic shock. Mr. Gaines explained the potential impact on commercial real estate:""Forbearance is the operative word in the commercial sectors. Landlords will have to be patient with tenants' ability to pay their rent. But really, they won't have much choice as there won't be any other tenants available to replace them.""Simon Property Group is the nation's largest mall REIT, and one of the highest-quality ones as well. The Simon family wisely spun-off its weaker malls into Washington Prime Group (NYSE:WPG) years ago. Washington Prime has lost nearly all its value; however, Simon held onto the best malls and until March 2020, it appeared to be in decent shape. Despite the retail apocalypse, Simon had enjoyed rising rents and sales at its top-tier properties.But all that is in danger now. Simon's stock has plummeted from $150 to as little as $40 during this bear market. While Simon has a fantastic balance sheet, investors are rightly concerned that the virus will cripple the company's cash flows going forward. That's particularly true as even high-end tenants with seemingly robust finances like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and The Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE) have decided to withhold part or all of their rent payments going forward. With rent in doubt, it's not certain how Simon will react. One thing's for sure: Dividend investors shouldn't rely on Simon's 13% yield for sleep-well-at-night income right now. First American Financial (FAF)Source: Shutterstock Turning back to the housing market, there's a lot more in play than just housing REITs and homebuilders. You have a bunch of other companies that are tied to the housing ecosystem. For example, take First American Financial, which is one of the nation's largest title insurers. Title insurance is a service that banks require in order to provide a mortgage. The title insurer is response for guaranteeing that a property's deed is in good standing. In the event of a problem with the mortgage, the title insurer may end up liable for damages if legal issues arise.What do title insurers get in return for providing this necessary, if mundane, service? Fat fees, generally. Title insurers tend to earn a premium in proportion to the dollar amount of a real estate transaction. Thus, they have double leverage to the housing market. A booming market causes more transactions, and also increases the dollar amount per transaction, resulting in bigger fees. Needless to say, the downside is painful as both those levers run in reverse.That said, the major title insurers did fairly well even in 2009, and this crisis shouldn't be as bad for the industry as that one. For one, there was no major housing bubble this time around. There also doesn't appear to have been much fraudulent mortgage underwriting in recent years, unlike 2008, which should reduce realized insurance losses for companies like First American.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip While FAF stock dropped as much as 50% in the crash, shares should rebound quickly. Shares trade for just 8x normal-year earnings at this point and yield 4%. Demand for the product isn't going anywhere -- remember, title insurance is mandatory for new mortgages. Also, the Fed's interest rate cuts should drive more refinancing; a refinanced mortgage produces a fresh title fee for First American as well. Zillow (Z) (ZG)Source: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com Zillow is another fascinating housing stock to watch during this crisis. You probably know the company for its popular real estate website. On Zillow, you can track housing prices, get estimates for properties, see what's on the market and much more.However, more recently, Zillow made a huge switch to its business model. In addition to its traditional housing information portal, the company decided to get into the house-flipping game on its own. In theory, the company would have advantages in buying and selling houses thanks to its wealth of market information. It seemed like a dream job for big data analytics.Alas, it hasn't panned out -- at all -- so far. For full-year 2019, the company's traditional businesses made a net profit of $7 million. Not great, but it was in the green at least. The home-flipping segment, however, lost more than $300 million, causing Zillow overall to take a big loss. The company projected better days ahead for 2020, but analysts were skeptical toward ZG stock as 2019 was a good year for the housing market, but Zillow still lost tons of money.For now, Zillow is suspending much of its real estate buying and selling program to conserve capital. It's also slashing other expenses to try to ride out the economic slowdown. However, investors aren't convinced. ZG stock lost as much as 70% of its value recently before bouncing moderately. If the housing market takes a leg lower, Zillow could face real trouble. Realogy Holdings (RLGY)Source: Shutterstock For another angle on the real estate market, take a look at Realogy Holdings. This company is one of the biggest real estate services companies in the U.S. It has a unique approach, as it has acquired a bunch of leading brands spanning things such as real estate agents, content providers, insurance services and more.Notable brands include Coldwell Banker, Better Homes And Gardens Real Estate and Century 21.Unfortunately, given the abrupt plunge in economic activity, Realogy has found itself in a bind. With few buyers willing to act during the stay-at-home period, transaction fees are few and far between. As a result, Realogy has had to slash costs; the CEO accepted a 90% pay cut, for example. The company also tapped a $400 million line of credit. Still, with RLGY stock down from $12 to $3.60, investors are clearly skeptical that Realogy will make it through okay.  * 10 High-Yield Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy If you are bullish on housing coming back more quickly than expected, RLGY could be a stock to pick up at rock bottom prices. Home Depot (HD)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Finally, when you're watching real estate, you should have an eye on Home Depot. As a hardware store, it may not be quite the first thing that comes to mind when you think of real estate stocks. However, Home Depot is closely tied to the home building and home repair industries. As a result, Home Depot is often the No. 1 or No. 2 largest holding within homebuilder industry exchange-traded funds.Some analysts are already warning about HD stock given its housing exposure. On Wednesday, for example, Wedbush's Seth Basham warned that HD stock is expensive and more levered to the cyclical sales than rival Lowe's (NYSE:LOW).Basham left Home Depot at just a neutral rating, saying that the stock is still expensive, even after its recent decline. With Home Deport at 20x earnings heading into a real estate market downturn, that's a reasonable call to stay on the sidelines for now.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

2020-04-17	2020-04-17 13:30:47	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Wells Fargo: 2 Big 13% Dividend Stocks to Buy (And 1 to Avoid)	After almost 4 weeks of bullish trading, investors are growing used to the idea that we’re in a true rally. Yes, markets are still down from their February peak; yes, the coronavirus epidemic is still going strong; and yes, the lockdowns in place to combat the virus’ spread are still wreaking havoc on the economy – but for now, at least, the stock markets are trending up.On Wall Street, Chris Harvey, Wells Fargo’s head of equity strategy, sees opportunities in current market conditions. “Destruction in stock prices has really uncovered a significant amount of value,” Harvey says, although he does add a warning that investors should avoid companies with “fundamental issues” resolvable under current conditions. He specifically points out the travel and leisure sectors as particularly hard hit right now.But within what he describes as the best risk/rewards, the Wells Fargo team believes investors can find strong returns.That in mind, what exactly is Wells Fargo recommending? We’ve used the TipRanks database to sort through the investment firm’s stock picks, and found some commonalities: at least 20% upside potential, combined with 13% dividend yields – and also one that may be too risky to try.Simon Property Group (SPG)We’ll start with a real estate investment trust, a segment well-known for high and reliable dividends. The Simon Property Group focuses on retail properties, and is known as the largest operator of shopping malls in the US. SPG has over 325 properties across 37 states, and boasts over 240 million leasable square feet of high-end retail property. The company finished 2019 on a strong note, with $1.5 billion in final quarter revenue and $7.1 billion in liquid assets.Even with the difficult quarter now, SPG has maintained its generous dividend. The quarterly payment is a $2.10, making the annualized payout an impressive $8.40 and the yield an equally impressive 13.72%. SPG has been raising the dividend steadily over recent years, and the payout ratio is now 70%, showing that the company can afford the payment – and has room to increase it again.Tamara Fique covers this stock for Wells Fargo, and sees fit to give a Buy rating. Her review includes a bullish $130 price target, implying a healthy upside potential of 112% for the coming year. (To watch Fique’s track record, click here)Backing her stance, Fique points out all of the current weaknesses in the shopping mall industry: declining customer traffic, closed shops, a halt in tourist traffic, and reduces her 2020 and 2020 FFO estimates. At the bottom line, however, she states, “The regional mall industry has consolidated into the hands of a few public REITs that benefit from their scale, access to capital, and strong tenant relationships. Those REITs with national platforms and high-quality portfolios are likely to attract the best tenants and the best personnel. Simon is the largest of these consolidators.”Overall, Simon Property boasts a Moderate Buy consensus rating with 6 recent Buy ratings vs. 7 Holds. Meanwhile the average price target of $130 indicates upside potential of 128%, with the stock down 64% year-to-date. (See Simon Property stock analysis at TipRanks)Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD)Investment management is a core function of Wall Street’s major banks, and Goldman Sachs BDC lives squarely in that niche. The company is the specialty finance subsidiary of the eponymous investment banking firm that figured prominently in the 2008 financial crisis. GSBD focuses on closed-end management investment for middle-market companies in the US.Through 2018, and into 1H19, GSBD strongly exceeded its earnings expectation. In the last few reported quarters, however, the bank has just managed to meet those forecasts, with Q3 and Q4 earnings coming in at 47 and 48 cents respectively. Looking ahead, the Street expects to see 49 cents EPS, for another small sequential gain.Along with modest gains in earnings, GSBD offers investors a steady – and rock-solid reliable – dividend, with uninterrupted payments going back five years. The quarterly payment, 45 cents, annualizes $1.80 and gives a yield of 13.84%. This is almost 7x higher that the average dividend yield found in the broader markets, and while GSBD has kept the payment steady, rather than increasing it gradually, the reliable payout and high yield combine to make it a steady income stream for shareholders – and an attractive point for income-minded investors.Well Fargo analyst Finian O’Shea saw fit to upgrade this stock from Neutral to Buy, setting a $15.75 price target that indicates a potential upside of 21%. (To watch O’Shea's track record, click here)In supporting comments, O’Shea wrote, “We are upgrading GSBD… given attractive leverage profiles in this environment… We are increasing our target yields to account for wider market spreads, and believe the space is attractive given implied loss rates and overall funding stability.”The average price target on GSBD is $16.25, which suggests room for 24% growth from the current trading price of $13.51. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 1 Buy rating and 3 Holds set in recent weeks. But the main attraction here is the steady dividend return. (See Goldman Sachs stock analysis on TipRanks)Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)With the third stock on our list, we get to Wells Fargo’s Sell recommendation. Bed Bath & Beyond is a staple of the suburban retail market, with branches in shopping malls and stand-alone locations. The company specializes in homewares, sheets and towels, cooking and baking accessories, soaps, shampoos, and other hygiene products – a niche that you think might do well in today’s hygiene-conscious coronavirus epidemic, but the lockdowns have brought shopping to a near-standstill and that is the deciding factor in this case.Oddly, initial numbers might suggest otherwise. BBBY’s fiscal Q4, which ended in February of this year, showed an 80% positive surprise as EPS came in at 38 cents against a forecast of 21 cents. At the same time, quarterly earnings were down from $1.20 year-over-year, a 68% drop.However, the company’s fiscal Q1, which will cover a time frame directly impacted by the anti-coronavirus measures, is looking decidedly glum. March sales are tracking down 32%, and quarter-to-date is down 42%. The company is looking to retrench, and has suspended $600 million in share buybacks and debt reduction while pushing $150 million capital expenditures into 2021. It’s not a pretty picture, especially when all of the company’s stores are closed and it is shifting all sales to an ecommerce platform, and adjusting to changes in upper management.Even BBBY’s dividend, once considered solidly reliable, is not safe. The company paid out the 17-cent regular quarterly payment last month, but future dividends are uncertain. At current share price levels, the dividend gives a whopping 15.3% yield, impressive by any standard – but affordability is the question.All of this prompted Well Fargo’s 5-star analyst Zachary Fadem to rate BBBY a Sell, with a $4 price target that suggests a 9% downside from current levels this year. (To watch Fadem's track record, click here)Fadem opined, “Considering BBBY’s pre-COVID challenges were already steep, we’ve long viewed a turnaround requiring considerable efforts. But with management now juggling actions to reduce costs, shore up liquidity and quickly shift sales to ecommerce, we view the path ahead increasingly onerous for BBBY’s newly minted leadership team.”Overall, Wall Street appears to agree with Fadem that caution is required here. The analyst consensus on this stock is a Hold, based on 13 ratings that include 3 Buy, 8 Holds, and 2 Sells. However, the average price target of $10.11 reflects the potentially high rewards sometimes seen with high risk shares, implying a 46% upside should the economy see a V-shaped recovery.

BofA Downgrades Simon Property Amid Unprecedented Challenges In Retail	Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE: SPG) and its mall peers are likely to face unprecedented challenges and uncertainties even when the world reopens after the lockdowns, according to BofA Securities.The Simon Property Group Analyst Craig Schmidt downgraded Simon Property from Buy to Neutral, raising the price target from $56 to $62.The Simon Property Group Thesis Although Simon Property's stock has underperformed over the past year, it has risen recently and is trading more than 48% higher than its lows, warranting the rating change, Schmidt said in the note.The lack of visibility for retail real estate is now more than it has ever been. The global shutdowns are unprecedented, and it is yet unknown when the lockdowns will end. There's no surety around when or whether tenants will pay rent and several lawsuits are likely to follow.Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world. For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter.Schmidt said there is also low visibility into the damage to consumer balance sheets, confidence and the impact on future discretionary spending. He added that there is the risk that consumers may not visit enclosed centers even after the lockdowns open.There is also the increased risk of retail bankruptcies, store closings and finding replacement tenants. He added, however, that Simon Property's long-term prospects remain intact.SPG Price Action Despite the downgrade, shares of Simon Property rose almost 4.4% to $68.12 on Tuesday.Latest Ratings for SPG  DateFirmActionFromTo  Apr 2020CitigroupMaintainsNeutral  Mar 2020Morgan StanleyMaintainsEqual-Weight  Mar 2020Deutsche BankUpgradesHoldBuy    View More Analyst Ratings for SPG   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * Chinese Streaming Service iQIYI Has Subscription Revenue Opportunity, Oppenheimer Says In Bullish Initiation  * FedEx Gets Upgrade On Increased Barriers To Entry, Express-Ground Integration  * BofA Downgrades Caterpillar, Says Energy Problem Is Here To Stay(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-03-30	2020-03-30 13:40:12	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	3 Under-The-Radar Dividend Stocks With Over 8% Dividend Yield	What’s the most important investment metric an investor can focus on in the midst of a downturn? My vote is cash flow. It’s actually a great thing to track during any economic cycle – it just becomes especially important when a firm’s sales and profits head south when the business climate turns turbulent.Don’t just take my word for it. A quote attributed to market guru Michael Mauboussin is that “great fundamental investors focus on understanding the magnitude and sustainability of free cash flow.”Income-minded investors, such as retirees looking to supplement their social security checks with, could have some real opportunities to pick up bargains during the current market dip.  It’s obviously difficult to determine if we already have or will soon hit bottom in the current downturn, but it’s fair to say that many companies will survive with their dividend payments intact.Using TipRanks database, we've narrowed down three stocks that have well above-average dividend yields right now. In fact, the current reported yields are above 8%, or between four and five times the stock market (as measured by the S&P 500) average of closer to 2%. The sustainability of their payouts obviously depend on how long the economy remains in standby mode as social-distancing is utilized to fight off the covid-19 pandemic, but there appears to be ample cushion for the below players, based off of recent historical financials and analyst expectations.Simon Property (SPG)Indianapolis-based Simon Property is a bellwether Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) and bona fide leader in leasing out mall-based retail space. It is also in the midst of acquiring rival Taubman Centers to further consolidate its leading position.In each of the last three years Simon has generated around $3 billion in free cash flow. That’s almost unheard of in the REIT space where companies very often either spend the vast majority of their operating cash flow on acquisitions or maintaining and improving their existing properties.Simon does pay out most of its free cash flow in the form of partnership distributions, which is its dividend. For the last three years it amounted to $2.9 billion, $2.8 billion, and $2.6 billion. But even if that were cut during the current downturn, it’s hard to see it falling significantly from current levels over the long haul. Overall, Simon pays out $2.05 per quarter. At $8.40 annualized, the dividend gives a yield of 13.53%, which is more than 5 times higher than the average dividend in the S&P 500.Deutsche Bank's Derek Johnson believes Simon will “navigate the continuing retail evolution while maintaining an industry leading balance sheet which is poised to withstand the COVID-19 disruption and fund the (re)development pipeline with $7.0B of incremental liquidity.”Johnson recently upgraded his rating on Simon to Buy from Hold.  He also has a price target of $120, which is more than double the current share price of $58 per share.  That would be quite a share price performance, in addition to the well above-average dividend payment. (To watch Johnson's track record, click here)Based on 12 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 6 rate a Buy on SPG stock, while 6 maintain a Hold. The 12-month average price target stands at $134.25, marking a nearly 130% upside from where the stock is currently trading. (See Simon stock analysis on TipRanks)Dow Inc (DOW)Chemical giant and Dow Jones Industrial Average component Dow just can’t catch a break. In December 2015, it announced a transformative merger to join forces with archrival DuPont, which took two years to complete. Then, the combined firm announced a transformative deal to break into three more distinct business that took a couple of years to reach fruition. That break up was completed a little less than a year ago, meaning the company is still getting its footing while the economy is on hold due to covid-19.Dow is one of these three children (DuPont and Corteva are the other two) and is a much leaner materials science firm focused on  performance materials, industrial chemicals, and specialty plastics. Its products page lists hundreds that form the building blocks for its customers. Think additives, cleaners, binders, and lubricants for other companies.DOW has been using its cash flow generation to maintain a strong dividend. The company’s quarterly payment, 70 cents, annualized to $2.80, for an impressive yield of 9.80%. That’s four times the average yield among S&P listed companies, and is powerful incentive for investors.Analyst earnings estimates are quickly being cut due to the new reality. Lead analyst James Sheehan at sell-side firm SunTrust now expects EPS of $2.65 for this year, down from $3.53.  His models suggest free cash flow of $5.7 billion, which, though down is far from a doomsday scenario.  That should be plenty of cushion to support what should be a couple of billion dollars to maintain the dividend.That said, Sheehan believes the negative sentiment is already reflected in DOW's share price and valuation. The analyst noted, &quot;We believe valuation of 5.9x 2020E EBITDA more than fully discounts these headwinds, and believe DOW’s FCF generation will entice investors as COVID-19 impacts recede.&quot;As a result, Sheehan reiterates a Buy rating on DOW shares along with $47 price target, which implies nearly 65% upside from current levels. (To watch Sheehan's track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street almost evenly split between the bulls and those choosing to play it safe. Based on 13 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 6 rate DOW a Buy, while 7 say Hold. Notably, the 12-month average price target stands at $44.25, marking a nearly 55% in return potential for the stock. In other words, even the analysts that are hedging their bets have some healthy optimism reflected in expectations. (See DOW stock analysis on TipRanks)Prudential Financial (PRU) Insurance and asset management giant Prudential Financial’s share price has had a tumultuous few weeks, to say the least.  The stock hovered just below $100 per share in early February and bottomed (hopefully) below $40 last week.  The stock has since recovered slightly to $53.Prudential provides insurance, investment management, and related financial products. One side effect of the efforts to prop the economy up while the world focuses on quarantining is interest rates have fallen further and are scraping around 0%. This hurts the prospects for insurance companies, and especially life insurers that hold many long-dated bonds. And falling financial markets means less investment fees across the board.Calculating free cash flow for a financial firm is less straightforward, but at a recent investor conference, Prudential management detailed that cash flow is about 2/3 of earnings, which it targets to either pay out as dividends or share buybacks. That would be more than $8 per share, or quite a big cushion to pay out an annual dividend of $4.40 per share. This gives a yield of 8.05%As you might expect, analysts are lowering their earnings estimates and price targets for Prudential. Analyst John Barnidge at Piper Sandler lowered his price target from $80 to $74 in a recent report. That still represents upside of 51% from current levels and back the analyst's Buy rating. (To watch Barnidge's track record, click here)Barnidge's full-year EPS estimate only fell a dime to $12.20, though it is down $0.90 to $13.60 for 2021. This follows management guidance on how a drop in rates will affect earnings the next couple of years.Barnidge points out that the cushion could be way less if financial markets continue to really struggle. Another recent report is published detailed that new inflows of assets it manages held up pretty well in February. Revenue from insurance premiums and fees, as well as investment income and investment management fees could still reach $60 billion this year and next.Overall, Wall Street is not convinced just yet on this insurance and investment firm, but cautious optimism is circling, as TipRanks analytics demonstrate PRU as a Buy. Based on 10 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 4 rate Prudential a Buy, 4 say Hold, and only 1 recommends Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $80.60, marking a 52% upside potential from where the stock is currently trading.

2020-03-04	2020-03-04 15:33:22	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Hedge Fund Guru Israel “Izzy” Englander Bets on These 3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks	Hedge fund giant Izzy Englander managed a rare feat in life, when he turned his youthful interest in financial markets into a billion-dollar career. He started trading stocks as high school student, and opened his first brokerage in 1977 when he was 30. Eleven years later, in 1988, he raised $35 million in seed money and hung out the shingle of Millennium Management. He continues to serve as CEO of Millennium, which now holds more than $224 billion in assets under management.Through his years of stock trading, Englander has held fast to a set of simple, basic rules in in all of his investments: Keep a lid on the risk, stick to non-directional trading strategies, and maintain the tight discipline required to stay with the first two rules. This combination of common-sense market savvy and discipline has guided Englander as he built his own fortune up to $6.6 billion.Englander’s most recent 13F filing showed several new positions for his firm, and some of them share a few important attributes. Looked at through the lens of the TipRanks Stock Screener tool, these new positions hold Buy ratings among Wall Street’s analyst corps, and all show a dividend yield above 5%. Let’s take a closer look, to find out what else drew Englander to these investments.Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG)First up is a real estate investment trust. Simon Property Group inhabits the retail segment of the REIT business, owning, developing, and managing a variety of regional malls, outlet centers, and other high-end retail spaces. The company is based in Indiana, and has operations across the United States and Canada. SPG is the largest mall operator in the US, with over 325 properties totaling more than 240,000,000 square feet.SPG keeps up a generous dividend. The quarterly payment is $2.10, large in absolute terms as dividend payments go, and annualizes to $8.40 per share. The yield is an impressive 6.7%, far higher than the near-2% average among SPG’s S&P peers. The payout ratio is high, at 70%, but shows that there is still some slack available and that the company can maintain the dividend payment at current income levels.With this in mind, Englander’s firm picked up 118,259 shares of SPG in Q4 2019, making the fund’s first position in this stock. The market value of the holding, at current prices, is over $14.4 million.Wall Street is also bullish on SPG. Weighing in from Barclays, 5-star analyst Ross Smotrich places a Buy rating on the stock, with a price target of $191, suggesting an upside of 55%. (To watch Smotrich’s track record, click here)Backing his view, Smotrich noted: &quot;We continue to view SPG as the strongest positioned retail REIT to withstand industry challenges given its best-in-class properties, financial flexibility, solid balance sheet and liquidity position ($7.1 bln); in addition, management has demonstrated its focus on operations, cost structure, active portfolio management to achieve outstanding results for the company. SPG currently trades at a 28.7% NAV discount and 11.8x forw ard P/CAD multiple, a 9.8 turn discount to the broader REIT average (21.6x). In the interim, it is difficult to find a stock yielding 6.1% with a single A corporate debt rating.&quot;All in all, SPG’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 4 Buys and 5 Holds set in recent weeks. The stock’s $158.33 average price target implies a premium of 29% from the current share price of $123.16. (See Simon Property stock analysis at TipRanks)Medical Properties Trust (MPW)As its name suggests, Medical Properties Trust is an REIT that focuses on hospitals and other health care facilities. The company has properties in the US, the UK and mainland Europe, and Australia. In addition to health care facility real property, the company also owns interest in several health care providers. MPT saw $854.2 million in revenue for 2019.Investors can trust MPW’s dividend; the company has an 11-year history of keeping up reliable payments, and the March increase is the third in the past three years. The dividend annualizes at $1.08, for a yield of 5.01%. This is almost 2.5x the average among S&P listed companies, and almost 4x the yield of Treasury notes.The attraction for Izzy Englander is clear, and it’s no wonder why he bought up 536,840 shares in MPW, which are now worth $11.9 million. Since the end of Q4, the value of this purchase has appreciated by over $600,000.Barclays analyst Steven Valiquette likes what he sees in this company, saying bluntly, “MPW is on track to generate the highest FFO growth of any company in the HC REIT sector in 2020 and 2021, driven by a recent wave of investment activity.”Valiquette puts a $27 price target on this stock, backing his Buy rating and suggesting an upside of 17%. (To watch Valiquette’s track record, click here)Also bullish is Jonathan Petersen, 5-star analyst with Jefferies. He says of MPW, “We continue to expect MPW's stock performance to depend on its ability to execute on its acquisition pipeline. With MPW’s strong balance sheet and continued appetite for further acquisitions, we see MPW continuing to grow into a healthy FFO/sh run rate throughout 2020, with further upside potential given somewhat conservative estimates on acquisitions beyond 2020.”Petersen rates MPW a Buy, and gives it another $27 price target. (To watch Petersen’s track record, click here)All in all, Medical Properties gets a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 7 Buys and just a single Hold. The stock is selling for $23.28, and the average price target of $24.50 suggests room for a 5% upside. (See Medical Properties stock analysis at TipRanks)Weyerhaeuser Company (WY)Last on our list is a major player in the North American timber industry. Weyerhaeuser owns some 12.4 million acres of timberland in the US, along with 14 million acres in Canada. The company produces a wide variety of timber, lumber, and other wood products. WY is incorporated as an REIT, deriving its income from royalties and production leases on the lands it owns.WY has showed net growth over the last year, even accounting for the recent downturn. Shares are up a modest 11% in the last 12 months, and yoy the company shifted from a net loss in Q4 2018 to a positive EPS of 2 cents in Q4 2019. Net income for the quarter was $14 million on $1.5 billion in revenues.The solid quarter supported the dividend payment, of 34 cents. Annualized, this comes to $1.36 per share, or a yield of 5.1%. As with the other stocks on this list, the yield is significantly higher than investors will find in other S&P assets or in the bond market. WY has a 9-year history of keeping up reliable dividends.Growing profitability and a steady income stream likely attracted Englander to this stock, and his firm snapped up 656,956 shares, the largest buy among the stocks on this list. Millennium’s WT holding, another new position for the firm, is currently worth $17.56 million.Stephens analyst Mark Connelly writes of WY, “Timberlands and wood products were stronger, and RE was slightly weaker than we expected… Management appears to have dropped its &quot;dividend growth&quot; story in favor of a &quot;sustainable dividend&quot;, which makes more sense given the business. We see no serious risk to the dividend.”Connelly’s $32 price target implies an upside here of 17%, supporting his Buy rating. (To watch Connelly’s track record, click here)5-star RBC Capital Analyst Paul Quinn gives an even more bullish $35 target to WY stock, suggesting a 28% upside to go along with his Buy rating.In his comments, Quinn says simply, “Weyerhaeuser reported Q419 results that were in line with our forecast, with continued efficiency in its Wood Products segment... We think Weyerhaeuser is well positioned to benefit from lower interest rates and a stronger building season.” (To watch Quinn’s track record, click here)Net net, Weyerhaeuser’s Strong Buy analyst consensus is unanimous, based on 3 Buy ratings. Shares are priced at $27.38, and the average price target of $33 indicates room for a 20% upside potential.

2020-02-25	2020-02-25 22:07:05	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Oracle Reveals Funding of Dark Money Group Fighting Big Tech	(Bloomberg) -- When the Internet Accountability Project popped up late last year and joined the growing crusade against Big Tech, the nonprofit group refused to say who was financing it.Turns out, at least one of its benefactors is Oracle Corp.Oracle donated between $25,000 and $99,999 last year to the internet project, according to a new political-giving report Oracle posted on its website. The group calls itself a conservative nonprofit advocating for tougher privacy rules and stronger antitrust enforcement against the internet giants.The IAP financing is just one part of an aggressive, and sometimes secretive, battle Oracle has been waging against its biggest rivals, including Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.Oracle spent years fighting to unseat Amazon as the front-runner for a lucrative Pentagon cloud contract, which was awarded to Microsoft Corp. in October.The Redwood City, California, company has also been locked in a decade-long legal dispute with Google, claiming the search-engine giant violated Oracle copyrights by including some Java programming code in the Android phone. Oracle acquired Java’s developer, Sun Microsystems Inc., in 2010.Earlier this month, IAP filed an amicus brief supporting Oracle’s position in the case. IAP said it wants to “ensure that Google respects the copyrights of Oracle and other innovators.” The U.S. Supreme Court on March 24 will hear oral arguments in the Google v. Oracle America case.The Trump administration on Feb. 19 also urged the Supreme Court to reject Google’s appeal in the case. Its brief appeared the same day that Larry Ellison, Oracle’s co-founder and chairman, hosted a high-dollar fundraiser at his Rancho Mirage estate for President Donald Trump. The event prompted about 300 Oracle employees to stage a protest the next day. The U.S. had previously supported Oracle as the case wound its way through the courts.Oracle’s donations disclosure reveals that it contributed to at least four other groups that filed supportive briefs in the Supreme Court case. Google has also donated money to at least 10 groups that have filed briefs on its behalf in the high court case.Oracle and Amazon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment about the Oracle disclosure. Google declined to comment.IAP President Mike Davis said in a statement the group doesn’t disclose its financial backers but specified that Oracle didn’t fund its Supreme Court brief.The internet project was launched in September by Davis, a former aide to Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and Rachel Bovard, a former aide to Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. The group aims to “lend a conservative voice to the calls for federal and state governments to rein in Big Tech before it is too late,” according to its website.The IAP is a Section 501(c)(4), known as a “social-welfare” organization. That designation means it isn’t required to disclose donors as long as it doesn’t spend more than half of its money on campaign advertisements or activities to sway an election.Among other policies, IAP supports curtailing Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which shields tech companies from liability for content that users post on their platforms. The clause saves tech companies from having to review content before it’s published online, and then shields them from lawsuits if that content turns out to be problematic.Earlier: Barr Takes Aim at Legal Shield Enjoyed by Google, FacebookIn interviews and on social media, IAP has supported Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has proposed that tech companies lose the legal immunity unless they can prove to the Federal Trade Commission that they treat their content in a politically neutral manner.Since September, IAP has tweeted at least 11 times about Hawley’s legislative efforts against Google and other tech companies. Other IAP tweets highlight instances in which Google-funded groups fought on the internet giant’s behalf.“Holy smokes you guys, DC is awash in @Google money,” Bovard tweeted in September.Davis, the group’s president, wrote last week on Townhall.com that Google’s battle with Oracle is “the poster child for what we at IAP call ‘the Great 21st Century Internet Heist.’” He said the company “is anathema to conservatives and everything we stand for,” without disclosing that his group is funded by Oracle.Earlier: It’s the Kochs vs. the Mercers in the Right’s Big Tech BrawlOracle claims Google owes it at least $8.8 billion for using the Java code without a license. Google argues it was fair to use parts of the programming language to help Android communicate more easily with other software.The case has split Silicon Valley by pitting software makers who favor stronger copyright protections against companies that rely on others’ code to produce new innovations.Other CampaignsIAP is far from the only anti-tech group Oracle has funded. It also gave between $25,000 and $99,999 to the Free and Fair Markets Initiative, according to the disclosure.Free and Fair Markets claims it is a grassroots coalition of businesses and advocacy groups fighting for a better economy. In practice, it has focused more on publicizing negative reports about Amazon. The Wall Street Journal reported that Oracle, Walmart Inc. and the Simon Property Group had financed the group.For the last two years, Oracle has also waged a multi-front battle against Amazon over the Pentagon’s Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, cloud contract. The deal, which could be worth $10 billion over a decade, is designed to transition much of the Pentagon’s data into one commercially operated cloud system.For more: Oracle’s Catz Is Said to Talk Amazon Contract Row With TrumpAmazon was seen as the leading contender because it had already won a major cloud contract with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and had obtained high levels of security clearance. The move to Amazon’s cloud would have threatened Oracle’s legacy database business with the Defense Department.Oracle led a coalition of other tech companies, including Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., to oppose the Pentagon’s decision to award the contract to a sole bidder. In addition to lobbying Congress and the Trump administration, Oracle also filed -- and lost -- challenges through the Government Accountability Office and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.Oracle is currently appealing a July ruling that it lacked standing to challenge the contract.(Updates with comment from IAP in paragraph 11)&#92;--With assistance from Greg Stohr.To contact the reporters on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.net;Joe Light in Washington at jlight8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Paula DwyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-reveals-funding-dark-money-220705147.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-02-25	2020-02-25 20:18:16	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Forever 21 Just Named a Former H&M Exec as its New CEO — What That Means for its Future	Forever 21 is placing its bets on a new executive chief — one who previously served two decades at rival fast-fashion giant H&M.Today, Authentic Brands Group — one of the teen mall staple's new owners in a consortium of buyers that also includes Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners — announced the appointment of Daniel Kulle as Forever 21's CEO. The position formerly belonged to Do Won Chang, who, along with wife Jin Sook Chang, founded the retailer in 1984.&quot;Forever 21 enjoys strong brand awareness and affinity, a clear consumer set and quick-to-market capabilities, allowing the brand to be nimble and leverage key trends and create strong value for its customers,&quot; Kulle said in a statement. &quot;The strong ownership structure, which combines ABG's marketing prowess with Simon and Brookfield's retail real estate expertise, creates a foundation for long-term growth.&quot;Kulle most recently held the role of strategic advisor to former H&M Group CEO Karl-Johan Persson, who in January became chairman of the board at the Swedish firm.  (Helena Helmersson replaced Persson as CEO.) Kulle also served as president of H&M North America, helping expand the firm's e-commerce and brick-and-mortar presence in the region, where sales grew from $1 billion to $4 billion annually.In his new role, Kulle is tasked with using his digital expertise to enhance Forever 21's content and social media strategies. He will also helm the retailer's sustainability initiatives — a key tentpole as it enters its next chapter under new ownership.&quot;Daniel is a well-respected, progressive fashion executive, and we are thrilled to welcome him to the team,&quot; ABG founder, chairman and CEO Jamie Salter said in a statement.Simon chairman and CEO David Simon added, &quot;Knowing Daniel personally for several years, I've seen his tenacious working style firsthand. His strategic vision and experience will build on Forever 21's heritage and undoubtedly usher in a new era for the brand.&quot;Last week, Forever 21 was snapped up by ABG, Simon and Brookfield. As part of the acquisition, ABG and Simon each own 37.5% of the fast-fashion retailer, while Brookfield takes control of the remaining 25% of Forever 21's intellectual property and operating businesses.With changing preferences among its target shoppers, who are increasingly turning to e-commerce for fashion, Forever 21 in September joined a rapidly expanding list of retailers that have filed for Chapter 11 protection in a bid to restructure and rightsize their store fleets. At the time, it estimated that its assets were on par with liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion.

2020-02-10	2020-02-10 17:27:44	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	A Mall Landlord's Survival Guide: Buy Up All the Best	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In the retail apocalypse, only the strongest can survive. It’s why the Taubman family, among the biggest mall landlords in the U.S., is throwing in the towel after 70 years and ceding control to its larger rival, Simon Property Group Inc. The merger had long been seen as an inevitability, if a bitter reality for the Taubmans, who watched their company’s stock recently descend to a 2009 recession low. Mall operators are looking for ways to strengthen their portfolios, and these two in particular share similarities.Both run higher-end shopping destinations, such as Taubman Centers Inc.’s The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey and The Gardens Mall outside Palm Beach, Florida, as well as Simon’s Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Central Valley, New York. Still, neither company has been shielded from the pain of retail bankruptcies and shuttered storefronts. When Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy last fall, it was Taubman’s biggest tenant.(1) The timing of the family’s decision to sell reinforces the downcast mood in brick-and-mortar retail.After on-and-off talks between the two longstanding mall dynasties — like Taubman, Simon is led by the son of its own founder — the deal finally came together on Monday. Simon agreed to acquire Taubman for $3.6 billion in cash, or $52.50 a share, 70% higher than the stock’s average closing price for the last 20 trading sessions. The substantial premium shows just how eager Simon was to do the deal and what it took to get Taubman on board. The family will retain a 20% interest in Taubman Realty Group LP, the entity that holds its real-estate interests. For Simon, adding Taubman’s properties may help offset the sour outlook it gave investors during a recent earnings announcement. It had projected that funds from operations — a key cash-flow metric for real estate investment trusts (REITs) — will be $12.25 to $12.40 per diluted share in 2020, which was below some analysts’ expectations and signaled relatively weak growth for the year. Simon’s stock has rebounded 6% since Bloomberg News broke news of its negotiations with Taubman last week. It's a harsh retail environment, and while U.S. malls aren’t yet being demolished on a grand scale, less than half of them may ultimately survive, according to Lindsay Dutch, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. On the bright side, those left standing could get even stronger as tenants seek out the best remaining shopping locations, Dutch wrote in a Dec. 11 report.Joining forces may ensure Simon and Taubman are in the latter camp. But selling now, with the stock in the dumps rather than on its way to a recovery, means the Taubmans didn’t see better days ahead. (1) Simon also happens to be part of a group trying to buy the fast-fashion retail chain.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-02-10	2020-02-10 14:35:14	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Simon to Buy Taubman for $3.6 Billion to Fight Retail Slump	(Bloomberg) -- Simon Property Group Inc. agreed to buy rival U.S. shopping-mall operator Taubman Centers Inc. for about $3.6 billion, a combination that comes as e-commerce continues to roil brick-and-mortar retail.Simon will pay $52.50 a share in cash for all of Taubman’s common stock, the companies said in a statement Monday. That’s about 51% more than Taubman’s closing share price on Friday. Simon said it expects to fund the purchase with existing liquidity.Taubman’s shares surged as much as 54% to $53.25. Simon was little changed at $141.27 as of 9:34 a.m.Simon and Taubman had been holding on-and-off discussions about a deal since late last year. The agreement comes as a wave of retail bankruptcies have squeezed mall-oriented REITs, putting pressure on the industry to consolidate.The rise of e-commerce has more U.S. consumers shopping from home, making it harder for brick-and-mortar retailers to survive. That’s weighed on malls, which are struggling to boost foot traffic. While both Taubman and Simon have fared better than some competitors during the recent retail turbulence, the shares of both companies have slumped over the past 12 months.Still, Simon was looking for a way to expand, and was attracted to Taubman’s portfolio of mall properties in a bid boost growth, according to Lindsay Dutch, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.“There are not many opportunities to grow in the retail landscape,” she said.The company needs to focus on its U.S. malls, which have been hurt by store closings, and the deal may make room for that, according to Dutch. The purchase makes sense for Simon, given Taubman’s high-quality, well-located malls and Simon’s ability to reinvest in them, she wrote in a report Monday.The deal would mark the end of family control of Taubman, one the pioneers of the American mall industry. Founder Alfred Taubman was one of the first developers to capitalize on the explosive growth of America’s suburbs. He built an empire of highly successful upscale regional malls, including The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey, Woodfield Mall outside Chicago and Beverly Center in Los Angeles.The agreement announced on Monday allows the Taubman family to retain an ownership stake in its malls.Simon has flirted with other acquisitions in recent years. It previously tried to purchase Taubman as well as the shopping center REIT Macerich Co.Elsewhere in the industry, there’s been consolidation. In 2018, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, known as Unibail-Rodamco SE at the time, acquired shopping-center operator Westfield Corp. while Brookfield Asset Management Inc. bought mall-operator GGP Inc.Taubman has relatively high exposure to Forever 21, which declared bankruptcy in September. Simon is also a landlord for the retailer and is part of a group trying to buy the chain.Taubman has faced activist pressure in recent years. Investor Jonathan Litt won a board seat at the company in 2018 after a closely contested proxy fight. He chose not to run for re-election last year.(Updates with share prices.)&#92;--With assistance from Mark Schoifet.To contact the reporter on this story: Oshrat Carmiel in New York at ocarmiel1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Craig Giammona at cgiammona@bloomberg.net, Christine Maurus, Steve DicksonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/simon-buy-taubman-3-6-143514483.html?.tsrc=rss

Forever 21 Has $81 Million Bid From Simon, Brookfield, Authentic	(Bloomberg) -- A group including two of Forever 21 Inc.’s biggest landlords has offered to buy the bankrupt retailer for $81 million, a fraction of what the international fashion pioneer was once worth.The consortium of Simon Property Group Inc., Brookfield Property Partners LP and Authentic Brands Group LLC is seeking to buy substantially all of the company’s assets, according to documents filed Sunday in federal bankruptcy court.The so-called stalking horse agreement sets a minimum price for a proposed auction later this month. If no other bidders step forward, the consortium would be declared the winner.The agreement calls for a court hearing on the deal no later than Feb. 13 and court approval by Feb. 18, the documents show. The would-be buyers have the right to close and wind down certain stores and conduct going-out-of-business sales, according to the filing. They’re also entitled to a $4.65 million break-up fee under some circumstances if the sale isn’t completed.Exit StrugglesForever 21 had been in “substantial, round-the-clock negotiations” about the bid, the Los Angeles-based company said in documents filed last week.Bloomberg previously reported that Authentic Brands and Simon Property were mulling a plan to acquire the retail chain. Forever 21 was talking about selling a stake to Simon and its other largest landlord, Brookfield Property Partners LP, before it filed for bankruptcy in September, Bloomberg reported in September. Negotiations broke down and the company had to seek court protection without a reorganization plan in place.The chain has since struggled to raise money to exit bankruptcy, with potential lenders and buyers balking because of poor sales and the founding Chang family’s insistence on maintaining control. Forever 21 recently told suppliers in a letter reviewed by Bloomberg that it’s short on cash and that it could be forced to liquidate if a buyer doesn’t emerge.As part of the stalking-horse bid, the potential buyers deposited almost $13.5 million in connection with the sale, and any competing bids would have to deposit 10% of the cash purchase price up front, according to court filings.The case is Forever 21 Inc., 19-12122, District of Delaware (Delaware).(Adds new timeline and buyer deposits starting in fourth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Jeremy Hill.To contact the reporter on this story: Eliza Ronalds-Hannon in New York at eronaldshann@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Rick Green, Shannon D.

The ultimate goal is a transaction that preserves Forever 21 as a going concern, they wrote.The filing includes a proposed stalking-horse agreement but doesn’t name a potential bidder.

2020-01-24	2020-01-24 19:59:20	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Simon Property, Authentic Brands Consider Buying Forever 21	(Bloomberg) -- Mall owner Simon Property Group is considering a bid to buy Forever 21 Inc., the bankrupt teen retailer that’s running out of money and time, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Simon would pair with Authentic Brands Group LLC to buy and operate the stores and the brand, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The talks are continuing, and there’s no guarantee that the various sides will agree on terms or that a sale will result.Representatives for Los Angeles-based Forever 21 and Simon didn’t respond to messages seeking comment, and Authentic declined to comment.Forever 21 was talking about selling a stake to Simon and its other largest landlord, Brookfield Property Partners LP, before it filed for bankruptcy in September, Bloomberg previously reported. Talks broke down and the company had to seek court protection without a reorganization plan in place.The chain has since struggled to raise money to exit bankruptcy, with potential lenders and buyers balking because of poor sales and the founding Chang family’s insistence on maintaining control.Supplier AppealForever 21 told suppliers in recent weeks that it’s short on cash and that it could be forced to liquidate if a buyer doesn’t emerge. It asked them in a letter to ship goods on credit while talks continue with a potential buyer, which it didn’t name.The retailer is unable to borrow more money, and “therefore is turning to you in an effort to continue operating,” Forever 21 said in the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Bloomberg. Failure to find a new owner could force it into liquidation, the company wrote.Forever 21 expects to provide information on the potential buyer in the coming weeks, according to the letter.Half PaymentThe bankrupt retailer proposed to give suppliers half of what they’re owed in cash for goods delivered between Jan. 20 and Feb. 4. They’d be paid in the week following receipt of the goods.The other 50% of the payment owed would be deemed an unsecured “superpriority” administrative claim in the company’s bankruptcy proceedings, ranking behind Forever 21’s lenders for repayment.The arrangement would need approval from a judge overseeing the bankruptcy case.To contact the reporters on this story: Lauren Coleman-Lochner in New York at llochner@bloomberg.net;Eliza Ronalds-Hannon in New York at eronaldshann@bloomberg.net;Kiel Porter in Chicago at kporter17@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/simon-property-authentic-brands-consider-195920562.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-13	2019-12-13 11:00:03	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Simon Property Group Is Preparing Its Balance Sheet for Armageddon	Shopping centers continue to die, leaving behind vast swaths of undeveloped parking lots. This undiscovered country makes Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), the largest owner of shopping malls in the United States, worthy of investment.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com But if that doesn't excite you, take time to consider the dividend, $8.40 over the last year with a yield of 5.6%. That's what you get with a real estate investment trust. These companies are required to give you their earnings.While best known for owning giant malls like the 110-acre Roosevelt Field on Long Island, Simon's focus these days is on outlet malls. It competes there with Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (NYSE:SKT). Both stocks have been losers for years as the e-commerce boom rolls on.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhere is the hope in buying companies like this? It's in the real estate. RedevelopmentJust because yesterday's shopping mall of department-store anchors, small shops on air-conditioned walks and acres of surrounding parking is dying, the land isn't necessarily worthless.Simon Property Group has 20 projects underway right now, aimed at transforming its malls into destinations with hotels, or sporting venues with poker and e-sports.The REIT is in a good position to be a developer because it has a low ratio of debt to equity and can easily cover its debt payments. It has $7 billion in liquidity and $1.5 billion in retained cash flow. It has the cash to buy out more troubled rivals and to rebuild its own holdings. Its budget for such work now comes to over $1 billion per year.  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade From a technical perspective, the stock is a bargain right now. As InvestorPlace's Vince Martin notes, the shares are at a five-year low. The $32 billion in assets are highly tangible, many of them desirable suburban locations. You have a balance sheet prepared for Armageddon with a yield better than AT&T (NYSE:T).What else would an income investor need? The Bear CaseThere is a bear case to be made on Simon.It starts with the stock price, which is down 20% over the last five years. Dividend returns are barely keeping up with the deterioration. Long-term technical indicators say &quot;sell it.&quot;Then there's management. Its big move this century has been to expand into outlet malls. Tanger, which is more heavily into outlet malls than Simon, has lost more than half its value over the last five years. The strategy of moving into outlets looks unsound. The real estate is less valuable, and the merchandise is all moving online.There may be more questionable decisions on the way. CEO David Simon told his July conference call the company is looking to buy out some tenants, the chain stores closing in retailing's Armageddon. That worked three years ago with Aeropostale. If Simon is going to become a retailer, and not a mall operator, that means it's a riskier play. This adds to the bear case. The Bottom Line on Simon Property GroupSimon Property Group is distressed merchandise, but it will pay you to own it.At its Dec. 12 opening price of $145.58, it's selling at trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 19.4, despite having one of the best dividends around.If you're the kind of investor who likes to buy when everyone around you is screaming &quot;sell,&quot; then hold for up to 5 years on hopes of an uptick, Simon Property Group is your kind of deal. It's a good speculation for an income investor with a long-term view. That's why many stock sites are now filled with punters screaming &quot;buy, buy, buy.&quot;They might be right.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-10-30	2019-10-30 21:41:54	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Via Transportation CEO Ramot Sees Big Money in Buses: STYT	(Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg News is hosting the Sooner Than You Think conference in New York, exploring what’s next in technology, Wednesday at The Weylin in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Speakers are discussing topics such as how companies can restore trust in the tech sector; how new frontiers like AI create new obligations for business and governments; the best ways to protect your data in the age of cybersecurity attacks; the antitrust probes of Big Tech and more.Watch LIVE. All times are local New York.Via Sees Big Money in Buses (5:45 p.m.)Daniel Ramot, chief executive officer of ride-sharing company Via Transportation, Inc., sees big money in buses.New York-based Via is often characterized as a smaller competitor to Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. But Ramot sees those companies as disrupting the cab and limo market, while Via is focused on public transportation. In fact, 95% of Via rides are shared, he said. Via also sells software to public transportation systems to improve efficiency, with nearly 100 partners worldwide.Ramot puts the public mobility market -- which includes city buses, school buses, university shuttles and similar types of transportation -- at a half-trillion-dollar industry, which he sees as a big opportunity, larger than the taxi and ride-hailing space.And environmental concerns will boost demand for these options.“There’s always going to be private cars, people riding around by themselves,” he said. “But my hope is that increasingly we will look at people riding around by themselves in a car a little bit the way we might think about someone walking into a kindergarten and smoking.”Compass Says It’s Not Like WeWork (5:23 p.m.)The chief executive officer of SoftBank-backed real estate brokerage Compass said his company had already moved away from a strategy of rapid growth before WeWork’s scuttled initial public offering.Compass has raised $1.5 billion in venture capital, and like WeWork, it tapped SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund. Skeptics in the real estate industry say the brokerage lacks a disruptive technology or business model, and has relied on deep coffers of venture funding to buy growth.But Compass had stopped expanding into new geographic areas by the beginning of this year, CEO Robert Reffkin said. The company is already profitable in many markets and is under no pressure to go public, he added.Reffkin enumerated other advantages. He said the company’s strategy of treating real estate agents as its primary customers would help recruiting efforts in the event of a recession. And unlike video-streaming sites or car-hailing services, Compass hasn’t attracted imitators.“Seven years in, there hasn’t been one copycat,” he said.California Privacy Law Does More Harm Than Good, Industry Executives Say (4:00 p.m.)California’s data privacy law does more harm than good for consumer privacy, said Michael Beckerman, president and chief executive officer of the Internet Association, and Mignon Clyburn, former commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission.The first data privacy law in the country takes effect Jan. 1, 2020, but the representative from the industry group that represents big technology and the former federal official argued the California Consumer Privacy Act needs to be replaced with a federal law. They worry that other states will follow California’s lead and pass their own regulations, creating a possible patchwork of varying standards across the country.Companies will struggle to comply with multiple laws, Beckerman said.“They got so much wrong, and what they did do will make people less private,” he said. “It makes no sense that one state can set the rules, leaving the rest of the country to pivot.”Clyburn agreed, but said a federal law to pre-empt state regulations is unlikely until after the 2020 presidential election.Former DHS Adviser Says Trump Ukraine Server Allegation ‘Completely Debunked’ (3:30 p.m.)Tom Bossert, a former Homeland Security adviser to President Donald Trump, called the “conspiracy theory” that Trump has pursued, in which there is a Democratic National Committee server in Ukraine, has been “completely debunked.”Bossert said he expects more countries to get involved in attempting to influence the next U.S presidential election. “Buckle up, because it’s about to get started in a bigger and larger scale, in my view,” said Bossert, who now works as the chief strategy officer at Trinity Cyber. “The trend that we will see when we look back on this 2020 election is the entrance of China, Iran, North Korea, maybe 10 or 12 nation-state actors that are highly sophisticated.”Brittany Kaiser, co-founder of the Digital Asset Trade Association, said she’s not sure “that we’ve really learned enough about all of the problems from 2016. Facebook’s policy of allowing political campaigns to lie in campaign ads could allow them to conduct voter suppression, she said. “We don’t actually have oversight over what these campaigns are saying.”Yasmin Green, director of research and development at Jigsaw, warned that those looking to influence elections have become more skilled. “Defenses are better and the threat is more sophisticated,” Green said. “So looking to 2020 the question mark for me is, are we going to say domestic disinformation doesn’t really feel like on par with state sponsored, cross border election meddling.”Simon Ventures Head Says WeWork Shows ‘Inconsistent’ Valuations (3:30pm)WeWork, the work-sharing real-estate startup, created a “ highly dsyfunctional” capital structure as it moved toward an initial public offering, said Natalie Hwang, managing director and head of Simon Ventures, the venture capital arm of Simon Property Group, Inc., the largest shopping mall and retail center owner in the U.S. Simon Ventures passed on the opportunity to invest in WeWork a few years ago. “In the case of WeWork, the public markets ultimately disagreed with private company valuations and I would expect for companies to be valued at increasingly inconsistent fashion.”WeWork was valued at as much as $47 billion before its IPO collapsed and the company’s value fell to an estimated $8 billion in a bailout plan. Jason Illian, managing Director of Koch Disruptive Technologies, the venture and growth arm of Koch Industries, Inc. said WeWork won’t be the last example of a private company’s valuation being overhyped.Foursquare Chief Says GDPR Needs to Better Protect Location Data (2:30 p.m.)Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation doesn’t go far enough to protect consumers from abuse of their location data, Foursquare Labs Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Glueck said.Glueck said regulators should enact laws to protect consumers’ location data, and make sure they consent to what they share. Glueck said his company supports the European privacy law, but it needs to go further, and the U.S. needs a national privacy law as well.“There is no rule today about how to use location data or what is informed consent,” he said. “Consumers should not be judged to have consented to anything because of a 200-page ‘Terms and Conditions.’”Glueck, in effect, is calling for regulation on his own company. Foursquare, which began as a social-media app letting a user broadcast their location to friends, now builds location-data systems for other companies including Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc.Companies should be legally responsible to use consumer’s real-time location data in the user’s best interest, similar to an accountant’s fiduciary duty. Regulations should ensure “competition can continue but with a high ethical bar,” he said.Google Rival DuckDuckGo Makes ‘Ton of Money’ From Private Search Engine (1 p.m.)DuckDuckGo, a privacy-focused search engine provider, makes “a ton of money” without resorting to the personalized, targeted advertising that Google uses, according to Megan Gray, the company’s top lawyer and policy chief.There are many reasons for transferring personal information between companies, but with online search it doesn’t need to be that way, Gray said during a discussion about privacy-focused product design. After you search for a little black dress and then lipstick, companies don’t need to follow you around the web with similar ads, she added.“That’s only what you see. There’s a lot more behind the curtain in terms of how you are being categorized by the searches you have done,” Gray said.Gray and other speakers called for an enforceable “Do Not Track” law in the U.S. that would help people easily prevent technology and digital-advertising companies from collecting personal data and following users around the web.Smartphone settings could have a simple “don’t track me” setting, Gray explained. There are technical ways to do some of this already, but an enforcement mechanism is needed, she said.The idea that a Do Not Track law would destroy the online ad industry is “a bit of a bluff,” said Elizabeth Zalman, chief executive officer of strongDM, which makes software for securely managing databases and computer servers.Andrew Farah, CEO of startup Density, said everyone would have to activate such a Do Not Track setting for the digital ad business to be really damaged.The panel ended with a question about Silicon Valley and whether there are the right incentives in place for entrepreneurs to think about privacy and do the right thing when they’re starting companies.“Do you want me to get to raise my next round of funding?” Zalman said, prompting laughter from the crowd. Leaders of tech startups should treat data records as real humans and lock down that information, she added. “I don’t know if it’s necessarily baked into the venture capital route.”WeWork’s Failed IPO Was a Case of Corporate Greed, Former Snap Exec Khan Says (12:45p.m.)WeWork’s aborted initial public offering is a case of “corporate greed,” said Imran Khan, co-founder and chief executive officer of e-commerce company Verishop. Khan was previously involved in high-profile public offerings, as chief strategy officer at Snap Inc. and as a managing director at Credit Suisse Group AG, where he helped internet companies, including Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, list on the stock market.Khan said that whenever an investor gives someone money, they are giving trust, and the recipient has a responsibility to live by that trust.“At WeWork we saw the gross negligence of this trust,” Khan said. It was a degree of irresponsibility he hadn’t seen since 1999 or 2000, he added.We Co. was valued at $47 billion at its peak earlier this year, but that dropped to only about $8 billion as part of the aborted IPO and bail-out plan.Generally, Khan said that while the private market in many cases results in inflated valuations, he can see why investors like it. “You don’t have to worry about day to day volatility,” he said.“If you want to build a business for the long term, to be honest with you it’s difficult to do that in the public market these days,” Khan said. “I think it’s getting more and more challenging.”Earlier this year, Khan launched Verishop, which sells lifestyle products which sells a curated offering ranging from clothing to sustainable household items and non-toxic toys.Ohio AG Wonders if Current Antitrust Law is Sufficient For Big Tech (12:30 p.m.)Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost questioned whether existing antitrust law is sufficient to police Big Tech. “What is the right way to regulate or limit, or separate the power that is being gathered?” Yost said. “I’m not entirely sure that the antitrust jurisprudence we have is adequate.”Yost described three historic phases of power accumulation: First governments, which were split up into separate branches; then, old economic monopolies, which the federal government broke up; and now, large technology platforms. “Today there’s this third wave of power,” he said. “Power is always antithetical to individual freedom.”Yost said he is still trying to frame questions about how to restrain that power. He didn’t offer pointed solutions.Two groups of state attorneys general are investigating Facebook Inc. and Google for abuses of power. Those cases are in their early stages. The attorneys general haven’t publicly articulated a clear legal case against these tech giants and Yost did not offer one Wednesday.Instead, he asked whether the existing laws were sufficient to deal with the tech giants’ newfound power. “The piece that is proceeding under traditional antitrust principles is probably distinguished by fact patterns and business models of each case. The overall debate question that I’m posing is, is this really about the aggregation of power?” he said. “There’s been tremendous change driven by these big tech platforms -- there’s almost nothing that hasn’t been touched in our lives and impacted, in many, many ways for the better.”Yost indicated that he was taking a measured approach. “I’m not with the pitchfork and torch crowd, OK?. But we do need to think about the potential outcomes here, and are there things that we want guardrails from?”Kerry Washington Talks About Changing the Narrative in Hollywood (12:00 p.m.)Kerry Washington is best known as Olivia Pope, the star of the ABC drama “Scandal.” But now she is starring in a new film called “American Son” on Netflix, and is hoping its message starts a conversation. In the film, which debuts Friday, she looks for her missing son at a police precinct. It’s a timely show in light of several police killings of black Americans. “Whether you’re a man or woman, black or white, it makes you think,” she said. “People who wouldn’t normally watch this are watching this and learning something.”Washington shared the stage with Pilar Savone, who produced “Django Unchained” and heads development for Washington’s production company, Simpson Street. Savone said the film was originally a play. Now that it’s on Netflix, it can reach a much larger audience.“It’s such an important story for people to see and not everyone has access to Broadway,” Savone said.Both women said Hollywood is starting to think more about hiring women and minorities -- in front of the camera and behind it. When Simpson Street shoots a pilot, “we want to make sure our candidate pool is diverse,” Washington said.Washington has also invested in The Wing, a woman-focused co-working space. She described the startup as “a sisterhood” where women are “having a lot of conversations on a lot of levels.” She also gave out her phone number, saying it would help her fans connect with her on Community.com, a communications startup. Community, she said, “allows me to engage more with fans on one-to-one basis” and “have a real conversation.”Washington said she was going to knock on doors this weekend in Michigan and Virginia to encourage people to register to vote. Asked who she’s backing in the presidential race, she demurred. “My candidate is the American people,” she said.Shopify CEO Lutke Says He’s Helping Others Compete With Amazon (11:19 a.m.)Shopify Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tobi Lutke said the Canadian e-commerce company isn’t competing with Amazon.com Inc., but helping other people do so. “Amazon wants to be an empire,” he said. “At Shopify, we are arming the rebels.” Lutke said he didn’t think the economy would be healthy if there were five mega-corporations employing everyone, and that the world needs millions of businesses to employ millions of people.Shopify recently announced it had reached 1 million merchants using its platform around the world.The Ottawa-based company is spending $1 billion dollars to set up a network of fulfillment centers in the U.S. to help merchants using its platforms deliver products. The company processes millions of individual sales by hundreds of thousands of merchants each year, and could potentially pool shipments from different online stores together. “If you put a lot of lights together you end up with a sun,” said Lutke.“What will that do for margins? Well, it’s going to be expensive,” Lutke said of the 10-figure investment. He added that Shopify is “a growth investment.”Shopify is one of Canada’s best performing stocks, having gained about 130% this year as investors reward the company’s fast growing sales. But the company reported an unexpected quarterly loss earlier this week due to higher spending as it expands its customer network and building out the fulfillment centers.Two Sigma’s David Siegel Talks About the New Rules For Tech (10:40 a.m.)David Siegel, co-founder of the Two Sigma Investments hedge fund, said if giant tech companies began self-regulation as concerns over privacy mount it might prevent the government from enacting more severe controls.“The industry participants themselves understand what’s possible and what isn’t possible better than maybe a government agency would,” Siegel said. “If the industry could get together and work collaboratively to set rules of the road, then maybe we will all be happier.”Siegel, who has been outspoken about the benefits and dangers associated with artificial intelligence, said industries like finance and medicine had very little oversight in their early days, and that didn’t lead to good outcomes. He finds it hard to understand why tech leaders would think that their industry would work perfectly without regulations.“I think having regulation in finance is a good thing,” Siegel said. “So I’ve never seen regulation as being a particularly big deal.”Siegel pointed out the trade-offs that come with regulations. Some people want privacy, but if the control of personal data is absolute, that might lead to unintended consequences, like making it harder for authorities to solve criminal activity.“So we might be willing to have a great level of abuse in our society, maybe it would lead to more violence, maybe it will lead to more financial fraud but maybe you’re all ok with that trade-off because you value privacy so much,” he said. “Or maybe you’re not.”New York-based Two Sigma, a quantitative hedge fund firm that deploys machine learning in its strategies, had $60 billion in assets in August.One of Tech’s Biggest Critics Takes on The Role of Technology in Society (9:45 a.m.)Tristan Harris is a former Google employee who has turned into one of the highest-profile critics of Big Tech. His job at Alphabet Inc.’s Google was to make sure ethics were taken into account when new products were designed, but he left years ago to try and push that mission from the outside. Harris, who is the co-founder and executive director at the Center for Humane Technology, says human minds are no match for the sophisticated attention-grabbing algorithms built by Facebook Inc., YouTube and Twitter Inc. and that these companies’ entire business models need to change. “We’re all trapped inside this system,” Harris said.As long as the goal of these companies is to maximize our time spent on their platforms so they can sell more ads, misinformation, outrage and conspiracy theories will continue to proliferate, simply because they’re more engaging than the truth in many cases, he said.The recent trend of employees at these companies banding together to try and force changes from within is the fastest way to get these companies to alter their practices, he said. Recent examples of this from Google and Facebook give him hope.(Updates with comments from Compass CEO)&#92;--With assistance from Gerrit De Vynck, Vincent Bielski, Eric Newcomer, Gerry Smith, Candy Cheng, Alistair Barr and Kartikay Mehrotra.To contact the reporters on this story: Patrick Clark in New York at pclark55@bloomberg.net;Kiley Roache in New York at kroache@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly Schuetz, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ohio-ag-wonders-antitrust-law-162752102.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-30	2019-09-30 20:46:45	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Forever 21 Goes Bust Adding More Stores to Retail Apocalypse	(Bloomberg) -- Forever 21 Inc. filed for bankruptcy, joining the growing list of fashion retailers felled by heavy competition, high rents and the defection of shoppers to online outlets.Plans include cutting at least 178 domestic outlets from Forever 21’s approximately 800 stores, after a disastrous expansion outside the U.S. The Chapter 11 court filing on Sunday allows Forever 21 to keep operating while it works out a strategy to pay its creditors and turn the business around.All told, the retailer employs about 6,400 full-time and 26,400 part-time workers, court papers show. Forever 21 said it expects to exit most of its outlets in Asia and Europe, and it will shut all of its 44 Canadian stores that provide about 2,000 jobs, according to company statements.Forever 21 suffered from the same cutthroat pricing and online competition that has forced other U.S. retailers to close thousands of stores in the past two years. But its problems were deepened by inventory miscalculations--underspending one year, then overspending the next -- and a botched international venture, according to court papers.The rapid global expansion left the company stuck with locations that were too expensive and too big, court papers show. Despite having 262 stores by 2015 outside the U.S., it couldn’t achieve economies of scale because of geographical differences in taste and climate.International LossesThe result: Forever 21 is losing $10 million a month in Canada, Europe and Asia. Stateside sales are relatively strong, according to court papers filed in Wilmington, Delaware.In addition to shuttering 178 U.S. stores, the company plans to close all 44 of its Canadian outlets and 14 in Japan. It's also “exiting much of Europe and Asia,” according to a media representative.The filing cited 11 leases it wants to cancel for stores that haven’t opened yet, including two for Forever 21 and nine new stores for its beauty and wellness brand, Riley Rose. Giving up new Riley Rose shops dramatically cuts back on the company’s plans to expand the brand, which currently operates just 15 outlets.The company asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross to set rules for canceling leases that would apply to stores it decides to liquidate.Yesterday’s TrendOnce popular among teenagers in the 2000s for its affordable but eye-catching designs, Forever 21’s signature bright-yellow shopping bags have become a rarer sight as Generation Z consumers -- those born from 1998 onwards -- shifted rapidly to e-commerce and streetwear brands.The bankruptcy filing could help Forever 21 get rid of unprofitable stores and raise fresh funds, allowing the private, family-held company to restructure its flailing business for a new generation. In the meantime, the stores expect to honor gift cards, returns and exchanges.Forever 21 has obtained $275 million of debtor-in-possession financing from lenders with JPMorgan Chase & Co. as agent, as well as $75 million in new capital from TPG Sixth Street Partners and its affiliated funds.“The key to successfully effectuating this restructuring is speed and cooperation,” the company said in court papers. “Forever 21’s DIP facilities are highly conditioned on moving quickly through these cases with support from all major stakeholders, including lenders, trade vendors, and landlords.”Bankrupt retailers face more time pressure than other companies in Chapter 11 because the law requires them to decide within 120 days which leases they will keep and which they will reject. Forever 21 said it plans to ask Gross for more time to make that decision.Landlord NegotiationsThe bankruptcy filing followed months of discussions with stakeholders over how to salvage the business. Chief among those parties are the retailer’s biggest landlords, including mall owners Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners LP.Forever 21 held talks with Simon and Brookfield over a pre-bankruptcy deal that would have handed them a stake in the company in exchange for considerations that could have included rent forgiveness, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month. Those talks, however, broke down, and by last week the company prepared for court proceedings without a deal in hand.The retailer is negotiating with its largest landlords to “right size” its store footprint, the company’s chief restructuring officer, Jonathan Goulding of Alvarez & Marsal, said in a court declaration. While the parties have swapped proposals, he said, they haven’t reached a deal. Just four landlords hold almost 50% of the company’s leases, he said.Forever 21 said it owes various lenders at least $227.7 million, including $194.5 million in asset-backed loans, a $20 million term loan and unsecured debt of 950 million Philippine pesos ($18.3 million) owed to a company organized in the Philippines named Praxton Commercial Corp. Bloomberg first reported Aug. 28 that Forever 21 was preparing for a bankruptcy filing.“In an age when retail, as most Americans know it, is under assault, Forever 21 intends to use these proceedings to remain viable and write a different ending from so many retail companies before it,” Goulding said. “The goal of these Chapter 11 cases is clear: emerge with a viable and feasible standalone business and keep the dream alive.”Mall WoesForever 21’s bankruptcy filing could be problematic for major U.S. mall owners, including Simon and Brookfield because it is one of the biggest mall tenants still standing after a wave of bankruptcies. The busts emptied more than 12,000 stores in the past two years, and those vacancies may be hard to fill.Simon counts Forever 21 as its sixth-largest tenant excluding department stores, with 99 outlets covering 1.5 million square feet as of March 31, according to a filing.Simon and Brookfield were both listed in court papers on Forever 21’s tally of biggest unsecured creditors. The retailer doesn’t have a lot of leverage over its landlords, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, which said in a Sept. 27 report that Forever 21 accounts for just 1.4% of Simon’s annual rent.Forever 21 specializes in fast-fashion apparel-- trendy, cheap, quickly-made knockoffs of original designs that often is worn only a few times before being given away or tossed out. Competitors include Zara, H&M and Amazon.com.Jin Sook and Do Won Chang started Forever 21, first called Fashion 21, in 1984 after emigrating from South Korea. Chang worked as a janitor, gas station attendant and cafe employee while Sook worked as a hairdresser, and the couple saved $11,000 over three years to start the retailer, Goulding said.The first store, a 900-square-foot space in Highland Park, sold $700,000 of merchandise during its first year, court papers show. Forever 21 grew rapidly and employed 43,000 at its peak, boasting more than $4 billion in annual sales.Co-founder Chang has been focused on maintaining a controlling stake in Forever 21, which hindered efforts to raise new funds. Matters are likely to be out of his hands now, with creditors typically setting the agenda in bankruptcy proceedings and major decisions subject to a judge’s approval.The case is Forever 21 Inc., 19-12122, District of Delaware (Delaware)(Updates with additional store closures in the seventh paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Rick Green, Boris Korby, David Scheer, Rachel Chang, Jeremy Hill, Steven Church and Adam Cataldo.To contact the reporters on this story: Eliza Ronalds-Hannon in New York at eronaldshann@bloomberg.net;Lauren Coleman-Lochner in New York at llochner@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Dawn McCartyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forever-21-files-bankruptcy-adding-025335250.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-27	2019-09-27 15:59:57	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Forever 21 at an Impasse on Landlord Deal Ahead of Bankruptcy	(Bloomberg) -- Struggling teen retailer Forever 21 Inc. has reached an impasse in talks over a restructuring deal that would give its two largest landlords a stake in the company, according to people with knowledge of the situation.The breakdown in negotiations with Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners LP means the retailer is without a reorganization plan as it prepares for a bankruptcy filing, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing private negotiations. Going to court without a plan could delay and complicate the company’s turnaround efforts.Forever 21, with about 600 U.S. stores, would be one of the largest retail bankruptcies yet in a year rife with them, and could leave landlords with millions of additional square feet of vacant space. U.S. retailers have closed 8,567 stores in 2019, according to a Sept. 27 report from Coresight Research, more than all of last year. While the parties initially discussed closing at least 100 Forever 21 locations, that number could now be higher, the people said.Representatives for Forever 21 and Simon didn’t respond to requests seeking comment, while Brookfield declined to comment.Forever 21 was aiming to file for bankruptcy with an agreement in place to give its landlords a stake in the company while allowing co-founder Do Won Chang to retain a share, Bloomberg earlier reported. Negotiations with the mall operators have included questions over ownership and leadership of the company during and after its restructuring, as well as which stores to shutter.The talks among Forever 21, lenders and its landlords are evolving rapidly, and the outcome may still change, the people said.The Los Angeles-based retailer is now headed into the biggest sales period of the year, when it’s essential to have well-stocked shelves and adequate staffing. Lenders watch holiday performance keenly, and a difficult season could weaken support from creditors and vendors.&#92;--With assistance from Natalie Wong.To contact the reporters on this story: Lauren Coleman-Lochner in New York at llochner@bloomberg.net;Eliza Ronalds-Hannon in New York at eronaldshann@bloomberg.net;Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Boris Korby, Shannon D.

2019-09-20	2019-09-20 11:00:18	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	For Clothing Retailers, Breaking Up Is Now Harder to Do	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Two big names in clothing retail are getting smaller. Gap Inc. laid out the details last week of its previously announced plan to split into two companies — one that is solely its Old Navy chain, and another for everything else. Meanwhile, J. Crew Group Inc. made it official last week that it plans to spin off its Madewell chain.Both of these splits are the right moves for two apparel businesses that have oddly similar problems: Their newer chains are doing well, but their older ones are struggling.(1) The breakups will allow executives to focus more intently on the troubled brands’ problems.But the plans are still risky, on their own terms and because of larger complications introduced by President Donald Trump’s trade war. The last month or so has amped up enormous tariff-related uncertainty for the apparel industry, as Trump moved to slap levies on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, only to soon delay some of them. Clothing retailers tend to say they will deal with this situation by negotiating with suppliers. Scale is a huge asset in such negotiations, with the biggest companies having the most leverage. Once the Gap and J. Crew empires split, they will have less muscle to flex in these discussions.A similar dynamic exists with their relationships to their mall landlords. Consider the latest in the saga of another mall heavyweight, Forever 21. My colleagues at Bloomberg News reported this week that the company is holding discussions with Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners LP about the mall operators buying a stake in the clothing chain as part of a potential bankruptcy filing. It would be similar to when landlords stepped in to save teen clothing chain Aeropostale; the landlords apparently decided owning a piece of an ailing retail chain was preferable to being stuck with a raft of vacancies.Several retail giants have filed for bankruptcy since that 2016 Aeropostale deal without mall operators intervening. But Forever 21 might be different, in part because of its scale: With more than 800 stores, landlords may believe that it is, to steal a popular phrase from another industry, too big to fail. A question for Gap and J. Crew is whether their splits leave them too small to matter.Of course, some of J. Crew and Gap’s peers are also slimming down, meaning they might be dealing with similar hurdles. Ascena Retail Group Inc. has sold its Maurice’s chain and is shuttering Dressbarn;  Bloomberg News reported Thursday it is now considering unloading its Catherines and Lane Bryant brands. L Brands Inc. has closed its small Henri Bendel chain and sold La Senza – tiny parts of its business, to be sure. But it continues to face questions from investors about whether it should separate Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, a move that would greatly change its scale. Overall, the benefits of a sharper focus (and, in J. Crew’s case, the ability to use IPO proceeds to pay down some debt) will probably make these separations worthwhile. But even the best breakups are challenging — and the uncertain trade and mall retail environments are likely to make them even more so.(1) Old Navy's comparable sales have slipped in the two most recent quarters, but it has been the crown jewel of the company for years.To contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Newman at mnewman43@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

Forever 21 Is in Talks to Give Landlords a Stake in Bankruptcy	(Bloomberg) -- Forever 21 Inc. is in discussions to give a stake in the company to its two largest landlords as part of a restructuring that would allow co-founder Do Won Chang to retain a share, according to people familiar with the matter.The ailing fast-fashion retailer is in talks with Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners LP about the proposal, which would be part of a bankruptcy filing, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing a private matter. The negotiations are ongoing, and could end without a deal, they said.Los Angeles-based Forever 21 is preparing to file for bankruptcy as soon as this month, ideally with a restructuring plan in place, the people said. Company advisers have been working on obtaining a bankruptcy loan package that would give the retailer about $75 million to continue operations during the case, Bloomberg previously reported.A spokeswoman for Brookfield declined to comment on its involvement in a potential deal, and Simon and Forever 21 didn’t respond to requests for comment.Aeropostale DealThe trendy retailer’s fate has become increasingly important to mall owners, who’ve seen former stalwarts including Payless Inc. and Gymboree Corp. shutter more than 8,500 stores this year, according to firm Coresight Research Inc. That’s left Forever 21 as one of the largest remaining occupants, with more than 800 stores globally.At the same time, the retailer is dependent on its landlords, which could play a crucial role as it looks to slim down operations and revive its best locations. The restructuring plan under discussion could include rent forgiveness or other considerations from the landlords in exchange for a stake in Forever 21, the people said.Simon and General Growth Properties Inc., now part of Brookfield, teamed up to buy most of bankrupt teen clothing chain Aeropostale three years ago. They’ve since sat on the sidelines as retailers liquidated, but Simon has publicly said it’s open to doing similar-type deals going forward.On a July 31 conference call with investors to discuss second-quarter earnings, Simon Property Group Chief Executive Officer David Simon said his company was well-positioned to invest in distressed tenants.“We certainly have the ability to help beyond what you might do on the leases and become an investor in a distressed situation,” Simon said. “So we have kind of the ability, together or individually or some combination thereof, to look at becoming more than just a real estate player, but a buyer of these brands.”&#92;--With assistance from Natalie Wong.To contact the reporters on this story: Lauren Coleman-Lochner in New York at llochner@bloomberg.net;Eliza Ronalds-Hannon in New York at eronaldshann@bloomberg.net;Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Nicole Bullock, Shannon D.

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 23:30:51	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Forever 21 Prepares for Potential Bankruptcy Filing	(Bloomberg) -- Forever 21 Inc. is preparing for a potential bankruptcy filing as the fashion retailer’s cash dwindles and turnaround options fade, according to people with knowledge of the plans.The company has been in talks for additional financing and working with a team of advisers to help it restructure its debt, but negotiations with possible lenders have so far stalled, the people said. Focus has thus shifted toward securing a potential debtor-in-possession loan to take the company into Chapter 11, they said, even as some window remains to strike a last-minute deal that keeps it out of court.Representatives for Forever 21 didn’t respond to a request for comment.A bankruptcy filing would help the company shed unprofitable stores and recapitalize the business, said the people, who requested anonymity discussing private negotiations. Yet it could also be problematic for the country’s major mall owners, including Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners LP. Forever 21 is one of the biggest mall tenants still standing after a wave of bankruptcies in the retail sector.Empty SpacesIf the chain were to close a significant number of stores as part of the restructuring, its landlords could have trouble filling the vacancies. Indianapolis-based Simon counts Forever 21 as its sixth-largest tenant excluding department stores, with 99 outlets covering 1.5 million square feet, according to a filing as of March 31.Co-founder Do Won Chang has been focused on maintaining a controlling stake in Forever 21, which has limited its fundraising options.A faction of company officials, without the approval of Chang, had asked its biggest landlords to consider taking a stake in the retailer amid a disagreement within its leadership, Bloomberg previously reported.Founded in 1984, Forever 21 operates more than 800 stores in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America.(Adds potential impact of a bankruptcy on mall owners beginning in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Boris Korby and David Scheer.To contact the reporters on this story: Eliza Ronalds-Hannon in New York at eronaldshann@bloomberg.net;Lauren Coleman-Lochner in New York at llochner@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Dawn McCarty, Rizal TupazFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forever-21-prepares-potential-bankruptcy-201802375.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-07	2019-08-07 12:30:01	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Mall Landlords Weigh Becoming Lenders to Blunt Retail Apocalypse	(Bloomberg) -- Mall landlords accustomed to offering rent reductions to ailing retailers are mulling a new strategy to forestall the industry’s collapse: positioning themselves as lenders to tenants struggling to stay afloat.Boutique bank PJ Solomon has organized discussions with several mall owners about pursuing such a strategy with troubled retailer Forever 21 Inc., according to people with knowledge of the matter, in what could serve as a model for future transactions within the sector.The talks have centered on converting rent and other liabilities into secured debt that could give distressed companies some breathing room to stay out of court, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. If a retailer later goes bust, the arrangement could give landlords a stronger say in the restructuring process because lenders get higher priority in a bankruptcy, they said. The landlords potentially could use their preferred status to bid for assets, swapping their unpaid claims for ownership.For mall operators dealing with wave after wave of closings, the situation is critical. More than 7,500 U.S. retail storefronts have shuttered this year alone, according to Coresight Research, dwarfing openings as chains such as Payless Inc. and Gymboree Corp. ceased operations. Landlords are faced with either slashing rents or dealing with empty properties that don’t have ready occupants. Less than half of U.S. malls are likely to survive the industry’s disruption, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lindsay Dutch.Breathing RoomMall owners have been willing to consider a wider range of options, including outright purchases of bankrupt tenants, to help keep stores from going dark. That’s been done only once before in recent history. Three years ago, America’s two largest mall operators -- Simon Property Group Inc. and General Growth Properties Inc. -- were part of a group that bought Aeropostale Inc., preserving more than 200 of the clothing chain’s stores.“Unless the landlords are going to repurpose their properties altogether, they still have to capture the greatest value they can from retail tenants,” said Scott Stuart, chief executive officer of industry group Turnaround Management Association, who has worked on corporate restructurings for 30 years. “If they can get creative about keeping the stores open, it may be a win-win situation.”PJ Solomon and Brookfield Property Partners LP -- which purchased General Growth Properties last year -- declined to comment, while representatives for Simon Property Group and Forever 21 didn’t respond to requests seeking comment.On a July 31 conference call with investors to discuss second-quarter earnings, Simon Property Group Chief Executive Officer David Simon acknowledged the company has considered pursuing more investments like the one in Aeropostale.“We certainly have the ability to help beyond what you might do on the leases and become an investor in a distressed situation,” Simon said. “So we have kind of the ability, together or individually or some combination thereof, to look at becoming more than just a real estate player, but a buyer of these brands.”Their diverse portfolio of tenants gives REITs particular insight into which merchants could make successful investments, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Dutch.“They will be selective when they make an investment,” Dutch said. “They won’t just go after every failing retailer.”&#92;--With assistance from Lily Katz, Gillian Tan and Scott Deveau.To contact the reporters on this story: Lauren Coleman-Lochner in New York at llochner@bloomberg.net;Eliza Ronalds-Hannon in New York at eronaldshann@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Boris KorbyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mall-landlords-weigh-becoming-lenders-123001129.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-08-06	2019-08-06 19:10:36	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Barneys Files for Bankruptcy As Rents Rise and Visitors Fall	(Bloomberg) -- Barneys New York Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors and laid out plans to shutter most of its stores after getting squeezed by rising rents and fewer visitors to its luxury fashion stores.The Chapter 11 filing in New York allows the department-store chain to stay open while it seeks to sell a slimmed-down business and to negotiate with its landlords.The company, owned by billionaire investor Richard Perry, said it has secured $75 million from affiliates of Hilco Global and Gordon Brothers Group to help meet its financial commitments. Authentic Brands Group LLC is one party in discussions with the retailer to potentially purchase assets including the company’s name brand and trademarks.“Like many in our industry, Barneys New York’s financial position has been dramatically impacted by the challenging retail environment and rent structures that are excessively high relative to market demand,” Chief Executive Officer Daniella Vitale said in a statement Tuesday.Barneys’ proposed bankruptcy loan would allow it to repay $50 million of debt and provide $25 million to help facilitate a sale in the next 60 days, court papers show. Before Barneys arranged that financing, one existing lender -- TPG Specialty Lending Inc. -- proposed $10 million of new money financing that would have required going-out-of-business sales at all but two Barneys stores, other court papers show.What’s ClosingThe bankruptcy had been telegraphed for several weeks as the retailer sought to avert Chapter 11 by finding a partner or buyer. Barneys said its stores on Madison Avenue and downtown New York City will remain open, as well as locations in Beverly Hills, San Francisco and Boston.The company currently employs 2,300 people, according to court papers.Two Barneys Warehouse locations will also stay open, and online operations will continue to operate. Among locations slated for closure include stores in Chicago, Las Vegas and Seattle, in addition to five smaller concept stores and seven Barneys Warehouse locations.“Aside from the high price tags on goods, this department store faces the same challenges as any department store,” George Angelich, partner at restructuring law firm Arent Fox, said in an interview before the filing. As rents increase and consumers shift to buying online, “it becomes very challenging to maintain profitability,” said Angelich, who isn’t involved in the case.Prior BustFounded as a men’s retailer in 1923 in Manhattan, Barneys morphed into a high fashion icon for women and men by the 1970s. It went bankrupt once before in 1996, after a falling out with a Japanese partner.Earlier this year, Barneys sought to downsize the Madison Avenue store to reduce the annual rent, which tripled this year, Bloomberg previously reported. The retailer was working on a restructuring plan with advisers at MIII Partners and Houlihan Lokey, and lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis.The chain listed $200 million of funded liabilities, with $800 million of revenue in 2018, according to papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Barneys also says it has about $120 million of federal net operating losses that could be used to offset future taxable income. Barneys is asking court permission to reject 15 store leases across the country, including deals with Brookfield Properties Inc. and Simon Property Group Inc. That could save the the company $2.2 million per month in rent and related expenses, Chief Restructuring Officer Moshin Y. Meghji said in a court declaration.Vendor UncertaintyThe prospect of liquidation sales at such a high-end store raised questions about how discounting could affect Barneys’ relationships with its vendors.“Barneys works with the crème de la crème of vendors, who don’t want their items hitting the market at discounted prices, and are probably not used to their merchants filing for bankruptcy,” said Stephen Selbst, chair of the restructuring and bankruptcy group at New York law firm Herrick, Feinstein LLP. “Their only possible recourse is to offer to buy back inventory to avoid it hitting the distribution channel, but that’s expensive. It’s going to be a walk into a very cold shower.”While maintaining good relationships with its vendors will be crucial to turning Barneys’ remaining business around, David Silverman, Senior Director in Fitch Ratings’ corporate group, wasn’t too concerned about the implications of discounting related to store closings.“It’s not like the company’s going to be putting yellow 40% off signs in the window,” Silverman said. “You can discount a good product by a little bit and drive a lot of excitement and traffic into the stores.”He added that, “customers are aware that these kind of markdown events are one time. This is an isolated incident.”The case is Barneys New York Inc., 19-36300-cgm, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Poughkeepsie).(Updates with potential buyer in third paragraph, bankruptcy loan uses in fifth paragraph and commentary on vendors in paragraphs 13 through 17)&#92;--With assistance from Jordyn Holman, Anne Riley Moffat, Eliza Ronalds-Hannon and Lauren Coleman-Lochner.To contact the reporters on this story: Katherine Doherty in New York at kdoherty23@bloomberg.net;Jeremy Hill in New York at jhill273@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Nicole Bullock, Dan WilchinsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/barneys-files-bankruptcy-rents-rise-052801789.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-16	2019-07-16 18:22:29	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	4 Retail Stocks to Buy in Time for the Back-to-School Rush	Over the next month or so, school starts up again across the United States. And for parents, that means a frenzied rush of back-to-school shopping.As investors, how can we cash in on the excitement?Obviously, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has done a number on many brick-and-mortar retailers. But others are figuring out ways to prosper despite the rapidly changing retail landscape.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Here are four retail stocks to buy as summer vacations wind down. Retail Stocks to Buy: Ross Stores (ROST)An overarching theme in the so-called retail apocalypse has been the collapse of department stores such as Sears and Bon-Ton. It has certainly been the end of an era for the traditional department-store led regional mall.But Amazon hasn't ended clothes shopping at brick-and-mortar locations; much of the traffic has moved to non-mall retailers.And no group of these has done better than the off-department store clothing chains. Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) is a perfect example of this category. Ross is set up in (generally) cheaper shopping center locations offering great branded products in no-frill stores at rock-bottom prices.Though Ross is a well-oiled supply chain and laser-focused on keeping overhead down, it can thrive in the new retail landscape. Its prices are competitive - if not better - than what you find online. Ross may not have the best consumer experience, but for people hunting for a bargain, it's the place to be.At 21.5x earnings, ROST stock isn't cheap, but it's not too expensive for a firm that is still growing rapidly. Additionally, ROST stock is just now approaching its high from last fall. Once it tops that, shares should break out technically to new highs. Macerich (MAC)If you like shopping at the mall, it's worth considering buying a mall REIT operator. Be careful in what you buy, however. Lower-end mall stocks have gotten pummeled as e-commerce has crushed many malls' fortunes.Analysts see the field dividing, however, with the strong malls getting stronger while weak malls fade and ultimately close or get redeveloped.Enter Macerich (NYSE:MAC). It is one of the strongest mall operators in the U.S. Its malls generate more than $700 per square foot of retail sales - that's 40% above the national average. If you live in a large metro area, there's a great chance that either Macerich or Simon Property (NYSE:SPG) owns the most luxurious mall or two near you.Why buy Macerich over the larger Simon? For one thing, Macerich's malls average even more sales per square foot than Simon. And like its sales, its dividend yield is bigger too - MAC stock pays a juicy 8.9% dividend now, compared to a more modest 5% from Simon.MAC stock has gotten cheap because it is relatively highly-levered. Investors fretted about whether it could maintain its dividend if a recession hit. But with the economy picking up and the Fed set to cut rates, Macerich should be fine on that front.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy Meanwhile, they've got several development projects in the works which should boost their cash flow - and ensure the dividend's safety - going forward. When you go to the mall, if you own MAC stock, you are, in a small way, helping pay yourself a dividend as you shop. Bloomin' Brands (BLMN)While you're out doing your back-to-school shopping, you may work up an appetite. That will lead you to my favorite sub-sector within retail: the restaurants. And thankfully, there's a tasty bargain on offer in this sector right now. That would be Bloomin' Brands (NASDAQ:BLMN). Bloomin' owns Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba's, and Bonefish Grill among its trademarks.BLMN stock fell from $22 earlier this year to just $17 now in large part due to analyst downgrades. These downgrades were based on fears about the impact of African Swine Fever. This disease has stricken tens of millions of pigs in China and other neighboring countries, causing the price of pork to spike. In theory, Bloomin' will have to pay more for meat, and thus its profits will drop - or so say the analysts.In practice, however, beef - not pork - is the main product Bloomin' sells, aside from its chain focused on fish. Sure, rising pork prices will be a minor negative, but there's no reason for BLMN stock to be down 25% when pork likely makes up just a couple percent (if that) of Bloomin's costs.One of the analysts that downgraded Bloomin' also cut their rating on Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) due to swine flu fears. Chipotle responded by saying that although it indeed sells a large amount of carnitas pork, the swine fever would have an inconsequential impact on its results. CMG stock bounced back up. Bloomin' will follow once investors figure out that the swine scare is no big deal for the company. Who goes to Outback to order a pork chop anyway? PriceSmart (PSMT)You may have noticed that Costco (NASDAQ:COST) has quietly been one of the top-performing retail stocks of the past decade. It's up eight-fold, in fact, since the early 2000s.For investors that missed Costco, there's good news - a copycat has taken the Costco model to Central and South America. It's called PriceSmart (NASDAQ:PSMT), and it operates in Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, and other such countries using the same membership and low-cost retail model.Until recently, investors took the &quot;Costco of Latin America&quot; label a little too seriously, and bid PriceSmart stock up to the stratosphere. It often traded above 30x earnings despite relatively slow earnings growth. A recent drop in emerging market sentiment, along with PriceSmart struggling to find good new store locations, has finally taken the stock back to a more reasonable valuation. Additionally, an earnings misssent PSMT stock down to near its 52-week lows.While PriceSmart is now priced attractively for being a standalone operation, it has also become an intriguing takeover target. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) - the largest retailer in Mexico and Central America - might take a look. It's a natural bolt-on given that Walmart already runs that type of store with its Sam's Club franchise. Falabella - Chile's dominant retailer - has been expanding northward and could use more presence in Colombia. And Exito, Colombia's leading grocery and hypermarket player, could be another potential PriceSmart buyer.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held no positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

La Monica informed his readers that these two retailers were the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks through the first six months of 2019. They were not the stocks to buy in the first half of the year. The article goes on to highlight other brick-and-mortar retailers that struggled in the first half of the year due to poor sales and profits. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHow have the retail ETFs done so far in 2019 compared to the S&P 500?Not well. While the broad market S&P 500 ETFs were up almost 20% in the first half of the year, the top retail ETFs by assets under management (AUM) have generated between half and one-quarter the returns. However, just because a group of stocks has under-performed in one period doesn't mean they will under-perform in another.   * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice For those who believe retail stocks will make a comeback in the second half, here are the seven stocks to buy that are down, but not out.   Simon Property Group (SPG)Source: m01229 via Flickr (Modified)As retail stocks go, Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is faring much better in 2019, although it's still down for the year. With retail stocks doing poorly, the focus falls on SPG and whether it can transform its malls into experiential palaces rather than moribund ghost towns where retailers go to die.However, as Greg Andrews of the Indianapolis Business Journal wrote about the mall owner recently, SPG &quot;racked up annualized total return of 14% a year, far better than the 9.6% posted by the S&P 500&quot; since going public in 1993. It's got staying power despite living through several market corrections as a publicly traded company. Plus, let's not forget that SPG stock has gone sideways the last five years while the index has gone on a tear. For me, the creme always rises to the top. CEO David Simon has been busy putting together a better mix of tenants that resonate with shoppers. Andrews highlighted the fact that Simon is making about 27% more from rent when it replaces an under-performing tenant with a newer, more appropriate one for today's changing retail climate. Despite the fact investors see brick-and-mortar retail doing poorly, Simon's evolution of its real estate ensures that the future is brighter than most people think.As Mark Twain said, &quot;Buy land. They're not making it any more.&quot; SPG is a long-term buy. Stocks to Buy: Kroger (KR)Source: Shutterstock It's been a mixed bag in 2019 for grocery store chains. Some are up while others, such as Kroger (NYSE:KR), the nation's largest publicly traded grocery store, are down.It seems investors continue to be worried about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and even Target (NYSE:TGT). They shouldn't be. Despite Jeff Bezos claiming all kinds of changes would happen under Amazon's leadership, little has changed at Whole Foods in the two years since Amazon acquired the high-end grocery store. In fact, if investors take a closer look at what Amazon has done with Whole Foods, they will realize that it's not the great emancipator everyone says it is. &quot;Food seems to be a category that keeps bedeviling Amazon. It said last week it will close its 4-year-old restaurant food delivery operation in the U.S., an admission that it had been outgunned by Grubhub, Doordash and Uber Eats,&quot; wrote Los Angeles Times contributors Sarah Halzack and Shira Ovide on June 16. &quot;It earlier pared back the footprint of its 12-year-old Amazon Fresh grocery-delivery service, which struggled long before Whole Foods was in its tent.&quot;The fact is, Kroger's transformation continues to deliver long-term benefits for the grocery store chain. These benefits include cost savings, real-time data analysis, alternative revenue streams, and higher online sales. In just five years, for example, it will have grown digital sales from nothing in 2014 to $5 billion in the coming year.   * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer In five more years, I'm confident that Kroger will be a different company from the one you see today. From where I sit, that's an excellent thing.  Kohl's (KSS)Source:  Hailey Pollard via FlickrThe second quarter was Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) worst quarter in the markets since 2001. You can now buy its stock for the same price you would have paid in November 2017. Yet, the retailer has more revenue and operating profits than it did two years ago. According to Miller Tabak equity strategist Matt Maley, the punishment dished out to KSS shareholders is overdone. &quot;Its weekly RSI chart is quite oversold and that one could be due for a bounce, one that could last more than a couple of days,&quot; Maley said June 28 on CNBC. Kohl's has been hit by weak sales so far in 2019. This has forced CEO Michelle Gass to lower its earnings per share guidance for the fiscal year from $5.98 (midpoint of estimate) to $5.30, an 11% cut to the bottom line. However, now that KSS has rolled out Amazon's return program nationwide and launched in-store initiatives, the outlook for the second half of the year is much brighter. The company has also become more adept at managing its inventory levels at lower-volume stores, helping it keep margins higher at locations that aren't performing to its standard. It's a big reason Kohl's is shuttering Off/Aisle stores, the company's off-price experiment. As I stated earlier this year, I recommended investors continue to watch how Kohl's partnership with Amazon progresses. Now that it has gone nationwide, I see Kohl's in-store revenues increasing as Amazon users return goods. The partnership has proven to be a winner. Soon, Kohl's stockholders will reap the benefits.  Urban Outfitters (URBN)Source: Shutterstock Business Insider often runs an article where a writer compares two different retail stores to gain a perspective as to why one stock is outperforming another. Recently, Shoshy Ciment shopped at both Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) and American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) stores in New York City.Ciment concluded that it was easy to see why American Eagle was dominating its segment of the retail sector. The Urban Outfitters store was in shambles while AEOs was a thing of beauty. While I get the Peter Lynch idea of seeing first hand how a business is operating, this exercise fails to consider several reasons why it might not be indicative of the entire picture. First, it's possible that the Urban Outfitters store was in the middle of changing its floor layout, which led to the less-than-desirable optics. Secondly, it's also possible that the URBN store was in-between managers. Retail has tremendous turnover, which often leads to terrible-looking stores while a team is understaffed. I could go on. The point is, you shouldn't surmise that one unsightly store is indicative of a poorly-performing stock or company. The opposite also holds. While it's true that AEO stock isn't doing nearly as poorly as URBN stock in 2019, they're both in the red year-to-date. Though AEO's Aerie line is killing it, shareholders should be concerned that it still can't deliver positive returns.That said, Urban Outfitters' three brands: Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, and Free People, have seen a slowdown of sales in recent quarters.  * The 7 Top Small-Cap Stocks Of 2019 However, from a value perspective, if you back out the company's $637 million in cash and marketable securities (it has no debt), you get an enterprise value of almost $1.7 billion. In the trailing 12 months ended April 30, Urban Outfitters had $290 million in free cash flow, for an FCF yield of about 17%, putting it easily within the value category.  Genesco (GCO) These last three retail stocks to buy all come with significant warts, so do your due diligence before purchasing any of them.The recent hiring of Mel Tucker as Genesco (NYSE:GCO) CFO suggests to me that good things are just around the corner for the Nashville company. Tucker's got extensive experience in the retail industry, most recently serving as CFO at the iconic New York City department store, Century 21. Genesco is transforming into a footwear retailer. In December, it sold off its Lids stores for just $100 million. The sale allows CGO to focus on shoes and generate some cash it could reinvest in its Journeys business, which produced 7% same-store sales in the first quarter ended May 4. That's on top of 6% same-store sales growth in the same quarter a year earlier. In the first quarter, Journeys generated about 65% of Genesco's overall revenue and a big chunk of its total operating profits. Overall, Geneco's adjusted EPS was $0.33, almost 136% higher than a year earlier. As a result, it expects to generate EPS of $3.55 in fiscal 2019. At a current price of $41, GCO stock is trading at less than 12 times those earnings. With net cash of $83 million and free cash flow of almost $157 million, GCO stock is worth a closer look.     Michaels (MIK)Source: Shutterstock The crafts retailer is your typical private equity horror story. Michaels (NASDAQ:MIK) was taken private in 2006 for $6 billion by Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) and Bain Capital (NYSE:BCSF). After weathering the financial crisis, it was finally ready to go public in 2012. Unfortunately, the CEO had a stroke and the IPO was postponed until June 2014 when it raised $473 million selling shares to the public at $17 apiece.Trading at less than half its IPO price, MIK stock continues to struggle with internal and external issues, the most recent being investor concerns about the company's debt. In May, Michaels refinanced $500 million of its 5.875% debt at 8%, a sign that investors are worried about how the U.S. tariffs will impact a company reliant on Chinese imports. Before Michaels was taken private, it had no debt and $452 million in cash on the balance sheet. After the takeover, Michaels had $3.7 billion in debt and just $30 million in cash.The private equity owners used its sound financial standing to get almost $4 billion in loans to pay for its acquisition. At the end of the quarter Michaels had $2.7 billion in debt, $246 million in cash, and $5.2 million in annualized revenues.Why do I think you should buy it?  * 7 Stocks to Buy for a Dovish Fed Someone will come along to take it private, slap a coat of paint on it, and take it public for a second time in less than a decade. Buckle (BKE)Buckle (NYSE:BKE) was a darn good stock and decent retailer to boot before it went into the toilet. Buckle now has a market cap of just $811 million, well below where it was trading at its height in 2015.However, despite having negative same-store sales for the past four years, BKE continues to make money, which is what ultimately drives stock prices higher. Back in 2015, Buckle was generating sales per square foot of $459. Today it's down to $334, or 37% lower. On the positive side, it has no debt, a working capital of $280 million, and has paid out $14.02 in regular and special dividends over the past five years. From a free cash flow perspective, Buckle's got $110 million for an FCF yield of 11.7%, also in value territory. If you're looking to capture a little income and aren't so concerned about capital appreciation, Buckle stock is a diamond in the rough. And who knows, it might figure out how to grow again.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-27	2019-06-27 20:56:55	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Forever 21 Officials Approached Landlords About Possible Purchase	(Bloomberg) -- A small faction of officials at Forever 21 Inc. has asked its biggest landlords if they’d consider taking a stake in the clothing retailer, as the company’s leadership battles internally about how to turn around the struggling store chain.The group, which didn’t have the backing of the company’s co-founder, talked to Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners LP about a range of options including a sale, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A rival set of officials, aligned with co-founder Do Won Chang, has opposed any such deal with landlords, the people said, as Chang wants to preserve control over the empire that made him a billionaire.A representative for Forever 21 said the company hasn’t had talks with landlords outside of rent negotiations. “While Forever 21’s policy is not to comment on speculations, we feel it’s important to refute these rumors, which are categorically incorrect,” the company said in a statement. “As a normal course of business, Forever 21 has been in regular rent renegotiation meetings. We have not had any conversations with mall operators regarding an investment in the company, nor a sale.”There is a precedent for landlords taking over retailers. Aeropostale Inc., the teen clothing store, sold itself in bankruptcy to a group including the two biggest U.S. mall owners in 2016. With Forever 21, the situation is fluid and it’s not clear how the company will restructure, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners, the biggest owners of malls in the U.S., are increasingly willing to discuss a wide range of options with tenants as retailers nationwide struggle to boost sales, including making steep concessions in leases. Online stores are winning more business, and malls are finding it harder to gain foot traffic.Representatives for Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners declined to comment.Forever 21 operates more than 800 stores in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America, with most in the U.S. Chang and his wife Jin Sook Chang, whose daughters now help run the company, opened their first store in Los Angeles in 1984 and established it as a destination for younger shoppers looking for trendy clothes at affordable prices. But competitors have crowded into the segment, from H&M to Target to new online sellers.Mall UpheavalForever 21 is a key tenant to both landlords. Indianapolis-based Simon, a real estate investment trust that is the largest U.S. mall owner, counts Forever 21 as its sixth-largest store tenant outside of department stores, with 99 outlets covering 1.5 million square that account for 1.4% of the company’s total base minimum rent in the U.S., according to a filing as of March 31.For Brookfield Property Partners -- a unit of Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management Inc. -- Forever 21 accounted for 2% of its minimum rents, according to a filing as of March 31. Brookfield last year bought GGP Inc., the second-largest U.S. mall operator.“Mall REIT exposure to Forever 21 is definitely bigger than most department stores, which pay very little base rent per square foot,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lindsay Dutch.Forever 21’s management, while fractured, has been busy over the past few weeks, holding discussions with lenders including Apollo Global Management LLC about potential bankruptcy financing. It has added investment bank Lazard Ltd. and law firm Kirkland & Ellis to its roster of advisers. It had tapped Latham & Watkins, its longtime legal counsel, for restructuring advice before adding Kirkland & Ellis. Latham & Watkins didn’t comment.The company is trying to avoid falling victim to the retail shakeout that destroyed dominant chains such as Borders Group and Sports Authority as consumers defected to online merchants. Many of the failed stores had been bought out by private equity firms that loaded the companies up with debt, leaving them unable to make investments needed to compete with rivals such as Amazon.com.(Updates with comment from BI analyst in paragraph 10.)&#92;--With assistance from Scott Deveau, Boris Korby and Kiel Porter.To contact the reporters on this story: Lauren Coleman-Lochner in New York at llochner@bloomberg.net;Eliza Ronalds-Hannon in New York at eronaldshann@bloomberg.net;Gillian Tan in New York at gtan129@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Dan WilchinsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forever-21-officials-approached-landlords-190628371.html?.tsrc=rss

While all REITs are likely to take a hit, some will present excellent buying opportunities, especially since you will be collecting relatively generous dividend yields in the meantime.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/65224583-a3cb-31ce-900b-4ed71c6dc288/10-biggest-reits%3A-an-overview.html?.tsrc=rss

When I thought about doing an article about stocks to buy hitting 52-week lows recently, a quick search of companies with a market cap of $2 billion or more revealed a total of 124 hitting 52-week lows.Fast forward three days later and there's only 22 stocks hitting 52-week lows according to Finviz.com.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow, I'm as game as the next person when it comes to picking possible stocks to buy, but given I'm attempting to choose one stock from seven different sectors, 22's not going to cut it.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% Therefore, to ensure I've got better options from as many sectors as possible, I've relaxed the qualifier to those companies trading within 5% of a stock's 52-week low. By doing so, I get a total of 120 stocks with a least one choice from eight different sectors, making the options a lot more palatable. Methanex (MEOH)As I write this, Methanex (NASDAQ:MEOH) is trading within seven cents of its 52-week low of $41.39, which is more than half its 52-week high of $83.23. Methanex is one of the world's largest producers of methanol which its customers to use to make everything from adhesives to windshield washer fluid. It also sells methanol to oil refiners who turn it into a high-octane fuel. Based in Vancouver, B.C., the company expects strong demand for methanol over the next four years with a growing piece of its business going to companies converting methanol to olefins which can then be turned into polyolefins, which are used to make all kinds of plastics. In late April, Raymond James analyst Steve Hansen suggested to clients that they consider Methanex stock because of its steep decline in price. Hansen's got an $80 price target and an outperform rating on it. &quot;We continue to recommend that investors accumulate MEOH shares based upon our constructive view on improving methanol fundamentals, the company's robust associated free cash flow profile, and the stock's attractive valuation,&quot; Hansen stated.Trading at a level it hasn't seen since June 2017, if the economy holds, MEOH is a bargain. Wolverine World Wide (WWW) Source: Brubastos via Flickr (modified)Wolverine World Wide (NYSE:WWW) is trading within 38 cents of its 52-week low of $27.64, which is 31% below its 52-week high of $39.77. Wolverine, known for footwear brands such as Keds, Hush Puppies, Skechers, Sperry, and many more, is having a tough time dealing with tariffs on the Chinese shoes it imports. It recently asked the Trump government to reconsider increasing these tariffs as it would mean American households would be paying as much as a 100% duty on shoes imported from China. &quot;While U.S. tariffs on all consumer goods average just 1.9 percent, they average 11.3 percent for footwear and reach rates as high as 67.5 percent. Adding a 25 percent tax increase on top of these tariffs would mean some working American families could pay a nearly 100 percent duty on their shoes,&quot; the letter stated.  * 5 Healthcare Stocks to Pick Up From the Wreckage While the near term doesn't look good for the Michigan company, it still anticipates revenue growth in the low-to-mid-single digits in 2019. Despite all the tariff troubles, it estimates adjusted earnings per share will be at least $2.20, which means it is currently trading at less than 13 times its forward earnings. By comparison, Nike (NYSE:NKE) trades at almost 27 times its forward earnings.  Simon Property Group (SPG)Source: m01229 via Flickr (Modified)Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is trading within 2% of its 52-week low of $159.69, which is 17% below its 52-week high of $191.41.Recently, a group by the name of Peer & Peri LLC made a mini-tender offer to purchase up to 20,000 of the mall owner's shares at a 21% discount to the $178.11 share price at the commencement of the offer on May 6. Down 8% since the offer was disclosed, it expired on June 6 at 5 p.m. Although Simon put out a statement recommending shareholders reject the below-market mini-tender offer, these things are intended to catch investors off guard, prompting them to mistakenly sell their shares at a discount. If you Google &quot;Peer & Peri LLC,&quot; you will see that it happens to a lot of reputable companies. I'm not sure why it's allowed to happen, but it is. Forbes contributor Sanford Stein, who's spent four decades studying retail, recently made a great observation about Simon.&quot;David Simon knows this stuff. That's why he is CEO of the largest mall developer in the country, with over 200 of the best remaining malls. It's also quite likely that when the 1,300 or so malls that exist today are reduced to 500 or 600, in say the next decade, Simon Property Group will still own and manage the best ones,&quot; Stein wrote May 14.  I like the idea of getting SPG stock at $140 a share, but I wouldn't recommend you try to do it the Peer & Peri LLC way. CVS Health (CVS)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrCVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is trading within 5% of its 52-week low of $51.72, which is 37% below its 52-week high of $82.15. CVS held its annual investor day June 4; a day in which CEO Larry Merlo spent most of his time assuring shareholders that its acquisition of Aetna would pay dividends in the long run despite the apparent near-term difficulties. Merlo sees the company generating double-digit sales growth in 2022 once the $70-billion purchase is fully integrated. CVS is building a vertically integrated health business that provides everything from insurance, prescription drug benefits, healthcare services, and retail drugstores. It expects to find at least $300 million in synergies in 2019 and $800 million in 2020. &quot;Keep in mind we're in the early innings of our transformational journey,&quot; Merlo told investors. &quot;This will be a multi-year journey with benefits building over time as we continue to build and refine new programs to better serve the needs of our stakeholders.&quot;I'm normally not a fan of large acquisitions, but given how incredibly dysfunctional the U.S. healthcare sector is, anything that reduces the cost while maintaining profitability, is bound to do well in the long run.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Don't Care About Tariffs Take advantage of the uncertainty to get a well-run company at a very reasonable price. Pentair (PNR)Source: HereStanding via Flickr (Modified)Pentair (NYSE:PNR) is trading within 3% of its 52-week low of $34.72, which is 25% below its 52-week high of $46.00.Pentair became a pure-play water company in April 2018 when it spun-off nVent Electric (NYSE:NVT), its electrical connection and solution company. As a result, Pentair now has three water-related businesses only: aquatic systems, filtration solutions, and flow technologies. Given the importance of water in our world, the hiving off of its electrical business allows Pentair to focus entirely on water technology.Although the company's first-quarter core revenues were down 4% over the same time last year and its adjusted earnings per share fell 12%, it still expects to report adjusted EPS of at least $2.30 in 2019, which means it's currently trading at less than 11 times its 2019 earnings. Furthermore, with three operating segments generating almost identical revenues, it's got downside protection built right into its business model. Should a recession come to pass, it won't be overly reliant on a single segment for sales. It's not a sexy business, but it's got an excellent 2.9% dividend yield to get paid until its growth initiatives take hold.   Urban Outfitters (URBN)Source: Shutterstock Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) is trading within 4% of its 52-week low of $22.19, which is 58% below its 52-week high of $52.50.Urban Outfitters has several issues that have brought its stock to its news in the past year. They include deteriorating business trends, difficult same-store sales comparisons, product issues at its Urban Outfitters brand, including a slowdown in women's apparel, and finally, a serious concern about tariffs on Chinese imports. That said, it continues to be one of the most financially sound retailers that's publicly traded. It finished the first quarter (April 30 quarter end) with no debt, $520 million in cash, and $447 million in free cash flow. Free cash flow yield is one of the metrics I use for non-financials to evaluate the relative value of a stock. In the case of URBN, it has an FCF yield of 23% based on an enterprise value of $1.94 billion.   * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% As long as it continues to deliver positive same-store sales growth, $23 ought to appear very cheap to investors.       Citrix (CTXS)Source: Shutterstock Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) is trading within 3% of its 52-week low of $93.12, which is 20% below its 52-week high of $116.82.Citrix, known for its on-premise software for making companies more productive, is moving to the cloud and subscription-based software offerings. The transformation is aimed at creating a platform that provides large enterprises with a hybrid cloud that can grow and adapt based on their needs. Change is always tricky, and while the transformation is expected to take several years, CEO David Henshall insists that it's the right thing to do for customers, employees, and shareholders. Citrix's Intelligent Workspace is a platform for company applications that operate intelligently to improve productivity. The company's goal is to provide enough productivity improvements through its platform to give users back one day of their work week lost to moving between applications. If you look at its revenues for the first quarter ended March 31, you'll see that Citrix's subscription revenues increased by 37% over a year earlier accounting for 19.7% of its overall revenue, 490 basis points higher than a year earlier.  As it invests in research and development for the Intelligent Workspace, its subscription revenues will continue to grow at a double-digit pace.  Down from its all-time high of $116.82, if it drops below $90, you're getting a terrific deal. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-10	2019-05-10 16:04:43	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks With More to Give	Income investing can sometimes feel like a give-and-take situation. You can get red-hot dividend growth from stocks, but those stocks often start at paltry yields that take a while to plump up. But high-yield dividend stocks have their own problems - some high yields are a warning flare from troubled companies, and other high yields are safe but stuck in neutral.But there are a few &quot;Goldilocks&quot; dividend stocks that offer just the right blend of ample current yield and the potential for income growth.The DIVCON system from exchange-traded fund provider Reality Shares can, among other things, help identify already high-dividend stocks that have the financial wherewithal to keep pushing their payments higher. DIVCON's dividend health methodology measures factors such as free cash flow, prior earnings growth and even bankruptcy risk to determine whether stocks are likely to increase their dividends - or even if they're at risk of cutting them. The result is a rating between 1 and 5, with low ratings (1-2) indicating shaky dividends, and high ratings (4-5) indicating healthy payouts that likely will expand in the future.Here are seven high-yield dividend stocks that DIVCON's ratings suggest have a good likelihood of future rate increases.

Simon is not affiliated in any way with Peer & Peri, the offer, or the offer documentation. However, the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 require Simon to publicize its position with respect to the offer.  Simon recommends against shareholders tendering shares in response to the offer, as the offer price was significantly below the market price of Simon's stock as of the commencement of the offer, and is also significantly below yesterday's closing price of $174.03."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/simon-property-group-recommends-shareholders-121800591.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-02-17	2019-02-17 13:46:54	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	A Dozen Great REITs for Income AND Diversification	One of the essential first lessons that investors learn is diversifying a portfolio reduces risk. That's because different assets often react differently to the same event. A downturn in one asset when interest rates rise, for example, may be counter-balanced by an upswing in another. By holding diverse assets, a portfolio becomes less sensitive to market swings.Diversification is recommended not only across asset classes, but across geographies. This is especially true for real estate, since the value of a property is largely determined by the local economy. A real estate investment trust (REIT) that performs poorly in the U.S. may generate good overall results from the performance of its European and Asian assets.Investors could be taking on unnecessary risk by limiting their holdings to US-centric REITs. Many large U.S. REITs recognize this threat and are diversifying their holdings across geographies. Global expansion not only trims geographic risk, but benefits overall performance by giving these REITs a foothold in faster-growing economies of Asia and Latin America, where an expanding middle class is fueling the creation of wealth.Here are 12 mega-sized REITs - many with rising dividends - that also offer diverse international exposure and generous yields. We've also included an extra real-estate play that's not organized as a REIT but is worthy nonetheless.

### NYSE:SPG

View full report here!

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is negative 
  * ETFs holding this stock are seeing positive inflows but are weakening 
  * Bearish sentiment is low



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for SPG with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting SPG.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Negative

ETF activity is negative and may be weakening. The net inflows of $894 million over the last one-month into ETFs that hold SPG are among the lowest of the last year and appear to be slowing.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Neutral

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Financials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Negative

The current level displays a negative indicator. Although SPG credit default swap spreads are decreasing, they are near their highest levels for the past 1 year, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

2019-01-18	2019-01-18 15:13:05	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	Realty Income Stock: Unlikely Success, Expensive Valuation	"Despite a severe industry slump, Realty Income (NYSE:O) continues to thrive. The San Diego-based real estate investment trust (REIT) just declared its 583rd monthly dividend amid ongoing revenue and profit growth. O stock certainly has stood out. Many of its peers such as Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) and Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) have struggled in recent years.

However, Wall Street has taken notice and as a result, the stock price has seen substantial increases over the last year. For this reason, prospective buyers should look past the rising dividend before buying Realty Income stock.

### Realty Income Thrives

Realty Income hit a milestone this month. In declaring its 100th hike in its monthly dividend, the payout for each month has reached 22.55 cents per share. It also marks its 583rd monthly dividend payment since the company began making payout about 50 years ago. It also stands out by paying dividends monthly.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As a retail REIT, its industry has faced some of the toughest time in its history. Faced with competition from online shopping, tenants have vacated retail spaces in droves. As a result, once thriving retail spaces have become derelict or have converted to other uses.

Fortunately for Realty Income, brick-and-mortar retail has not died, it is merely shrinking. Also, Realty Income serves tenants that sell products and services less conducive to online retailing. This includes properties such as pharmacies, movie theaters, and so-called &quot;dollar store&quot; retailers.

Moreover, most deals involve agreements known as triple-net leases. Hence, tenants take on the cost of taxes, maintenance, and insurance. The REIT has also diversified into industrial, office, and agricultural property types. These now make up about 19% of Realty Income's property holdings.

These factors should help O stock continue to thrive. Despite industry challenges, it has maintained a compound average annual return of 16.3% since 1994. With this continuing prosperity, the 100th dividend increase may just be the beginning.

### Beware the Rising O Stock Price

However, when one buys into a shrinking industry, it becomes more critical that investors buy at a low price to ensure they come out ahead. Despite serious industry challenges, this stock will not come cheap to investors.

The equity spent most of 2018 in a recovery mode. As a result, the stock now stands at $65 per share, close to its 52-week high. Even on a forward basis, this takes Realty Income stock to a price-to-earnings (PE) of around 46.

Such a multiple might appear reasonable for a high-growth company in an emerging high tech field. However, Realty Income operates in a shrinking industry that expects 8.7% profit growth for this year. Given the REIT's unlikely success, it deserves a higher multiple than its peers. Still, under those conditions, a 46 forward PE seems quite expensive.

Moreover, investors need to put the dividend in perspective. At a 4.2% yield, that comes in at almost double the S&P 500 average. However, the average dividend yield for equity REITs comes in at just under 4.4%.

Hence, O stock actually pays a below average dividend yield. While this payout also points to the company's success, it serves as another confirmation that the stock price has moved ahead of itself.

### Final Thoughts on O stock

Realty Income thrives in a declining industry. However, with the high PE and the average dividend yield, investors should consider staying away for now.

Amid falling demand for its particular type of real estate, Realty Income has continued to thrive. The REIT leases to clients less affected by online retail. It has also moved into other property types.

This has allowed the REIT to stay on a growth path. Still, Wall Street recognizes its success. As a result, the stock has become an expensive equity in a consolidating industry.

I believe Realty Income will thrive for decades to come. However, at its current earnings multiple, I would look for cheaper REITs operating in less challenged sectors.

2019-01-17	2019-01-17 16:56:52	SPG	Simon Property Group, Inc.	5 REITs to Buy for Big-Time Gains This Year	"Despite the evidence that real estate investment trusts (REITs) actually do well during periods of tightening, the sector has been hit particularly hard as the Federal Reserve has ratcheted-up rates. Over the last six months, the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:VNQ) is down by roughly 5%. That decline plays into the idea that when rates rise, REITs fall before snapping back. The only problem is market volatility has prevented the snap-back.

That's left plenty of big-time and high-yielding bargains in the sector.

And with the rising market volatility, the Fed may be stepping off the brakes. Already, Chairman Jerome Powell has turned a bit dovish and the lack of inflation means that the Fed doesn't need to tame the economy like it was doing. For investors, this could be the go-ahead for many high-yielding sectors, including REITs.

With that, here are five REITs to buy that could run-up big for the rest of the year.

### Digital Realty Trust (DLR)

Dividend Yield: 3.79%

There's no denying that the world continues to become more digital. Technology has invaded our lives like never before. And all of that, from cloud computing to mobile commerce, requires one thing. And that's tons and tons of server computers. The problem is owning specialized buildings and all that necessary hardware to keep them running is a very expensive proposition for many firms. This is especially true for smaller startups.

That's where Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) comes in.

DLR owns over 195 data centers across the globe. Here, the REIT hosts firms' web and cloud services, keeps the data centers cool and running smoothly, then sits back and collects a fee from its tenants. Those tenants include a who's who of some of the largest corporations on the planet. Top customers include AT&T (NYSE:T), Snap (NASDAQ:SNAP) and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL).

The continued need for more data hosting has only benefited DLR over the long run. Since 2005, Digital Realty's core funds from operations -- the key metric of a REIT's health -- has grown at a CAGR of 13%. Those gains have led to 13 years' worth of dividend increases. Today, DLR yields close to 4%.

With the future becoming more tech-focused, DLR could be one of the best REITs to hold for the long haul.

Our population continues to get larger and older as new drugs and therapies keep us alive. It stands to reason that more healthcare demand will require more places to provide care. Some of the best opportunities for investors could be with those firms that own all the real estate related to hospitals, doctors' offices, senior living facilities, etc.

Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) is an elder statesmen of healthcare REITs.

VTR owns roughly 1,200 different medically related buildings. The best part is that Ventas doesn't really deal with any of the regulation, drug pricing or costs related to healthcare. It simply owns the hospital building. That frees it from all the hassles that come along with medicine. Even better is that VTR has pivoted its portfolio toward life science and research, partnering with some of the largest medical schools/labs in the country. This provides it with high rents and long leases.

All in all, VTR's focus has allowed it to scale-up and provide plenty of dividend growth and returns for investors. Since 2001, Ventas has been able to grow its dividend by 8% annually. Today, VTR yields a healthy 5.23%.

Given the continued demand for healthcare, REITs like Ventas have plenty of opportunities to keep growing over the long haul. For investors, VTR stock makes a great addition to any portfolio.

### Extra Space Storage, Inc. (EXR)

Dividend Yield: 3.76%

Americans have a lot of stuff. The job of providing a place to stash our Christmas decorations, R.V.s and vintage beanie babies falls to a subset of REITs that own self-storage facilities. At first glance, REITs like Extra Space Storage, Inc. (NYSE:EXR) seem pretty boring. That is until you realize the sheer amount of growth behind them.

EXR has benefited from the last recession in spades and America's housing crisis. For starters, the trend toward downsizing has created a real space crunch for many people. People are buying smaller homes and many retiring Baby Boomers are looking to cash out the equity in the residences. But still, they are keeping much of their possessions. Secondly, while credit trends have improved, it's still pretty hard to buy a home in many areas. This has created a nation of renters. Extra Space Storage and its rivals have capitalized on this trend in a big way.

The REIT owns a whopping 1,606 different self-storage facilitates across the country. And EXR continues to expand that portfolio via smart acquisitions. Most of the sector is owned by mom & pop operators, so there are plenty of opportunities to scale up. In doing that, Extra Space has steadily managed to grow its FFO and operating revenues. Since 2006, FFO at EXR has managed to surge by more than 600%. That beats the pants off its rivals.

With strong annual dividend growth and continued high occupancy, EXR could be one of the top REITs to own over the next few years.

### AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB)

Dividend Yield: 3.27%

Speaking of the nation of renters, demand for apartments, townhomes and other multifamily units has continued to surge. So much so, that rents are expected to surge by more than inflation once again in 2019. This has been a boon for apartment REITs like AvalonBay Communities Inc. (NYSE:AVB).

AVB owns 84,490 apartment homes, making it one of the largest landlords in the entire country. Moreover, it has been pruning its portfolio and adding new construction to some of the fastest/strongest areas of the country. Today, the vast bulk of its holdings exist in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest and Northern and Southern California. This has allowed Avalon to see strong occupancy rates and rent growth over the last few years. For the first three quarters of 2018, rents have grown by more than 2.4% -- a number that even beat AVB's own projections. This has naturally translated to strong FFO and dividend growth for the REIT.

Since its IPO, AVB has managed to grow its dividend by an average of 5.3% per year. That's not shabby at all considering the sheer size of the firm and the number of apartments it owns. All in all, that dividend growth as well as capital appreciation has managed to produce a steady 13% annual return for investors in the REIT.

And given the trends in leasing and renter growth, there's no reason why AVB can't keep the streak going.

### iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (USRT)

Dividend Yield: 4.46%

Given the sheer number of bargains among REITs today, a broad approach may be best. And you can't get better than the iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (NYSEARCA:USRT). In its short history, the ETF has proven to be a winner for investors.

USRT tracks the FTSE NAREIT Equity REITs Index, which is one of the gold standards when it comes benchmarking the sector. The ETF owns more than 150 different large- and mid-cap REITs. This extensive coverage includes exposure to industry stalwarts like Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG) and Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP). It also hits all the main property types: apartment buildings, medical, offices, retail, etc. That comes all within one ticker. What it does not include is so-called mortgage REITs, which own paper and loan money to builders and developers.

This broad exposure makes USRT a perfect way for investors to add REITs to their portfolio.

Performance for the fund has been pretty good as well. Over the last ten years, USRT has managed to produce an 11.35% average annual return. With nearly $1 billion in assets, swift trading volume and a low 0.08% expense ratio, USRT makes a great addition to play the rise in REITs.

As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is negative 
  * Bearish sentiment is low



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest is extremely low for SPG with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting SPG.

## Money flow

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Neutral

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Financials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however.

## Credit worthiness
