Estee Lauder’s 1Q Results Exceed Expectations; Shares Fall 8%	"Shares of Estee Lauder (EL) plunged 7.94% yesterday, despite the company reporting better-than-expected sales and earnings in 3Q 2021. The sell-off came on the back of the company’s warning of potential continued weakness in retail traffic owing to COVID-19 restrictions. COVID-19 remains a big headwind disrupting the company's operating environment. Estee Lauder delivered a 16% increase in net sales to $3.35 billion. Sales grew in every region and across most business units, reflecting the ongoing recovery. The company also bounced back to profitability posting net earnings of $456 million compared to a net loss of $6 million in the prior-year period. Net earnings per common share came in at $1.24 compared to a $0.02 net loss reported in the same period last year. “Our growth engines of Skin Care and Fragrance were incredibly powerful. Sales rose in every region, led by double-digit growth in Asia/Pacific, where many markets contributed and sales growth in mainland China accelerated. Online thrived as a growth engine, with sales having increased strong double-digits around the world, and Travel Retail excelled,"" said CEO, Fabrizio Freda. Backed by strong cash flow generation, Estee Lauder resumed share repurchases in the quarter. In addition, the company continues to implement cost controls in certain areas of the business. Management expects full-year sales to increase between 11% and 12%. EPS is projected to be between $5.31 and $5.48 for the full year. (See Estee Lauder stock analysis on TipRanks). Amid the recent share price drop, Oppenheimer analyst, Rupesh Parikh has reiterated a Buy rating. According to the analyst, Estee Lauder boasts strong long-term prospects. “We expect the share price weakness to be short-lived as fundamentals likely continue to strengthen as makeup rebounds in coming quarters. Management reiterated confidence in a full makeup recovery, which should help to potentially catapult results even further above pre-pandemic levels,"" Parikh wrote in a research note to investors. Parikh has a $300 price target on the stock implying 3.83% upside potential to current levels. Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 15 Buy and 2 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $337.56 implies 16.83% upside potential to current levels. EL scores a 7 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, implying it is most likely to perform in line with market expectations.

Estee Lauder Sales Fall Short Despite Hint of Travel Rebound	(Bloomberg) -- Estee Lauder Cos. reported quarterly sales that came in short of analysts’ estimates despite early signs of travel bouncing back.Sales rose in every region but didn’t meet expectations, with demand for makeup still stifled as customers don’t see many occasions to wear cosmetics like lipstick. Global net sales for the fiscal third quarter ended March 31 rose 16% to $3.86 billion, or 13% excluding currency fluctuations, the company said Monday in a statement.Resurgences in Covid-19 cases also caused temporary shutdowns of stores in important markets including the U.K., Japan, Canada, France and Brazil. Consumer traffic to stores remains down globally compared to pre-pandemic levels, the company said.Net sales for makeup declined across nearly all of Estee Lauder’s brands. Products like foundation and lip gloss have been particularly hurt by the pandemic, with workers yet to fully return to offices during the day and nightlife still muted in many countries around the world. The only region that saw growth in makeup last quarter was Asia.The shares fell as much as 4.6% in New York trading Monday. They had climbed 18% this year through April 30.Skin CareSkin care continues to perform well. In February, Estee Lauder agreed to increase its stake in Deciem, owner of the Ordinary cosmetics brand, for about $1 billion, and plans to buy the remaining interest in three years. The transaction is expected to be completed in May.The cosmetics giant said signs of a travel recovery were apparent, with shoppers returning to stores in transit hubs as tourism starts to inch back after grinding to a near total halt amid travel restrictions and shutdowns. Estee Lauder’s global travel retail business for the quarter grew year-over-year despite a lack of international travelers. That includes stores in places like airports and train stations.“We expect the momentum in our sales growth to build in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, not only from easing comparisons but also fundamental strength, as we drive recovery,” said Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda.The company expects reported net sales to climb as much as 12% this fiscal year, or as much as 10% excluding currency impacts.(Updates with chart, other details throughout)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estee-lauder-sales-fall-short-133700008.html?.tsrc=rss

The stock is currently under from its 52 week high by 3.12%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.

Estee Lauder to Pay $1 Billion for Most of Deciem Skin Care	(Bloomberg) -- Estee Lauder Cos. agreed to pay $1 billion to boost its stake in Deciem Inc., giving the Canadian skin-care company an enterprise value of $2.2 billion as the cosmetics giant moves toward a full takeover.Estee Lauder will raise its stake in Deciem to 76% from 29% with the deal, which it expects to close in the quarter ending June 30, the New York-based company said in a statement Tuesday. Estee Lauder agreed to buy the rest of Deciem after three years.Deciem had sales of $460 million in the year ended Jan. 31, Estee Lauder said, describing the company as “an industry disruptor with a consumer-focused approach.”Brandon Truaxe, who died two years ago at the age of 40, founded Deciem in 2013. The Toronto-based company attracted a cult following, including Kim Kardashian, after launching The Ordinary, a line of products with familiar ingredients priced at under $10. Estee Lauder invested an undisclosed amount in the company in 2016 and its portfolio grew.A couple of months before he died, Truaxe told staff that he was shutting down Deciem until further notice, citing “major criminal activity” by employees. Estee Lauder took legal action against Truaxe. An Ontario judge ousted him as chief executive officer and forced him from Deciem’s board.There was no hint of that past rancor in the Tuesday statement. “Brandon dreamed of ELC being the forever home for Deciem, and we are truly humbled to achieve his vision today,” said co-founder Nicola Kilner, the current CEO.Skin care continues to be the growth driver for Estee Lauder as makeup sales shrink, accounting for 58% of the company’s revenue in its most recent quarter. Shoppers have gravitated toward self-care items like moisturizer and serums but have seen little need for foundation and lipstick as coronavirus restrictions keep them at home.Estee Lauder shares were down 0.2% to $284.95 at 9:39 a.m. in New York. They are up 7.1% this year and gained 29% last year.(Updates with shares in final paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estee-lauder-pay-1-billion-125512468.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-08	2021-02-08 22:39:13	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	Here's Why Estée Lauder Is Impressing Analysts	Estée Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE: EL) reported its second-quarter 2021 earnings Feb. 5 and its sales revenue rose 5% year over year, beating estimates despite less foot traffic and some closure of stores throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. “Our multiple engines of growth strategy continued to prove its value, enabling us to pivot with agility in this challenging moment,” Fabrizio Freda, president and CEO, said on the conference call. Freda attributed large segments of Estée Lauder’s growth to both the growing demand for its products in the Asia-Pacific and its pivot to capturing customers online through its Virtual Try-On technology and customer/beauty advisor video chat services. Estée Lauder reported sales revenue of $4.85 billion compared to the Street estimate of $4.49 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.61 compared to the estimate of $1.69. The Estée Lauder Analysts: Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser reiterated a Buy rating and increased a price target from $259 to $320. Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian reiterated an Overweight rating and increased a price target from $285 to $312. Raymond James analyst Joseph Altobello maintained a Market Perform rating. Estée Lauder’s High-Growth Strategy: Estée Lauder’s continued e-commerce strength, Chinese consumer sales growth and growth in travel retail is “a very impressive accomplishment in the middle of a pandemic,” Mohsenian said in a note. View more earnings on EL Speaking about these three areas of growth, Mohsenian added, “We continue to believe in our long-standing call that Estée is transforming to a higher growth and higher margin company as mix shifts to these value drivers, which is occurring at an even greater pace than expected based on FQ2 results.” Altobello wrote, “In addition to the better than expected sales (particularly in Asia-Pacific), gross margin was modestly better than expected (77.7% vs. RJe 76.0%), reflecting a mix shift toward skin care and online.” However, Altobello also noted Estée Lauder will feel margin pressure in coming quarters as employees return to work and advertising and promotions ramp up, but said the e-commerce platform will continue to provide cost savings. Weiser pointed to Estée Lauder’s growth in the travel retail sector of its sales, especially in China. Travel retail revenue was up single digits for the fourth quarter, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and Weiser said, “Travel retail benefited from robust growth in Hainan and strong conversion rates.” Mohsenian also noted consumer engagement “improved with its loyalty program growing strong double digits, driven by triple-digit growth of international loyalty program members.” In an interview with Jim Cramer this past Friday, Freda also highlighted the success of the loyalty program and said, “marketing will get consumers to try your product, but only quality will get them to purchase it again.” EL Price Action: The stock closed Monday's session up 2.8% at $280.54.

2021-02-08	2021-02-08 19:23:26	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	Price Over Earnings Overview: Estee Lauder Cos	In the current session, Estee Lauder Cos Inc. (NYSE:EL) is trading at $281.11, after a 3.01% gain. Over the past month, the stock increased by 10.07%, and in the past year, by 33.99%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently higher from its 52 week high by 1.51%. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.

Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 45.28 in the Personal Products industry, Estee Lauder Cos Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 163.36. Shareholders might be inclined to think that Estee Lauder Cos Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It's also possible that the stock is overvalued.

Estee Lauder reports a big profit beat, but provides downbeat guidance	Estee Lauder Companies reported Friday a fiscal second-quarter profit that was well above expectations, as revenue also rose above forecasts, but provided a downbeat outlook for the current quarter as a resurgence in COVID-19 cases has led to renewed government restrictions.

Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $2.55, above the FactSet consensus of $1.69. Sales grew 5% to $4.85 billion, topping the FactSet consensus of $4.49 billion. Skin care sales jumped 28% to $2.82 billion to beat the FactSet consensus of $2.44 billion; makeup sales dropped 25% to $1.25 billion, missing expectations of $1.36 billion; fragrance sales rose 6% to $618 million, beating expectations of $534.5 million; and hair care sales slipped 5% to $154 million, below forecasts of $163.5 million. For the third quarter, the company expects adjusted EPS of $1.10 to $1.20, below the FactSet consensus of $1.46, and expects sales growth of 13% to 14%, while current expectations of $3.86 billion implies 15.3% growth.

2020-12-07	2020-12-07 13:30:12	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	Stuck at Home, Still Seeking a Good Hair Day	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Stay-at-home living has given makeup wearers dramatically fewer occasions to draw on a smoky eye or a red lip, and the cosmetics business is feeling the pain. Ulta Beauty Inc. last week said comparable sales fell 8.9% in the latest quarter, with declines in foot traffic and weak makeup sales dragging down results. In the upscale segment of the U.S. beauty industry, sales sank 17% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to NPD Group. But that’s only a skin-deep explanation of what’s shaping beauty spending now. The situation is more nuanced than those numbers would suggest. And mercifully, for retailers and brands, there are pockets of real strength.Besides there being few reasons to glam up, the beauty business is hurting because it benefits enormously from customers being able to try out the products, and options for doing so at brick-and-mortar stores are extremely limited thanks to pandemic safety precautions. Ulta and Sephora stores have each designated tester products as “display only,” meaning that a key part of the pleasure of shopping at these stores — to see if a skin cream feels greasy on your hands or a certain blush color looks clownish on your skin tone — is off-limits. Both chains also temporarily halted some high-contact services, including in-store makeovers. Department-store beauty counters are less experiential these days, too, with the likes of Macy’s Inc. and Nordstrom Inc. retreating from in-store makeup applications for now. In other words, it’s not just that demand for certain beauty products has been decimated, but it’s also that key selling techniques can’t be used. Another of the beauty industry’s less obvious challenges is the plunge in air travel since the onset of the pandemic. Cosmetics, skin-care products and fragrances are popular purchases at airport gift shops and duty-free stores. In its latest annual report, Estee Lauder Cos. said travel retail outposts were “historically one of our most profitable channels.” These shopping environments are ghost towns these days, though. Dufry AG, a company with more than 2,500 travel retail stores worldwide, said sales of perfumes and cosmetics were down 82.1% in the third quarter from a year earlier. Despite all this, there are growth opportunities for beauty brands that meet consumers where they are: at home. Just because people are stuck inside doesn’t mean they are letting themselves go — in many cases, it’s the opposite. Being homebound and stressed out has led many shoppers to seek sanity in the form of self-care, and beauty items that allow for some of the rituals one might previously have gotten from a spa or salon treatment are enjoying a moment. Sales of nail products in the upscale beauty segment were up 13% from a year earlier in the third quarter, according to NPD, while body exfoliators jumped 48%. Hair care provides an especially clear example: Sales were up 11% overall thanks to growth in products such as hair masks, color and treatments. The one subcategory that declined was styling — which is logical, because it’s hard to imagine anyone crafting an elaborate chignon to sit around watching Netflix. While Ulta’s results didn’t precisely mirror those of the wider upscale market, they certainly reflected an embrace of at-home self care. The chain actually recorded an increase in comparable sales in its hair-care, skin-care, bath and fragrance segments. The resilience of the non-makeup parts of the beauty business helps explain a one-two punch of recent high-profile strategic partnerships. Target Corp. said in November it is set to open 100 Ulta shop-in-shops within its stores, while Kohl’s Corp. answered with a splashy announcement that it will offer Sephora shop-in-shops in about 850 stores. Large-format retailers want a bigger share of what looks to be a promising market over the long term, and specialists like Ulta and Sephora should help them achieve that.There is no doubt beauty retailers and brands will be in better shape when parties, first dates and other primp-worthy occasions return in full force. Until then, though, they can count on scrubs, scents and other soothing gear to keep things from getting too ugly. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

(NYSE: EL) is trading at $249.00, after a 0.32% increase. Over the past month, the stock increased by 12.23%, and in the past year, by 30.38%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 2.76%.  The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.

2020-11-11	2020-11-11 16:18:37	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	Alibaba Singles’ Day Ends Strongly as Beijing Crackdown Looms	(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. posted sales of $75 billion during the world’s largest shopping binge, wrapping up an annual frenzy of Chinese consumption that this year was overshadowed by escalating regulatory scrutiny over the country’s giant internet sector.Sales during the Singles’ Day festival totaled 498.2 billion yuan at the end of Nov. 11, easily surpassing 2019’s $38 billion official tally after Alibaba added several days and additional services to the count for the first time. Unlike past years, Alibaba didn’t provide detailed breakdowns about what got sold apart from tidbits like the fact its Tmall platform logged 583,000 orders in one second at its peak.Investors watched Alibaba’s bargains bonanza for signs that Chinese consumers were raring to fire up the country’s post-pandemic recovery. But the headline numbers took a backseat to concerns that regulators are seeking to curtail the growing influence of Alibaba and other Chinese internet leaders. Shares of Alibaba, the largest of the country’s tech firms, plunged 9.8% in Hong Kong Wednesday, taking losses to more than $115 billion since Beijing this week unveiled new antitrust regulations governing the sector’s dominant players.Singles’ Day debuted in 2009 and has grown over a decade into a nationwide marathon of frantic bargain-hunting that dwarfs sales events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday in both intensity and size. 2020’s edition features a record number of brand names from Apple to Nike betting that -- after months of Covid-enforced abstention -- China’s 400 million-strong middle class is ready to spend on everything from Hainan beach-side vacations to takeaway coupons and electronics.Alibaba has been benefiting after the pandemic forced Chinese consumers -- who already buy about 30% of the nation’s retail purchases online -- to accelerate their shift to e-commerce. Homebound consumers turned grocery delivery into the industry’s hottest arena, anchoring an unprecedented surge in online activity during the nationwide lockdown. Domestic travel is accelerating, propping up Alibaba businesses such as Fliggy, while a raft of new smartphones launched during the quarter is expected to tap pent-up demand for electronics.“We are seeing Chinese customers releasing the strong consumption demand during the event,” Liu Bo, general manager of Tmall marketing and operations. Core consumers, the country’s middle class, have demonstrated a solid appetite for shopping as a way to compensate for not being able to travel overseas, he added.The strong start to this year’s sales fiesta -- also known as “Double 11” -- may bode well for China’s economy, providing further evidence that consumer spending, so far a laggard in the recovery, is strengthening.“Double 11 has historically served as a very accurate indicator for what’s happening in the following year for retailers, brands as well as consumers,” said Jonathan Cheng, head of China retail at Bain & Co. “For this year, with Covid, it’ll become more important. And if you look at China, which is the first one to be coming out of Covid, it’s gonna be an indicator for other countries as well.”The brainchild of co-founder Jack Ma and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang, Single’s Day was intended to be an antidote to the sentimentality of Valentine’s Day. It takes its name from the way the day is written numerically as 11/11, which resembles “bare branches,” a local expression for the unattached. Along the way, the company created the world’s largest shopping festival that has helped to propel Alibaba into a Goliath.It’s also become an annual showcase for Alibaba’s cloud services as well as affiliate Ant Group Co.’s Alipay mobile wallet. A record event would be another feather in the cap for Ant, which could do with a win after tightening regulatory scrutiny that torpedoed its initial public offering last week.Livestream GalaIn a nod to the pandemic, Alibaba scaled back on live events this year and is instead relying on increased online promotions such as celebrity livestreams to draw hundreds of millions of shoppers to its e-commerce platforms. Pop star Katy Perry performed at an online event Tuesday, four years after she pulled out from Alibaba’s annual live extravaganza to mark the shopping festival. Alongside the usual 24-hour sales period on Wednesday, 2020’s event featured an additional window for consumers to make purchases from Nov. 1-3.Shoppers can purchase heavily discounted goods like cosmetics, clothing and groceries from its Taobao and Tmall platforms and have them shipped via the company’s Cainiao logistics service, and book flights to domestic tourist hotspots on the Fliggy travel website. Kaola -- purchased from NetEase Inc. last year -- is participating for the first time, offering goods from 89 countries to consumers.Foreign consumer brands have long relied on Alibaba to gain access to the Chinese middle class. That’s especially true this year, given how most economies elsewhere are grappling with a resurgence in the pandemic. During the first 111 minutes of sales on Nov. 1, Nike Inc. and Apple Inc. were among 100 brands that reported 100 million yuan ($15 million) in transactions. And Estee Lauder’s flagship store on Alibaba’s Tmall platform was the first to surpass 1 billion yuan in sales, the e-commerce company said. International hotel groups Marriott International Inc. and Accor SA also passed the 1 billion yuan transaction mark for the first time.Read more: Magic Johnson Selling Gels Shows Why Alibaba Escaped TrumpSales DiscountsExpectations are high for Alibaba. Revenue in the September quarter grew at the slowest on record for the period, with customers putting off purchases on its Taobao and Tmall platforms in anticipation of deep bargains ahead. “The performance of Singles Day might be a more important benchmark to look at, rather than the third quarter result,” said Steven Zhu, an analyst with Pacific Epoch.As with previous years, Alibaba and its e-commerce rivals rolled out ever-larger promotions to entice consumers. Over the entire Single’s Day event, merchants could end up forking over a record 30 billion yuan in discounts and subsidies to goose sales across Tmall and Taobao alone, CLSA Ltd. analysts led by Elinor Leung estimated.Those discounts may be the key to enticing consumers, which have only just started to loosen their purse-strings, to keep spending. China’s retail sales climbed 3.3% in September from a year ago and growth may have accelerated to 5% in October, as travel and other consumption picked up during the golden week holiday at the start of the month.But overall retail sales are still down for the year -- shrinking about 7% in the first nine months from the same period in 2019 -- and it remains to be seen if strong spending during national holidays and one-off shopping events like Singles’ Day will translate into a sustained recovery. Private consumption accounted for no more than 0.5 percentage point of GDP growth in the third quarter and a full recovery in consumer confidence may only come in 2021, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group economist Xing Zhaopeng.“Singles’ Day should see spending higher than a year ago but keep in mind retail sales were growing at 8% before Covid-19,” said Shaun Roache, Asia-Pacific chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. “If Singles’ Day is much better than expected, we should watch sales activity closely in December to see if this is a genuine pick-up or consumers are simply stocking up and staying cautious.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/katy-perry-drafted-singles-day-021435492.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-03	2020-11-03 13:21:01	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	Estée Lauder Beats Q1 Forecasts On Strength in Skincare, Asia Pacific	Beauty company Estée Lauder delivered better-than-anticipated results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 (ended Sept. 30) even as the pandemic continued to hurt the sales of its makeup products. Shares of Estée Lauder, which owns popular brands like Tommy Hilfiger, M·A·C and Clinique, rose 1.9% on Monday in reaction to the results.Estée Lauder’s (EL) 1Q FY21 sales declined 8.5% to $3.56 billion as a 10% gain in the Skin Care division was offset by a 32% and 12% drop in the company’s Makeup and Fragrance businesses. However, the company exceeded analysts’ sales forecast of $3.46 billion. Also, 1Q adjusted EPS declined about 14% year-over-year to $1.44 but easily surpassed analysts’ estimate of $0.90.Meanwhile, within the Skin Care division, the company’s namesake Estée Lauder brand and La Mer brand experienced robust demand. Sales from Asia-Pacific grew 9% in 1Q mainly due to strength in China and South Korea, while sales from the Americas and Europe, the Middle East & Africa declined 25% and 8%, respectively. Estée Lauder also experienced strong online sales during the quarter while traffic in the reopened stores continued to be weak due to COVID-19. (See EL stock analysis on TipRanks)For 2Q FY21, the company expects its sales to decline by 3%-5% year-over-year. It guided for adjusted EPS of between $1.45 and $1.60. Estée Lauder did not provide any guidance for the full-year FY21 given the uncertainty associated with COVID-19.Following the earnings release, Berenberg Bank analyst Fulvio Cazzol raised his price target for Estée Lauder stock to $259 from $244 and reiterated a Buy rating. He opined, “The solid performance across EL’s strategic priorities, which include skin care (up 4% year-over-year on a lfl basis), Asia-Pacific (up 7%) and e-commerce (up 40%), is encouraging, but a recovery in make-up (-32%) and further improvement in fragrances (-13%) may still depend on how quickly consumer habits return to 'normal'.”“While this may be somewhat outside of management’s control, we are pleased that management continues to invest for growth (innovations accounted for 30% of group sales in Q1 FY 2021, versus the 20-25% levels in previous quarters), which have supported market share growth, particularly in China where EL’s growth of c30% was well above the market’s 20%,” added Cazzol.The Street is cautiously optimistic about Estée Lauder. A Moderate Buy analyst consensus for the stock is based on 11 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell. With shares rising 8.4% year-to-date, the average analyst price target of $232.86 implies a modest upside potential of 4% in the coming months.Related News:  Mondelez Beats Q3 Estimates On Elevated Demand In Developed Markets  Clorox Hikes 2021 Guidance Due To Cleaning Bonanza; Shares Rise 4%  Skechers Falls 9% Despite Earnings Beat, Street Stays Bullish More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Tupperware Nabs $275M Loan To Boost Capital Structure; Stock Up 258% YTD   * Humanigen Inks First Asia Licensing Deal For Its Covid-19 Treatment   * Twitter Board Confident In Leadership Structure Post Review; Shares Rise   * PayPal Shares Fall 4% As 4Q Earnings Outlook Lags Estimates	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-beats-q1-132101585.html?.tsrc=rss

Estee Lauder beats earnings expectations on strong skin care sales, but provides downbeat outlook	"Estee Lauder Companies  reported a fiscal first-quarter profit and sales that beat expectations, as a strong performance in skin care sales offset weakness in makeup, but provided a downbeat earnings outlook for the current quarter. The stock was still inactive in premarket trading. Net income for the quarter to Sept. 30 fell to $523 million, or $1.42 a share, from $595 million, or $1.61 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 was well above the FactSet consensus of 90 cents. Sales declined 9% to $3.56 billion, but topped the FactSet consensus of $3.46 billion. Skin care sales rose 10% to $2.04 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $1.89 billion; makeup sales fell 32% to $978 million to miss expectations of $1.24 billion; fragrance sales dropped 12% to $406 million to fall shy of expectations of $408.3 million; and hair care sales were flat at $136 million to beat expectations of $124.7 million. ""The COVID-19-related closures of offices, retail stores and other businesses and the significant decline in social gatherings have also influenced consumer preferences and practices,"" the company stated. ""Demand for skin care and hair care products has been more resilient than the demand for makeup and overall fragrance."" For the second quarter, the company expects adjusted EPS of $1.45 to $1.60, below the FactSet consensus of $1.73. Earlier, the company said it raised its dividend by 10%. The stock has gained 6.4% year to date through Friday, while the S&P 500  has tacked on 1.2%."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d37f2c1b-f509-3e71-a7b1-636697005521/estee-lauder-beats-earnings.html?.tsrc=rss

The net sales decline was driven by some temporary retail store closures and lower foot traffic in open stores attributable to COVID-19, partially offset by strong growth online. Travel retail net sales were relatively flat year-over-year and net sales from the Company’s acquisition of Have&Be Co. Ltd.

2020-11-02	2020-11-02 07:09:52	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	Daily Spotlight: Investors Like November	The U.S. stock market tends to rise, despite historically difficult October. This long-term upward trajectory has its foundation in the country's democratic political system and its market-based, capitalist economic system. In theory, the stock market efficiently allocates the nation's capital to generate solid investment returns. Theory typically turns into reality in November, which since 1980 has been the second-best month for equity performance, with an average 1.7% gain, narrowly trailing April (+1.8%) but ahead of December (+1.2%) and January (+1.1%).  November's batting average is high as well: stocks rise during the month 73% of the time. The best Novembers have been 1980 (+10.2%), 2001 (+7.5%), 1996 (+7.3%), 1985 (+6.5%) and 1998 (+5.9%). Clunkers include 2000 (-8%), 2008 (-7.5%) and 1987 (-5.9%).  The month usually starts at a fast pace, as some companies are still reporting 3Q earnings, nonfarm payrolls are reported and IPOs are launched before the holiday season. By Thanksgiving, volume dwindles.  This November is different, of course, with the pandemic, recession and election. Those are three tall hurdles for the market to overcome in a historically strong month for stocks.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3cf3e75a-965f-3b0e-84d7-170d07783c25/daily-spotlight%3A-investors.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-13	2020-10-13 05:34:57	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	Coty vs Estée Lauder: Which Beauty Stock Is A Better Buy Amid The Pandemic?	The beauty industry is facing tough times as the demand for makeup products has drastically been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical distancing, remote working, mask-wearing and fewer social events have impacted the use of makeup products and are significantly pulling down the sales of companies like Coty, Estée Lauder and Ulta Beauty.However, the skincare category has been more resilient comparatively. A study by The NPD Group indicates that about 40% of facial skincare users are using their products, like cleansers and moisturizers, more often amid the pandemic. Also, beauty companies are witnessing a sharp rise in their e-commerce sales as customers are avoiding shopping at physical stores due to COVID-19 fears.Amid these changing dynamics, we will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool to analyze Coty and Estée Lauder and see which beauty company is well-positioned for long-term growth.Coty (COTY)The pandemic has added to the woes of beleaguered beauty giant Coty. The company has been under tremendous pressure since it acquired over 40 beauty brands from Procter & Gamble in 2016. The addition of P&G’s struggling brands dragged down Coty’s performance and the deal also added huge debt to its balance sheet. In fiscal 2019 (ended Jun. 30, 2019), the company recorded asset impairment charges of $3.7 billion mainly related to the acquired brands.Last year, JAB Holding, Coty’s largest shareholder, increased its stake in the company to 60% from 40% in an attempt to control the operational missteps and send a signal to the investors that it is confident of Coty's turnaround.Frequent changes in the executive suite have also impacted the company. On Sept. 1, Sue Y. Nabi assumed the position of Coty’s CEO. Nabi has rich experience in the beauty space, notably a 20-year tenure at L’Oréal. Nabi is the fifth CEO appointed by Coty since the company acquired P&G Brands in 2016.Last year, Coty announced a multi-year turnaround plan to optimize its operational model, accelerate its e-commerce growth and deleverage its balance sheet. Coty also aims to reduce its cost base by 25% by the end of FY23.But, the pandemic has made the company’s turnaround a difficult task. Coty’s revenue fell 63% Y/Y to $560 million in 4Q FY20 (ended June 30) reflecting the impact of COVID-19, especially on the cosmetic and professional beauty categories. Revenue fell 60% on an organic basis. The company posted an adjusted loss per share of $0.51 in 4Q FY20 compared to adjusted EPS of $0.16 in 4Q FY19.Coty stated that it experienced significant improvement in July and August across its portfolio and expects to return to profitability in 1Q FY21.To lower its debt, Coty has secured a $1 billion direct investment from KKR through convertible preferred shares and inked a deal to divest 60% of its professional beauty and retail hair businesses including the Wella, Clairol, OPI and ghd brands for $2.5 billion to KKR. (See COTY stock analysis on TipRanks)To capture the demand for digitally-native brands, Coty acquired a 51% stake in Kylie Jenner’s cosmetic line and recently announced a strategic partnership with Kim Kardashian West to buy a 20% stake in the celebrity’s make-up brand KKW for $200 million. The company also intends to address its under-exposure in growth areas like skincare, Northern Asia, and e-commerce.Last week, Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink upgraded Coty to Buy from Hold but kept the price target unchanged at $4. The analyst commented, “We are upgrading to Buy based on prospects for directional improvement & stock trade higher. We expect NT [near term] fundamentals to remain weak; trimming estimates accordingly.”“A new CEO brings needed depth of industry expertise and recent bold actions signal a sense of urgency to derisk costs & the balance sheet. We're still unresolved on Kylie & KKW and the weight to the turnaround; we'd much prefer improvement in the core.”Coty stock has tanked 68.4% year-to-date and the average analyst price target of $4.54 indicates a recovery of about 28% from the current levels. The Street is sidelined about Coty. Two Buys, 7 Holds and no Sells add up to a Hold consensus.The Estée Lauder Companies (EL)Estée Lauder Companies, which owns popular brands like Estée Lauder, La Mer, Tom Ford, Clinique, M·A·C and Bobbi Brown, has fared better than its peers amid the pandemic due to its strong skincare business and digital presence.The company’s fiscal 4Q (ended Jun. 30) revenue declined 32% Y/Y to $2.43 billion as the temporary closure of stores, weak traffic after the gradual reopening of stores and work-from-home trend dragged down sales of the Makeup, Fragrance and Hare Care categories by 62%, 57% and 35%, respectively, while sales of the Skincare category grew 1%. Lower sales led to an adjusted loss per share of $0.53 in 4Q FY20 compared to adjusted EPS of $0.64 in 4Q FY19.Last year, Estée Lauder acquired Have & Be Co. Ltd., a South Korea-based skin care company that owns Dr. Jart+ skin care brand and men’s grooming brand Do The Right Thing. Excluding the impact of the Dr. Jart+ acquisition and currency headwinds, Estée Lauder expects its sales to decline in the range of 14% to 15% in 1Q FY21.Estée Lauder’s fiscal 1Q guidance reflects improved business trends and strong e-commerce sales. Organic e-commerce sales grew by almost triple digits in 4Q FY20. The company is significantly investing in its e-commerce business and aims to attract more customers by expanding its virtual try-on option to more categories and live-streaming events with make-up artists and brand ambassadors.Meanwhile, the company is focusing on growth prospects in Mainland China, where sales increased by about 60% in 4Q FY20. Indeed, Estée Lauder’s premium and luxury segments of skincare are seeing robust demand in the region. (See EL stock analysis on TipRanks)On Sept.28, Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English upgraded Estée Lauder to Hold from Sell and increased the price target to $231 from $147 on strength in the company’s China business. In a research note to investors, the analyst explained that although Estée Lauder could witness headwinds in the US, this weakness is likely to be offset by the expansion of its China business from 20% of the company’s consumption in 2019 to an estimated 40% in 2021.Estée Lauder stock has risen 8.7% year-to-date (as of Oct. 11) and the average analyst price target of $225.79 suggests that the stock is fully valued at the current levels. The Street is cautiously optimistic about Estée Lauder with a Moderate Buy consensus based on 10 Buys versus 3 Holds and 1 Sell.Bottom lineEstée Lauder has fared better than Coty amid the pandemic and is well-positioned to recover faster from the COVID-led slowdown. Coty is implementing several transformational measures but it might take a long time for the company to get back on the sales growth track.What's more, Estée Lauder scores a better Street consensus compared to Coty based on its operational performance and strong exposure to growth areas like e-commerce and key markets like China. Currently, the upside potential in Coty stock looks better than Estée Lauder. However, as indicated by the Street’s sentiment, Estée Lauder appears to be the better long-term investment.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-09-04	2020-09-04 16:37:24	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	The Effects Of COVID On The Beauty Industry	According to McKinsey Consulting, the beauty industry saw its sales halve on a year-over-year basis. McKinsey predicts global revenue will fall by up to 30% during 2020. But consumers are still buying beauty products and the industry is adapting to the COVID-19 era. Ironically, this industry is like a cockroach. It always figures out how to survive.In the early days of the pandemic, large corporations such as Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE: EL) and L OREAL S A/ADR (OTC: LRLCY) (OTC: LRLCF) shifted their production to hand sanitizers. By meeting the demand, they managed to keep their factories open. Luckily, it was easy for beauty companies to shift their production to sanitizers as alcohol is contained in the majority of their products. But the story goes far beyond sanitizers.Beauty In The COVID-Era These days, beauty companies sell sanitizers that smell and look much fancier than the regular edition of this simple hygienic tool. Sanitizers and masks became the new fashion statement. Some brands have even started infusing healthy additions like zinc into cloth masks to boost their value by claiming they have antimicrobial properties.No More Need For Makeup Beauty companies are astute at identifying a problem and trying to solve it. Sometimes, they even succeed in creating a need out of thin air. When the pandemic started, brands tried to convince women they need makeup for conference calls on Zoom Video Communications Inc's (NASDAQ: ZM) platform or meetings via Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Teams. But as the lockdown went on and on, we just got used to seeing imperfections as well as pets and kids running around. Zoom's beautify feature was an unbeatable blow as all users need to do is check the box named &quot;Touch Up My Appearance.&quot; Estee Lauder - The Image Of The Industry Estee Lauder's fourth-quarter earnings reported skincare sales were up by 1/4 while makeup sales more than halved. The rise in online sales was not enough to compensate for store closures as both revenues and profit dived. Estee Lauder revealed net profits more than halved to $680 million in the year to June. The fall came despite the group making $800 million worth of savings including cuts to advertising, travel and a recruitment freeze. June's quarterly dividend was not handed out. Estee Lauder will be trimming its global workforce by 2,000. The cuts are expected to save the company up to $400 million a year.Estee Lauder's latest earnings report does a good job at reflecting the overall industry. Even L'Oreal saw its sales dropping more than 11% during the first six months of the year.Masks Replaced Makeup With Inner Beauty Wellness NPD reported that prestige makeup has seen sales drop 37 percent in the last six months. Out of seventy-one percent of women in the firm's study said they wear makeup less often as a consequence of their new lifestyle. Women have become more concerned about inner beauty that radiates from the inside out. The famous lipstick index met its match, but companies found a way to put other products in consumer's minds and on even on their faces such as eye makeup, according to NPD's sales data.One of the reasons DIY treatments are popular now is that SPAs and salons were closed during the lockdown. Nail polish sales had been suffering before the pandemic but are now booming as women couldn't get their manicures done at salons.The New Buzzword Face masks will continue being part of our future for a while. Beauty loves a good buzzword to throw around, and this time that word is maskne. It describes the appearance of acne around the area where one wears a mask. This is not a new term as it is simply derived from basic inflammation and irritation caused by physical friction. The humidity and dirt inside the mask can only worsen the underlying condition as they create an ideal environment for bacteria to thrive.From Lipstick To Skincare The &quot;lipstick index,&quot; a term coined by Leonard Lauder, didn't hold this time. NPD reported that lipstick sales tanked over the last six months when masks became the known way to fight the spread of COVID. Skincare replaced it. But there's no reason to think that beauty won't surf the wave like it did during the recession in 2008 because the fundamental factor didn't change. People are eager to splurge on small luxuries to help themselves feel better both physically and mentally during these unprecedented times.But it seems makeup sales will continue being soft for the foreseeable future. The pandemic brought long-term changes in consumer behavior. Consumers are still buying beauty products, but their priorities changed, as well as the way they value brands. COVID-19 redefined the look of the beauty industry. This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

Estee Lauder Wins Over Another Analyst: Why RBC Is Turning Bullish	Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE: EL) won over another Street analyst Monday, as RBC Capital Markets sees the beauty company as being run by one of the best management teams.The Estee Lauder Analyst: Nik Modi upgraded Estee Lauder from Sector Perform to Outperform with a price target lifted from $194 to $240.The Estee Lauder Takeaways: Estee Lauder's stock has lagged major indices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The fourth-quarter the company issued Thursday prompted RBC to turn bullish for five reasons, Modi said in a Monday upgrade note. (See his track record here.)First, the pandemic accelerated a favorable trend of consumers shopping online for beauty products, the analyst said. Online sales come with more favorable margins versus department stores and offer better customer data, he said. Second, Estee Lauder has shown an ability to &quot;weather the storm and bounce back&quot; from prior difficulties, Modi said, adding that the stock fell 50% during the global financial crisis, only to gain nearly 200% on the rebound. Third, the company deserves credit for cutting operating expenses by 22% in the fourth quarter, and some of these cuts will remain permanent, the analyst said. This should help Estee Lauder return to pre-pandemic margins of 17.5% by fiscal 2022, with further expansion in outer years, he said. Fourth, Estee Lauder's recent track record of success includes a shift to online sales, a focus on fast-growing skincare, growth in Asia and generating margin expansion year-over-year for each of the past five years prior to the pandemic, Modi said.This &quot;lends credibility&quot; to its ability to execute on its business acceleration program, the analyst said. Estee Lauder's long-term growth profile of 6% to 8% remains &quot;achievable&quot; from a combination of inorganic growth and strong organic growth, according to RBC. EL Price Action: Shares of Estee Lauder were trading higher by 3.96% at the time of publication Monday at $215.20.

2020-08-24	2020-08-24 09:36:17	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	Morgan Stanley Upgrades Estee Lauder To Buy, Hikes PT	Morgan Stanley upgraded Estee Lauder to Buy from Hold, citing the switch to e-commerce and &quot;skin care momentum&quot; as the main drivers fueling growth recovery in the long-term.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian, who raised the stock's price target to $233 (12.6% upside potential) from $196, sees &quot;key value drivers as still intact longterm post COVID, particularly skin care momentum and a shift to e-commerce, and more COVID challenged areas as likely to recover, with new H2 FY21 EPS guidance and LT margin guidance from EL's fiscal Q4 call providing more visibility.&quot; The analyst believes that Estee Lauder is still on track in its years-long transformation into a “higher growth and higher margin company&quot;.Despite EL’s disappointing 4Q results on Aug. 20, many analysts turned bullish on the company's long-term outlook. D.A. Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser upgraded the EL to Buy from Hold and lifted the price target to $231 (11.6% upside potential) from $183 on Aug. 21.Bolton Weiser noted that “Estee Lauder had enough confidence and visibility to issue first-quarter guidance,” which minimizes the risk of earnings disappointments in the future. The analyst expects e-commerce revenues to continue to grow in fiscal 2021.Estee Lauder reported a loss of $0.50 a share in 4Q, versus analysts’ expectations of a loss of $0.19 per share. Its revenues of $2.43 billion missed Street expectations of $2.45 billion, due to store closures amid the coronavirus pandemic. Nevertheless, the company is positive about a COVID-19 recovery across all the regions, led by China, and expects sales trends to improve sequentially each quarter in fiscal 2021. For 1Q, EL expects its earnings in the range of $0.80 - $0.85 per share. (See EL stock analysis on TipRanks).Currently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 10 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average price target of $218.21 implies upside potential of 5.4%, with its shares trading almost flat on a year-to-date basis.Related News:  GAN Drops 18% On Larger 2Q Loss; Analyst Sticks To Buy  Deere Gains 4% On Raised 2020 Profit Outlook  Pinduoduo Sinks 14% After 2Q Revenues Miss Estimates More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * AstraZeneca Rises On Report Trump Could Fast-Track Covid-19 Vaccine Candidate   * Takeda To Sell Consumer Health Unit To Blackstone In $2.3B Deal   * Sonnet Bio Spikes 70% In Pre-Market On FDA Covid-19 Plasma Nod   * KBR Scores Double China Contract Win For Baofeng Energy Project	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-upgrades-estee-lauder-093617687.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-21	2020-08-21 19:20:42	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	2 Estee Lauder Analysts Issue Upgrades After Q4 Miss: 'It Makes Sense To Look Longer-Term'	Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE: EL) reported fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2020 results Thursday that disappointed investors -- prompted two analysts to turn bullish on the beauty stock. The Estee Lauder Analysts: D.A. Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser upgraded Estee Lauder from Neutral to Buy with a price target lifted $183 to $231.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian upgraded Estee Lauder from Equal-weight to Overweight with a price target lifted from $196 to $233.DA Davidson Says The Worst Is Over: Estee Lauder reported &quot;worse-than-feared&quot; fourth-quarter results, Bolton Weiser said in a note. The cosmetics company posted a constant currency fourth-quarter loss of 50 cents per share against a Street estimate for a 19-cent-per-share loss, and sales of $2.43 billion missed the $2.45-billion Street estimate. The operating loss of $228 million was also worse than the $93-million loss the Street was expecting, the analyst said, adding that the gross margin fell 840 basis points year-over-year to 68.5% against expectations for a 72.3% gross margin. Estee Lauder's guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2021 was also disappointing, she said. The company expects to earn 80-85 cents per share on revenue in a range of $3.389 billion to $3.428 billion versus expectations of $1.15 on revenue of $3.491 billion, Bolton Weiser said. The reason to be bullish moving forward is that Estee Lauder's guidance lowers the risk of earnings disappointments, the analyst said. The gross margin should move higher going forward, as manufacturing capacity is running at near-normal levels, the analyst said.View more earnings on ELE-commerce as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter was around 40%, and the margin-accretive online business should grow in China and the U.S., she said. Estee Lauder is prioritizing its e-commerce business, including reinvesting cost savings in digital capabilities and omnichannel, according to D.A. Davidson. Morgan Stanley Says It's Not Looking Back: Estee Lauder's fourth-quarter report and guidance were &quot;disappointing&quot; and warranted the 7% decline in the stock, Mohsenian said in an upgrade note.Now is not the time to look in the rearview mirror, as the company highlighted multiple growth drivers, the analyst said. The prior bullish case was based on Estee Lauder's moves over the last 10 years to focus on high-growth, high-margin categories like skin care, e-commerce, travel retail and the Chinese market, he said.In the long run, this is a valid thesis and it &quot;remains on track,&quot; Mohsenian said. &quot;Net, with vaccine progress on the horizon, and the S&P 500 at an all-time high, we think it makes sense to look out longer-term at EL.&quot; EL Price Action: Estee Lauder shares were up 4.63% at $207.45 at last check Friday.

Estee Lauder shares fall after wider-than-expected losses	Estee Lauder Cos.  stock fell 5.3% in Thursday premarket trading after the beauty company reported fiscal fourth-quarter losses that were wider than expected and gave weak guidance. Net losses totaled $462 million, or $1.28 per share, after net income of $157 million, or 43 cents per share, last year. Adjusted losses were 53 cents per share, well below the 16-cents-per-share loss FactSet forecast. Sales of $2.43 billion were down from $3.59 billion last year and missed the $2.45 billion FactSet consensus. Office closures, the lack of parties and other gatherings and store closures due to COVID-19 have impacted the company, though Estee Lauder says the haircare and skincare side of the business has been &quot;more resilient.&quot; Skin care was up 13% to $7.38 billion for the year, while all other business categories declined. And the Asia/Pacific region was up 15% for the year to $4.24 billion while the Americas and EMEA fell. The company has repaid the money it borrowed under its credit facilities in two installments of $750 million each in June and August. It has declared a dividend of 48 cents per share, payable on September 15 to stockholders of record as of August 31. Estee Lauder announced a post-COVID-19 Business Acceleration Program that will include closing stores across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa while ramping up digital investment; a &quot;realignment&quot; of the distribution network to reflect department store closures, shuttering unproductive beauty counters and its own store closures; and a headcount reduction of 1,500 to 2,000 workers, about 3% of the workforce, around the world, primarily store associates and support staff. The company plans to close 10% to 15% of all its locations internationally. Estee Lauder expects to take a restructuring charge between $400 million and $500 million before taxes. For the fiscal first quarter, Estee Lauder expects net sales to decrease by 12% to 13% year-over-year, EPS between 77 cents and 83 cents and adjusted EPS between 80 cents and 85 cents. The FactSet consensus is for sales of $3.45 billion, which suggests an 11.4% year-over-year decline, and EPS of $1.26. Estee Lauder stock has gained nearly 3% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index  is up 4.5% for the period.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e8d077e4-889b-3925-944a-dc37275df280/estee-lauder-shares-fall.html?.tsrc=rss

Oppenheimer Names Beauty Company Estee Lauder A 'Top Pick'	Oppenheimer's case against owning shares of Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE: EL) was based on COVID-19 related headwinds but this stance can no longer be justified.The Analyst: Rupesh Parikh upgraded Estee Lauder's stock from Perform to Outperform with a price target lifted from $160 to $240. The beauty stock is also named as a &quot;top pick&quot; at Oppenheimer.The Thesis: Oppenheimer downgraded Estee Lauder's stock in late January due to &quot;severe&quot; near-term COVID-19 concerns, Parikh wrote in the note. However, it's now evident this stance underestimated the severity of the pandemic along with a potential recovery timeline.In fact, the beauty category recovery is recovering faster than expected. L'Oreal said in a company presentation sales were down 34.3% in April and improved to down 19.1% in May and down just 4.6% in June. Shiseido similarly noted in a presentation sales trends bottomed in April and May.Specific to L'Oreal, management confirmed in late July it is now seeing growth. The company said: &quot;July that we are closing today will be the first positive month in terms of growth again since January.&quot;L'Oreal's management said at an analyst day presentation it is starting to see a recovery in China and expects a double-digit sales growth rate in the fourth quarter and beyond. Naturally, the important market growing at a double-digit rate is a &quot;big positive&quot; to the stock story.Price Action: Shares of Estee Lauder were trading higher by 1% at $213.52.Related Links:BofA Says Ulta Beauty 'Well-Positioned' For Life After CoronavirusBeauty Sector Looks Promising Amid COVID-19Latest Ratings for EL  DateFirmActionFromTo  Aug 2020OppenheimerUpgradesPerformOutperform  Aug 2020StifelMaintainsBuy  Jun 2020Credit SuisseMaintainsOutperform    View More Analyst Ratings for EL   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Need To Follow Tesla, Apple's Lead And Split  * Uber Vs.

2020-07-15	2020-07-15 18:38:33	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	3 Cosmetics Stocks to Freshen Up Your Holdings	In the past few months, our lives have mostly centered around our homes. Many consumers have initially limited shopping to basic consumer essentials, such as food and hygiene products. As economies begin to open up around the world, consumer discretionary products, such as cosmetics, are likely to go back on shopping lists. Therefore, today I'll discuss three cosmetics stocks to freshen up your holdings.The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics by as &quot;articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body … for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.&quot; Different countries have similar legal definitions that also highlight intended use. Most consumers may regard cosmetics as a substance that is applied to the human body, including the face, to enhance its appearance or odor.Main products within the cosmetics industry include makeup, perfume, hair care, skincare, oral cosmetics and toiletries. Skin care is the leading category, accounting for about 39% of the global market. It is followed by hair care products (21% and make-up (19%). Luxury skin care is regarded as one of the most profitable parts of the industry.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTherefore, as the &quot;new normal&quot; life begins globally, it may be safe to assume that consumers will not hesitate to spend more to care for their faces and bodies. The global cosmetics market is expected to reach &quot;$429.8 billion by 2022, registering a CAGR of 4.3% during the forecast period 2016-2022.&quot;It is a highly concentrated industry, dominated mostly by several multinationals. At present, there is no single benchmark for the cosmetics industry. Therefore if you are interested in the general industry, you may also want to keep an eye on the the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLY).  * 8 Presidential Election Stocks to Buy in Case Trump Wins AgainBeauty may be in the eye of the beholder. And with timely research and due diligence, investors may find that robust cosmetics companies can put beauty in their portfolio. Therefore today, we look at three cosmetics stocks to freshen up your holdings. They are:  * e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF)  * Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL)  * L'Oreal SA (OTCMKTS:LRLCY) Cosmetics stocks: e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) Source: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com California-based e.l.f. Beauty specializes in manufacturing and selling &quot;100% vegan and cruelty-free&quot; skin care and makeup products. The product range includes eyeliners, lipstick, lip glosses, blushes, brushes, bronzers and mascara. The name e.l.f. stands for eyes, lips and face. The business was established in 2004, making it a relatively newcomer in the industry. It went public late 2016 at an opening price of $24. Products are sold both online and in retail channels, such as Target (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA).Its sales steadily increased, in part due to prices that seem to be affordable for a wide range of consumers. In late March, the group released its fourth-quarter and FY 2020 results. Over the fiscal year, it recorded &quot;four quarters of net sales growth, culminating in a 16% increase in the fourth quarter versus prior year.&quot;For the full year, net sales increased 6% to $282.9 million, as compared to $267.7 million in fiscal 2019. Gross margin also increased to 64% from 61%. And for Q4, net sales increased 13% to $74.7 million as compared to $66.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019. It had $46.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.Due to the novel coronavirus, the company saw a marked decline in retail sales. However, that loss was partially offset by increased online sales. So far in 2020, ELF stock is up over 20%, which means the shares are in a bull market. In fact, they hit a 52-week high on July 9.If you're looking for robust cosmetics stocks to freshen up your portfolio, e.l.f. shares deserve to be among the top names. Estee Lauder (EL)Source: Shutterstock New York City-based Estee Lauder is a multinational manufacturer of skin care, makeup, and hair care products as well as fragrances. The group started operations in 1946 under the leadership of Mrs. Estee Lauder, who developed her own line of beauty products. Now its portfolio includes Aramis, Aveda, Bobby Brown, Clinique, Darphin, Ermenegildo Zegna, Estee Lauder, Jo Malone, La Mer, Mac, Michael Kors, Origins and Tommy Hilfiger. These brand names provide a large economic moat.In terms of geographic distribution of products, Europe, Middle East and Africa bring in over 43% of revenue. The Americas contribute over 31%. And the Asia-Pacific region brings in around 25% of total revenue.On May 1, the group released released FY 2020 third quarter results.  Net sales were $3.35 billion, a decrease of 11% from $3.74 billion in the prior-year period. And the company reported a net loss of $6 million, compared with net earnings of $555 million last year.The company attributed these losses to the closure of stores due to Covid-19. Yet CEO Fabrizio Freda optimistically highlighted, &quot;The surge in our online business worldwide, coupled with the recovery we are seeing emerge in China, confirm consumers' passion for our prestige beauty portfolio.&quot;  * 8 Presidential Election Stocks to Buy in Case Trump Wins AgainManagement also said demand for skin care and hair care products has been more resilient than makeup and fragrance products. Year-to-date, EL stock is down close to 10%. Long-term investors may consider researching the the stock further. It will deserve to be on your radar as a cosmetic stock to own, especially if there is a decline toward $175. L'Oreal SA (LRLCY) Source: Shutterstock L'Oreal is a French conglomerate specializing in personal care products, including hair dyes, skin care products, makeup tools and items, and fragrances. It is the world's largest cosmetics company.It operates under four main divisions:  * Professional Products (including L'Oreal, Redken, and Kerastese);  * Consumer Products (including L'Oreal, Garnier, Maybelline and Niely);  * L'Oreal Luxe (including Lancome, YvesSaintLaurent, Biotherm, Ralph Lauren, Diesel and Valentino);  * Active Cosmetics. (including Vichy, Decleor and SkinCeuticals).In recent weeks, it has agreed to buy Thayers Natural Remedies, a Connecticut-based natural skin care company whose history goes back 170 years. It will be added to the consumer products division. The company also regularly partners with other cosmetics and fashion firms to create exclusive product lines.L'Oreal released sales results for Q1 2020 in mid-April. Quarterly sales hit 7.22 billion euros, registering a 4.8% decline  YoY on a like-for-like basis. Management said the global cosmetics market experienced a sales decline of 8% in the first quarter of 2020.Despite the global decline, L'Oreal sales in China were up 6.4%. The adverse effect of Covid-19 was different for each segment.&quot;The L'Oreal Luxe and Professional Products Divisions are the most impacted due to the closure of perfumeries, department stores and hair salons in many countries,&quot; CEO Jean-Paul Agon said. &quot;The Consumer Products Division however has seen a more moderate decline, largely because the activity in mass-market retail has been maintained. Lastly, the Active Cosmetics Division is still posting double-digit growth, with the pharmacy channel still open, and a portfolio of brands that is adapted to the strong demand for health-related products.&quot;Year to date, LRLCY stock is up more than 9%. I would look to buy the dips in this global leader of cosmetics stocks, especially if the price goes toward $60.Tezcan Gecgil has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, including a Ph.D. degree, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

2020-06-12	2020-06-12 09:00:31	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	Ronald Lauder Shouldn’t Be Fired for Backing Trump	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Ronald S. Lauder, the younger of Estee Lauder’s two sons, has been working for his late mother’s eponymous company since 1964. At 76, he’s still there — presiding over the Clinique brand and serving as a director. He owns around 7% of the stock, most of which are Class B shares that give him and his family 87% of the voting power. He has also been an official in the Defense Department, the ambassador to Austria, the president of the World Jewish Congress, and a leading art collector and philanthropist.And one other thing: Lauder is a Republican. More than that, he’s a Donald Trump Republican, having poured $1.6 million into “pro-Trump organizations” since 2016, according to Bloomberg News. Last week, amid the swirl of protests after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, something took place at Estee Lauder Cos. that was both astonishing and troubling: About 100 employees sent a letter to the chairman, William Lauder, who is also Ronald Lauder’s nephew. They demanded that his uncle be removed from the board.“Ronald Lauder’s involvement with the Estee Lauder Companies is damaging to our corporate values, our relationship with the Black community, our relationship with this company’s Black employees, and this company’s legacy,” the letter said.The company responded with a vow to donate $1 million to advocate for “social, economic and racial justice,” and a promise to “speed up a review of its policies with a commitment to tackle racial justice.” As part of its statement, it also rejected Ronald Lauder’s politics:This week, several employees asked whether a single member of the Lauder family and our board, represents the views of our company. The answer is no.Not good enough, the employees replied. They came back with a demand that Estee Lauder commit $5 million instead of $1 million. They also sent around a petition that read, in part, “This [$1 million] total does not match, or exceed Ronald Lauder’s personal donations in support of state-sanctioned violence.” So far, 5,000 employees have signed the petition.To judge by the statistics Estee Lauder has posted on social media, its record of hiring and promoting black employees is better than most. (The company says that 12% of its employees and 14% of its executive officers are black, and that 19% of its directors are people of color.) But none of this matters to the employees who are objecting to Ronald Lauder. He is a Trump supporter, and that’s enough in their view: He has to go.This notion of employee revolt has been a recent development. Sure, there have been strikes, but that’s different from employees rising up against their employers for political or social reasons rather than financial ones. The push for companies to tackle climate change has come largely from outside groups, not employees. And when board members are pressured to resign, it’s usually because of poor performance, not politics, with shareholder activists leading the charge. Employees wouldn’t dare, at least not before now.So why now? There are two reasons, I think, one obvious and one not so obvious. The obvious one is that the U.S. has a president who says and does things that are simply beyond the pale — things that no one could ever imagine a previous president saying or doing: separating immigrant children from their parents; stating that the white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville were “very fine people”; and, most recently, having the police forcibly remove peaceful protesters so he could stage a photo op holding a Bible outside St. John’s Church in Washington. The list is long, and he adds to it almost every day.Many employees, especially younger ones, are repulsed at the idea that their company might be aiding and abetting this awful man. And they’re not willing to look the other way. Remember how, just weeks after Trump was inaugurated, an internal revolt at Uber forced Travis Kalanick, the chief executive at the time, to quit a Trump economic advisory council?It’s happened again and again. David Remnick, the editor of the New Yorker, had to disinvite Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, from the New Yorker Festival after a huge outcry from readers, other invited speakers — and the magazine’s staff. Facebook parted ways with a top executive, Palmer Luckey, because his support of Trump “sparked a backlash among his colleagues,” as the Wall Street Journal put it. (Facebook has denied any connection.) Trump supporter Robert Mercer stepped down from his position as co-chief executive officer of Renaissance Technologies, the quant hedge fund founded by James Simons, because of internal dissent.The not-so-obvious reason has to do with the culture of millennials, who make up a large proportion of these new employee activists. Charlotte Alter, the author of “The Ones We’ve Been Waiting For,” a recent book about millennials, points out that her generation has spent most of their careers in the gig economy:They are less likely to have the protection of unions … less likely to have a set nine-to-five schedule … and less likely to stay at one company for long enough to build a track record of good work.In other words, if their activism costs them their job, they’ll shrug and move on.Alter also has an interesting theory about how millennials developed their values. Boomer parents, she says, were overprotective, which in turn caused schools to become overprotective — “imposing predetermined draconian punishments on even minor childhood misbehavior, such as pushing other kids on the playground or calling names.” She adds:Millennials were raised in a system where even a little misbehavior could get you suspended, expelled, or even imprisoned. Is it any surprise that these kids grew up to impose strict social codes on each other and themselves? The kids who grew up under zero tolerance policies for playground name-calling are the same ones who now “cancel” each other for bad jokes.She concludes, “There is a direct line between zero tolerance school behavior policies and the sometimes merciless nature of millennial morality, in which anyone who violates the social code risks total ostracism for even a minor misstep.”Like, for instance, Ronald Lauder.There is no question that the pressure placed on Estee Lauder by its employees has had a positive effect. On Wednesday, in their latest effort to defuse the situation, William Lauder and CEO Fabrizio Freda sent a memo to the staff. It included a long list of promises, among them a vow to donate $10 million to the NAACP and other groups and to focus on diversity at every level of the company. What they did not do was promise to remove Ronald Lauder from the board.Nor should they — not only because he is a highly competent member of the founding family but also because everyone should be entitled to their own politics without fear of retribution.What Estee Lauder needs to do now is say, unapologetically, that Ronald Lauder will remain on the board. If some employees quit as a result, so be it. But just as young employees across the country have helped raise important issues and highlighted important values, there is one value that companies need to defend: tolerance for people who don’t think the way they do.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

The company swung to a loss of $6 million, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter, after earnings of $555 million, or $1.51 a share, in the year-earlier period.

2019-11-17	2019-11-17 10:44:57	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	3 Monster Growth Stocks That Can Move Even Higher	One thing is clear: investors are constantly searching for serious growth names. These aren’t any old stocks with blink-and-you’ll-miss-it growth narratives. We’re talking about stocks in it for the long-haul, poised to climb higher and deliver returns in the years to come. For investors that have settled on this strategy, what’s the best way to find these tickers with growth prospects that go above and beyond? Our suggestion: make use of TipRanks. The platform’s Stock Screener tool simplified our research process by allowing us to filter our search results by analyst consensus and upside potential from the current share price. To this end, we were able to pinpoint 3 stocks primed for substantial long-term gains.With this in mind, let’s get started.Equinix, Inc. (EQIX) Equinix is best-known for being the world’s largest data center and colocation provider, with its products enabling speedy application performance and low latency. On the heels of its third quarter earnings, several members of the Street are backing EQIX, which is already up 56% year-to-date.To kick off the release, the company reported that gross bookings were the highest ever for a third quarter and the second-highest overall. Not to mention EQIX is ahead of its competitors as it boasts 356,000 customer cross-connections, which includes 20,000 virtual connections. If that wasn’t enough, EQIX’s hybrid cloud growth is accelerating due to its recent shift to cloud trends. This resulted in the enterprise segment making up 60% of bookings.Oppenheimer’s Timothy Horan also points out that while there had been some concern regarding the recently announced Digital Realty (DLR) and InterXion (INXN) merger, it makes EQIX “well-positioned as the only pure-play interconnectivity focused data center”. He notes that as its competitors undergo a complicated integration, there will be a window to take market share.  All of this prompted the five-star analyst to not only keep a Buy rating but also to bump up the price target to $650. At this new target, shares could rise 18% over the next twelve months. (To watch Horan’s track record, click here)      Similarly, other Wall Street analysts take a bullish approach when it comes to EQIX. 12 Buys and 1 Hold assigned in the last three months give it a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus. Its $611 average price target indicates 11% upside potential. (See Equinix stock analysis on TipRanks) ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW)  Originally an IT service automation tool, ServiceNow has become one of the top providers of cloud-based solutions that tracks service issues within businesses as they come up. With shares moving 46% higher year-to-date, Wall Street has its eyes on NOW.Despite facing foreign exchange (FX) headwinds, the company posted a beat in terms of EPS, subscription billings as well as subscription revenue, which is up 33% year-over-year. Its guidance for fiscal Q4 2019 was also generally better than analysts expected.   Most notably, management addressed the misinformation circling around the Street. Incoming CEO Bill McDermott tells investors that the current situation is much brighter than some may think, citing its “pristine” platform and “amazing” organic growth story. Its CFO search is in fact coming to a conclusion, with a decision expected soon. There also hasn’t been a change to employee attribution rates as 97 out of the top 100 sales staff are staying put. This helped reaffirm Macquarie analyst Sarah Hindlian’s conclusion that NOW is still a Buy. “We are highly confident in ServiceNow’s global strategic positioning and believe an opportunity for entry exists,” she commented. As a result, the four-star analyst attached an increased price target of $336 to her bullish call. This updated target conveys her confidence in NOW’s ability to jump 29% in the next twelve months. (To watch Hindlian’s track record, click here)  Like Hindlian, the rest of the Street is impressed. NOW is a ‘Strong Buy’ based on the 18 Buy ratings and 2 Holds issued in the last three months. In addition, its $229 average price target brings the upside potential to 15%. (See ServiceNow stock analysis on TipRanks) The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL)The global makeup and beauty name has taken some heat recently thanks to a fiscal 2020 outlook reset. That being said, one analyst believes that EL’s growth narrative remains strong, with further gains on top of its already achieved 47% year-to-date growth expected.Part of the concern is related to EL’s 100 basis point reduction in its guidance for global beauty market growth as a whole. This has been blamed on U.S. makeup weakness, as well as some deceleration in China and the travel retail space. However, Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein argues that EL has a lot more going for it than the Street realizes. “China actually accelerated (as did the broader Asia-Pacific corridor) supporting the view argued in our initiation, that growth from China will remain stronger for longer than investors appreciate,” he explained.Ottenstein adds that foundation, or makeup applied to the skin for a more natural look, drove the 4% net makeup sales increase, with skincare sales also ramping up. This is important as skincare margins are 4x higher than makeup and foundations maintain the highest consumer loyalty compared to all other types of makeup. Bearing this in mind, the analyst reiterated his bullish call and $230 price target, suggesting shares could surge 20% over the next twelve month period. (To watch Ottenstein’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, 8 Buy ratings vs 3 Holds add up to a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus. On top of this, its $218 average price target puts the potential twelve-month gain at 14%.

But one place it does grow is on well-placed investments that generate strong, stable, recurring streams of revenue. Buy the right stock at the right time and you’ll reap the rewards. And one of the best times to do so, is just before the holiday season.“But what about the trade wars with China and the declining stability in the US economy”, you ask? Regardless of the current economic uncertainty, consumers are already out there shopping and filling up their baskets with new gifts before time runs out. These same consumers are also light on the trigger when it comes to online shopping, now more than ever.And the numbers don’t lie. According to a study performed by the National Retail Federation, 33% of American consumers are expected to spend a minimum of $1000 on gifts this holiday season, with the remaining 66% expected to spend between $100-$999 on gifts.With this in mind, we’ve gathered the most attractive investments based on overall analyst consensus and narrowed down the list for you by using the TipRanks' stock screener. Investors can use the screener to filter stocks by analyst consensus, upside potential, market cap, and etc.Let's take a closer look at two consumer stocks to fill your own holiday baskets with:Alibaba Stock Remains a Top PickE-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) is what many believe to be the ‘heavyweight champion’ of the consumer goods space. Even after the recent departure of the company’s co-founder and executive chairman Jack Ma, Alibaba continues to stand strong and is showing no signs of a future slow-down. BABA has grown 24% year-to-date, with analysts predicting the stock to continue outperform the broad market.After visiting the Alibaba Investor Day in September, 5-star Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler reiterated a bullish ‘strong buy’ rating on the stock. (To watch Kessler's track record, click here)&quot;Alibaba remains our top Internet mega-cap pick given [that] we expect continued solid China e-commerce growth with Alibaba as the biggest winner at a 60% market share.” Kessler stated. “We believe take rate upside is underappreciated and that the valuation is attractive with 20%+ expected long-term growth.&quot;Echoing and confirming Kessler's bullish thoughts, 5-star Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt added, &quot;We are encouraged by Alibaba’s continued expansion of consumer and enterprise services, steady market share gains, and a long-term investment focus on cloud, international, local services, offline retail, and innovation. Alibaba remains one of our favorite large cap ideas and is a Select List pick. Alibaba has runway to expand market leadership, user penetration, and synergies across businesses.&quot; Devitt rates BABA stock a Buy, with $225 price target.All in all, this 'Strong Buy' stock is no Wall Street secret. After all, in just three months, the stock has attracted 15 'buy' ratings. With a return potential of 32%, the stock's consensus price target stands at $223.50. In other words, optimism backs this Chinese e-commerce titan. Analysts are keen on BABA stock and you should definitely take notice. (See BABA's price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks)The Beauty of Estée Lauder StockFor many women (and some men) around the world, the Estée Lauder (EL) brand needs no introduction. Consumers worldwide have been enjoying the offerings of one of the world’s leading manufacturers and marketers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products for the past 73 years.It’s not surprising that the bulls are focusing on EL heading into the pivotal holiday shopping season, sending the stock rising about 50% year-to-date.EL ended its fiscal year 2019 with a bang, posting tremendous growth outlook. Specifically, the company delivered a high quality 4Q EPS beat ($0.64 vs. Street $0.53) -- and more importantly -- Q4 strength is set to continue in Q1.“We argue that the outlook for Q1 F20 sales, more than the magnitude of Q4 earnings beat, best indicates EL’s 2020 earnings power and reflects mgmt. assessment of the return on its reinvestments to prolong 1) Asia’s momentum; 2) stabilize and turnaround the U.S. business,”, Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein opined. With his bullish thesis reaffirmed, Ottenstein reiterated a ‘buy’ rating on EL stock, along with a $230 price target.All in all, Wall Street’s confidence backing this beauty giant is strong, with TipRanks analytics showcasing EL as a Strong Buy. Based on 7 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 6 rate the stock a Buy while only one suggests Hold. Meanwhile, the 12-month average price target stands at $215.17, marking a nearly 11% upside from where the stock is currently trading.

Estée Lauder brands include La Mer, the namesake brand, and MAC, which all grew in the most recent quarter. Geographically, China was strong. &quot;Notably, the tensions in Hong Kong, ~4% of sales, have not had a significant effect on Estée Lauder's business,&quot; analysts wrote. &quot;Management noted that it is working to recover part of the tourist revenue in other markets and to reach those consumers online, as well as reaching the local consumer through target marketing and product innovation.&quot; Stifel rates Estée Lauder stock buy with a $210 price target, up from $205. Raymond James also raised its price target, to $216 from $181. Analysts there rate Estée Lauder stock outperform. And Wells Fargo lifted its price target to $190 from $175, with a market perform stock rating. Estée Lauder stock has gained 55.4% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index  is up 16.6% for the period.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b406fe39-1b4f-3c2e-9461-0933f638d27a/here%26%2339%3Bs-why-analysts-think.html?.tsrc=rss

North America Luxury Stocks Drop as Hong Kong Protests Mount	(Bloomberg) -- Tiffany & Co., Estee Lauder Cos., Movado Group Inc. and other North America luxury-goods stocks sank after protests in Hong Kong escalated and all flights at the region’s airport were canceled.Hong Kong is a major market for expensive consumer products, and the protests, which which have continued for 10 straight weekends, are disrupting retail businesses, travel, and gaming.An index of North America luxury goods has fallen nearly 30% since late April, when protests began over a -- now shelved -- extradition bill. That compares to a drop of about 1.6% for the S&P 500 Index over the same period. The group has also been battered by the continued back-and-forth of the U.S.-China trade war.The Bloomberg North America Luxury Goods Index (BIUSLGCP) fell as much as 3.6% on Monday, extending Friday’s 3.7% drop. Top decliners in the index include Fossil Group Inc., Tapestry Inc. and Capri Holdings Ltd. Non-index member Signet Jewelers Ltd. plunged as much as 12%. Earlier, European luxury names including LVMH, Richemont and Burberry fell on bourses in Paris, London, Frankfurt, Zurich and Copenhagen.(Updates to add individual stock moves in the last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Janet Freund in New York at jfreund11@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Morwenna ConiamFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/north-america-luxury-stocks-drop-164442381.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-07	2019-08-07 20:15:04	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	Want to Hire Millennials? Better Help Repay Student Debt	(Bloomberg) -- Like millions of her peers, Nicole Read graduated with thousands of dollars of debt. Unlike most of them, she’s getting direct help from her employer to pay it back.The 26-year-old’s job at event organizer Live Nation Entertainment in Beverly Hills, California, comes with a benefit that may be starting to catch on at U.S. companies: Contributions to her student loan bills. Offering such an incentive helps businesses lure prospective employees as they grapple with tight labor market conditions marked by a jobless rate near its lowest in almost five decades.In Read’s case, it’s $100 a month. As a result, “I’m paying like $30 over my minimum payment every month, so it’s gotten me to pay off my interest a little quicker,” she said. “It just kind of gives me a bit of breathing room.”Such plans are spreading. They were on offer to staff at about 8% of U.S. employers in 2019, more than double the 2015 level, according to an April survey by the Society for Human Resource Management.Another study by business adviser Willis Towers Watson found that 32% of firms are considering introducing a similar benefit by 2021.“If you have a young demographic, offering benefits like student loan repayment could be the way to go,” said Alex Alonso, chief knowledge officer for SHRM.Pronounced competition for talent and the elevated debt burden for a generation of Americans making their way into the workforce are driving the change. Millennials make up more than half of Live Nation’s U.S. labor force.The balance on outstanding student loans reached $1.6 trillion at the end of the first quarter, and more than a quarter of that is held by people younger than 30. The effects reverberate through their social and economic lives, making it harder to start a family, buy a home or purchase big-ticket items, research shows.The federal government is considering giving companies a break for helping employees with their debt.The Employer Participation in Repayment Act, introduced in the House and Senate in February, would provide tax relief to firms that do so. It has bipartisan sponsors, including Democratic presidential candidates Seth Moulton and Amy Klobuchar.Other Democratic contenders, like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have proposed more sweeping fixes that include writing off loans.’Win-Win’“Helping employees get out of debt faster is a win-win, both for the employee and for our productivity,” said Katie Wandtke, director of human resources at Cybrary, a cyber-security firm based in College Park, Maryland.It’s not just smaller shops adopting the benefit. Larger companies, including professional services powerhouse PricewaterhouseCoopers, are catching on too.Live Nation began offering the benefit in early 2017 and has helped employees save over $4 million. More than 80 of the company’s workers have been able to completely pay off their loans, according to Live Nation.The event organizer works with startup Tuition.io, which specializes in helping companies set up such programs and has clients including Estee Lauder Cos. and Staples Inc. There are other platforms in the market too, including Goodly, which works with Cybrary, and Gradifi, used by PwC since 2016.Paying an extra $30 a month more than the minimum, like Read says she does with her employer’s help, makes a difference.For example, for a 10-year loan of $50,000 at 5%, it would save close to $1,000 in interest payments over the life of the loan – allowing the borrower to clear the slate eight months early.“Jobs in the entertainment industry like this one, they’re not high-paying jobs necessarily,” said Read. “So this kind of helps offset that wage difference and it’s really helpful for people like me.”(Updates with Tuition.to client in 15th paragraph.

That's because traveling was neither easy nor fun, whether by plane, train or automobile.As the weather improves, Americans will start to make travel plans for the summer ahead - and that should educate investors as they hunt down stocks to buy amid this bull run.Summer is the Super Bowl of air travel. Last year, trade association Airlines for America estimated that 246 million people would travel by air between June 1 and Aug. 3 of 2018. Turns out, that was a great estimate. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), 253 million people traveled by air between the Wednesday before Memorial Day (May 23) and the Tuesday after Labor Day (Sept. 4).Industry statistics also suggest that the amount of air travel is on the rise - a trend investors can benefit from if they know where to look. The problem is there's no good fund that covers the gamut of industries that contribute to commercial aviation. It's not just airlines and aircraft manufacturers - airport operators, hospitality businesses, construction firms, retailers, car rentals, even cosmetics companies, benefit directly or indirectly from more crowded skies.Here are seven stocks to buy that benefit from healthy air travel, several of which tend to fly under many investors' radars.

2019-03-22	2019-03-22 18:04:43	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	7 Dual-Class Stocks That Will Outperform	Dual-class stocks to buy are in the news again. Lyft, the ride-hailing app, is looking to go public. On March 18, the company filed an amended preliminary prospectus with the SEC that suggests it will offer almost 31 million of its Class A shares between $62 and $68 a share, valuing it at $23 billion or more.It's very popular with investors, already oversubscribed with a week left until it officially starts trading. People can't get enough of Lyft stock. However, many institutional investors aren't happy about the company's dual-class share structure, sending a letter to Lyft asking that it include a sunset clause in its IPO regulatory filings. Under a sunset clause, the company would designate a future date at which time the dual-class share structure would convert into a one share, one vote scenario. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese institutional investors don't like the fact that the company's two founders will control 60% of the votes with just a 7% economic interest. They're especially frustrated because Lyft currently operates a one share, one vote structure as a private company. Love them or hate them, dual-class share structures will always be attractive to entrepreneurs who worry that the short-termism that's so prevalent in Wall Street companies is harmful to a company's long-term success.  * 7 Beaten-Up Stocks to Buy as They Reverse Course I happen to believe that dual-class share structures, in the hands of good corporate stewards, can deliver above-average rewards, then companies without them.To demonstrate what I mean, here are seven dual-class stocks to buy now. Dual-Class Stocks to Buy: Brown-Forman (BF.B, BF.A)Source: Shutterstock George Garvin Brown IV is the chairman of Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF.A, NYSE:BF.B), the Louisville distiller behind Jack Daniel's and other whisky brands. The Brown family control more than 50% of the company's Class A shares. The Class B shares do not come with votes providing the family with a built-in succession plan. It's the ultimate family business. When George Garvin Brown became chairman in 2007, he went to work with former CEO Paul Varga -- Varga retired December 31, 2018, after 15 years in the top job -- to create a &quot;family engagement&quot; committee to keep all the Brown family members, most of whom didn't work at the company, engaged and informed, so that a dual-class share structure wasn't the only thing keeping it in the familial hands. &quot;It's their biggest asset; it's what makes them unique,&quot; said Professor Lloyd Shefsky in 2015. &quot;But there has to be something more for people to go through the extra effort, and sometimes trauma, of continuing family ownership of the business. … Families generally don't work on that enough.&quot;Since Brown IV has been chairman, Brown-Forman stock has appreciated by 493%, or 16.7% annualized. Not bad considering he took over at a time when the economy was ready to collapse, and nobody was drinking whisky. Boy, have times changed.    Constellation Brands (STZ, STZ.B)Source: Shutterstock Lost in the excitement of Constellation Brands' (NYSE:STZ, NYSE:STZ.B) multi-billion-dollar cannabis investment is the fact that the company has a dual-class share structure, with Class A shares getting one vote per share while Class B shares get 10 votes each. Brothers Rob and Richard Sands control the company by owning almost all of its Class B shares. Overall, they have 59% of the all the votes, which translates into a 16% economic interest in Constellation Brands.Recently, Rob Sands stepped down as CEO, to become executive chairman, with the COO, Bill Newlands, stepping into the top role.  Rob Sands was the driving force behind Constellation Brands making a $4 billion investment in Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC). As executive chairman, he'll oversee the company's investment including its push into cannabis-infused drinks. Whether you're talking about its bold move to buy the Modelo beer business in the U.S. a few years ago or its efforts to add a platform for growth beyond beer, spirits, and wine, there's a good chance none of this happens if the Sands' brothers didn't have the ability to look well into the future.  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter Institutions might hate the idea that someone with 16% ownership, controls the business, but when you consider how much effort the family has put into the company -- father Marvin founded it in 1945 -- I wouldn't want anyone else other than the Sands calling the shots. They dream big, and shareholders will be rewarded over the long haul for allowing them to do so. Dual-Class Stocks to Buy: Brookfield Asset Management (BAM)Source: Shutterstock If you're not familiar with the alternative asset manager that recently acquired 62% of Los Angeles-based Oaktree Capital (NYSE:OAK) for more than $4 billion, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) is now about the same size as Blackstone (NYSE:BX) in terms of assets under management. Brookfield CEO Bruce Flatt got a new platform for growth in credit and distressed debt while adding to the company's bench -- Oaktree co-founder Howard Marks will remain at Oaktree for the foreseeable future -- and more importantly, making Brookfield a full-service asset manager. &quot;Brookfield is a leading player in infrastructure, real assets and real estate,&quot; David Fann of TorreyCove Capital Partners said about the deal. &quot;Oaktree is a dominant distressed debt player. After this deal, Brookfield will become a major global provider of alternative investments with offerings that work in both up and down markets.&quot;Again, I'll make my point. The dual-class share structure is only a problem in the absence of talent and vision. Bruce Flatt has plenty of both. Estee Lauder (EL)Source: Shutterstock 2018 wasn't a great year for long-time Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) shareholders; its stock delivered an annual total return of 3.5%. That's okay. As bad as that might seem, it was still 787 basis points higher than the S&P 500. And besides, it's up 24.5% year to date, and if it can hold those gains this is the fifth year in the past decade with an annual total return more than 20%. If you invested $10,000 in Estee Lauder stock a decade ago, today you'd have more than $145,000.Led by CEO Fabrizio Freda, who has been in the top job since 2009, the executive chairman's role is held by William Lauder, who was CEO for a short time before Freda joined the company. The Lauders, who control the company with 87% of the votes, have four board seats out of a total of 16, ensuring that the business goes where they want it to go. I first recommended Estee Lauder stock in April 2013. Since then, I've suggested it on several occasions into 2019.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly As consumer stocks go, I like it as long as the Lauder family has a control position in the company. They know how to exert influence without getting in the way. Nike (NKE)Source: Shutterstock Whenever you read about Nike (NYSE:NKE), it's rare that you see anything that talks about Phil Knight's baby having a dual-class share structure, but it surely does, although not in an obvious way. It has Class A and Class B shares, but there's no 10:1 ratio in terms of votes, or 20:1 in the case of Lyft. No, it uses a more subtle form of control. If you dig into the proxy, you'll see that Class A shareholders elect 75% of the board members and Class B shareholders to elect the rest. Currently, there are 12 directors with nine voted on by the Class A shareholders and three voted on by the Class B shareholders. Care to guess who one of the Class A shareholders is? None other than Travis Knight, Phil Knight's son. Another thing you'll notice is that Swoosh LLC holds 78% of the Class A shares ensuring that Nike's board is stacked with people the founder can trust. It's a slightly different take on the dual-class share structure, but it ultimately is intended to ensure that the company maintains the vision of its founder. As successful as Nike has been, what's not to like? Square (SQ)Source: Via SquareJack Dorsey is CEO of both Square (NYSE:SQ) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Square went public in November 2015; Twitter IPO'd two years earlier in November 2013. Interestingly, Twitter chose to issue only one class of shares, but Square decided to issue two classes. Why is that?Well, a Wall Street Journal article in August 2015, before the company went public, used an interesting analogy with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), then known as Google, that might provide a clue. &quot;From a governance perspective, investors could view 'Alphabet less as a public company than a public-private company hybrid,'&quot; the Journal's Emily Chastan stated at the time, quoting corporate governance expert John Wilson. &quot;Because the company has an unequal voting structure, the founders of Google are uniquely able to take risky bets on new technology,  while simultaneously growing the company's mature search and advertising business.&quot;So, it's possible that Dorsey and company felt that Square needed greater oversight and control, protecting it from the short-term nature of most investors. We'll probably never know for sure. However, what we do know is that Dorsey has 45% of Square's voting power, but only 16% of its equity, whose shares are worth $4.9 billion. Over at Twitter, he has 2.4% of the equity, worth $586 million.   Considering Square's market cap is 32% greater than Twitter's, it seems Dorsey made the right call.   Dual-Class Stocks to Buy: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B)Source: Shutterstock If it weren't for unit investment trusts, you might not be able to buy Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) today. Warren Buffett introduced a second class of shares in May 1996 in response to regular investors seeking a backdoor by buying units of these trusts to get a piece of the Class A shares, which were trading around $22,000 at the time. Baby B's would be worth 1/30th the value of the Class A shares and 1/10,000th the voting rights. &quot;As I have told you before, we made this sale in response to the threatened creation of unit trusts that would have marketed themselves as Berkshire look-alikes. In the process, they would have used our past, and definitely nonrepeatable, record to entice naive small investors and would have charged these innocents high fees and commissions,&quot; Buffett wrote in the company's 1996 shareholder's letter. How about that, even back then, the Oracle of Omaha was railing against high fees in the mutual fund business. Almost 15 years after issuing the B shares, Berkshire Hathaway split them 50-to-1 so that Burlington Northern shareholders could share in the company's future success. Today, the B shares are worth 1/1,500th of a Class A share while the voting rights have stayed the same. If not for Warren Buffett's stand on fees a long time ago, a lot fewer people would likely own the company's stock. That would be a bad thing.  At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-14	2019-02-14 17:05:01	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	5 Consumer Stocks to Cash Out Of	Consumer stocks, particularly those levered to staples or durable goods, offer tremendous appeal during uncertain times. In other cases, companies within the sector that have a more cyclical nature can advantage hot streaks in the markets. Invariably, though, it pays to cash out while the going is good.Indeed, some indicators suggest that trimming exposure to recently labeled hot stocks is a wise move. For one thing, the broader markets have had trouble sustaining earlier momentum. As an example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 8% in January. But so far this month, the index increased by only 2%, well off-pace.Another factor to consider when determining the best course of action for consumer stocks is consumer sentiment. During the last government shutdown, Americans' expectations regarding the economy took a dive. And while a solution to the issue appears on the horizon, it may take time for affected workers to recover.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven if Washington steadies the boat, the country nears a crisis point. Despite the current administration's many promises to the contrary, the national debt spiked to $22 trillion. Current fiscal and tax-related policies, if they remain in place, could worsen the situation. This might play into consumer stocks longer-term.Of course, you still want exposure to a basket of steady, reliable names in your portfolio. But simultaneously, now is an ideal time to consider profiting from a few hot stocks.  * The 10 Best ETFs You Can Buy Here are five consumer investments to cash out of:Source: Shutterstock  Estee Lauder (EL)Among consumer stocks, cosmetics companies like Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) indirectly offer both discretionary and staples exposure. While beauty products are inherently luxury items, various sociological studies indicate that beauty has an economic value. As a result, EL stock offers viability, even in difficult markets.But thanks to its recent surge, shares are now up 19.5% on a year-to-date basis. Certainly, a justification exists for why EL stock trades at a premium. Most notably, the cosmetics firm handily beat consensus estimates for earnings-per-share during its second-quarter 2019 report.However, hot stocks can sometimes get a little too toasty. For all its fundamental strengths, Estee Lauder shares have turned incredibly choppy over the past year. It has also incurred difficulty maintaining its bullish streaks. If you got in early, you may want to strike while the iron is hot.Source:  slgckgc via Flickr (Modified) Church & Dwight (CHD)I'll freely admit that as an investor, I tend to lean toward the spicier end of the scale. That said, when you face uncertainty in the benchmark indices, it pays to buy boring consumer stocks. Within this category, I don't think you can get any more boring than Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD).By no means am I trashing CHD stock. Over the past several years, Church & Dwight has navigated tough market conditions for safety-seeking shareholders. The company's core of essential goods, such as Arm & Hammer and Oxi Clean, ensure relevancy longer-term. Plus, CHD features rising revenues and a history of positive earnings.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever On the flipside, an investment can get too boring. At least partially, this is what plagues CHD stock currently. Since peaking near mid-December of last year, shares have had trouble moving the needle. Again, if you got in earlier, you may want to take some off the table.Source: Shutterstock  Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI)During the tumultuous years following the Great Recession, several consumer stocks had an unfortunately recurring problem: convincing consumers to consume. But within this malaise, Ollie's Bargain Outlet (NASDAQ:OLLI) went decisively against the grain. Over the last three-and-a-half years, OLLI stock jumped well over 330%.What's the secret to their runaway success? I wrote in the summer of 2017 that Ollie's operated on a &quot;keep-it-simple&quot; strategy. Unlike dollar stores, the discounter retailer focuses on brand-name goods. Essentially, they sell quality products at low prices: it's really hard to screw this strategy up!Indeed, I felt that OLLI stock could weather market storms far better than its peers. Despite some scary moments, I was proven correct on a net basis. At the same time, I don't want to push my luck. Because OLLI doesn't pay a dividend, it relies purely on capital gains.At this juncture, I'd probably cash out, and wait for a reset.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Five Below (FIVE)If you didn't know any better, you might think that Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) references cold-weather attire. It doesn't. In fact, FIVE stock is one of the hottest among recently celebrated hot stocks. Not to belabor the reference, but over the trailing five-year period, shares have gained a whopping 259%.Like Ollie's, the retailer runs a very simple, but effective strategy: selling quality goods at attractive prices. But what separates FIVE stock from other discount stores is that they specifically cater to youth. Management also understands their audience. Leveraging social media, Five Below markets their products in a manner that's relevant and age-appropriate.  * 7 Reasons to Own Coca-Cola Stock More importantly, the company's efforts have delivered impressive fiscal results. Given its 30% YTD performance, FIVE stock is still going strong. Nevertheless, it hasn't convincingly challenged upside resistance at $133. This might be a signal to cash out and wait for a better re-entry point.Source: Shutterstock  Canada Goose (GOOS)Thanks to the record-breaking cold weather that has recently impacted several countries, Canada Goose's (NYSE:GOOS) profile skyrocketed. Renowned for their ultra-warm outerwear that both comfort and protect, Canada Goose is one of those consumer stocks that you'd think is a no-brainer.But a cursory look at the one-year chart for GOOS stock tells a different story. Since early summer of last year, shares have gyrated wildly, but with a decidedly bearish tilt. Although the brand has multiple tailwinds - including positive engagement with Chinese customers despite the trade war - investors have shied away from its trouble spots.For one thing, the company has driven up its expenses and overhead to feed its expansion efforts. Also, GOOS stock is liable to PR concerns. Primarily, animal-rights activists accuse the apparel maker for disturbing slaughtering practices. That, and the fact that GOOS doesn't pay a dividend may not sit well with prospective buyers.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Some experts suggested that with U.S. GDP growth projected to slow, investors should rotate into more defensive sectors such as consumer staples and healthcare. However, others said the markets would surprise the pessimists with a robust recovery.&quot;Based on fundamentals, I don't think the pullback we had in this market was ever justified. Markets will do what they'll do. I think you have significant upside here,&quot; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equities strategist at Credit Suisse, told CNBC on Dec. 31. &quot;Therefore, we would think that the bottom has been put in this market.&quot;If you lean toward 2019 being a bounce-back year, consumer stocks are an excellent choice to ride the wave.One metric that drives the share prices of consumer stocks is the strength of the job market. If Americans are employed and their wages are growing, that will help consumer spending. Well, the U.S. has trounced expectations in two nonfarm payrolls reports announced this year (December and January), which should go a long way toward strengthening consumer spending trends.Here are 10 of the best consumer stocks to buy for 2019. Some of these stocks are more defensive in nature - better suited for a volatile year. A few others are more aggressive and could ride a bullish wave better than most.

2019-02-06	2019-02-06 10:01:25	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Chase The Rally In Estee Lauder Stock	"Shares of global cosmetics giant Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) soared after the company reported a double-beat-and-raise second-quarter earnings report which broadly affirmed the strength of the company's underlying growth narrative. EL stock jumped more than 10% higher in response.

The report itself was very good. Revenue topped expectations, and revenue growth remained broadly robust, even in the slowing Asia-Pacific region. Earnings topped expectations, too, and margins continued on their multi-year march higher. Management lifted its sales and profit growth outlooks for 2019, as well.

Overall, Estee Lauder reported Q2 numbers and gave a great guide. That combination warrants a pop in EL stock; but that doesn't mean investors should chase the shares here.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Instead, I think this rally might actually be worth fading. EL stock is pushing up against technical levels which have historically proven to be a top in the stock. Also, the underlying fundamentals don't necessarily support prices above $150 just yet for Estee Lauder stock.

In short: Estee Lauder reported really good numbers which warranted a pop in the stock. But, up more than 10% on the day, this rally is overdone, and EL stock is both overbought and overvalued here.

### Strong Numbers Affirm Secular Growth Narrative

Estee Lauder's Q2 numbers were very good. Broadly speaking, they eased concerns regarding the potential for a growth slowdown amid deteriorating global economic conditions, while confirming that the drivers underlying the cosmetics markets around the world remain robust.

Revenue growth in the quarter was 11%, consistent with the past several quarters. Of note, the Asia-Pacific region saw sales rise 20% in a period that was supposed to be weak for the region. Meanwhile, essentially all product segments outside of fragrance benefited from 5%-plus constant currency revenue growth in the quarter.

In the big picture, Estee Lauder has been a healthy, 5%-plus revenue growth company for several years now. There have been healthy trends underlying the global cosmetics market, including the widespread emergence and adoption of photo-sharing and visual-first apps like Instagram and Snapchat, which have created the Selfie Generation. That population is more concerned with how they look than prior generations, and as such, are dedicating more share of wallet to cosmetics products.

This trend has powered steady 4-5% growth across the whole cosmetics industry over the past several years. Estee Lauder has grown share in this market along with sales. Nothing about either of these trends shows signs of reversing course any time soon. As such, the second quarter affirmed that Estee Lauder will remain a 5%-plus revenue growth company for the foreseeable future.

Meanwhile, on the margin side of things, Estee Lauder continues to benefit from opex leverage. Robust sales growth has allowed the company to exercise opex discipline, and drive the company's overall expense rate lower. Consequently, as revenues have grown at a healthy rate over the past several years, margins have risen, too. This remained true in the second quarter. Operating margins rose 120 basis points year-over-year to 22.1%.

Overall, Estee Lauder's Q2 numbers confirmed that macroeconomic weakness is having a negligible effect on the EL growth narrative, and that this remains a 5%-plus revenue growth and healthy margin expansion company.

### Yet, EL Stock Looks Overbought and Overvalued

Although the numbers were good, EL stock has overshot itself here above $150.

From a technical perspective, Estee Lauder stock has already tested prices above $150 three times in the past year. The stock always quickly retreated. In April 2018, the shares hit $150, then dropped to $130 within a month. EL stock retook the $150 level in June 2018, before dropping back to $130 by August. The stock hit $150 again in early December. It dropped to $120 three weeks later.

So, history says this is a precarious position for EL stock.

  * 7 Stocks That Won Super Bowl Sunday 



The fundamentals corroborate this. At best, Estee Lauder grows revenues by 6-8% over the next several years, and operating margins trend towards 20% by fiscal 2024. Modeling those out, I think a reasonable EPS target for this company by fiscal 2024 is $8. Based on a historically average 26x forward multiple, that equates to a fiscal 2023 price target of $208. Discounted back by 9% per year (1% less than my normal 10% discount rate to account for the yield), that equates to a fiscal 2019 price target below $150.

EL stock is above that level, and we are only half way through fiscal 2019. Consequently, this stock seems reasonably overvalued here.

Estee Lauder is a great company with strong fundamentals. But, those fundamentals don't support a $150-plus price tag for EL stock just yet. This rally will likely fade, much like similar rallies above $150 have over the past year.

As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Just as it was on the way down though, markets can stay oversold or overbought longer than investors expect and if the path of least resistance is higher, than that's where stocks will gravitate to. Let's examine some top stock trades.

### Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #1: Alphabet

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) crushed earnings expectations, but pulled back several percent on Tuesday's open. However, GOOGL was able to claw back its losses on the day, getting back to flat on the session.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio 



I love that shares are holding over the $1,120 level as well as the 200-day moving average. Now flirting with the $1,140 level, GOOGL stock looks like it wants to push higher. It already made a strong move over downtrend resistance (blue line) last week and the $1,180 to $1,200 level doesn't seem out of the picture.

On the downside, I need to see GOOGL stay above prior downtrend resistance as well as current uptrend support (purple line).  


### Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #2: Boeing

Boeing (NYSE:BA) continues to fly higher and is playing into our trade perfectly. We wanted to see BA stock hold its earnings-based gains from last week and told investors to watch if shares would consolidate just below resistance. It did and now we're having another large move higher.

There was time to get in BA even after earnings, but traders who missed this one should take a pass. The stock is technically overbought in the short-term and while that doesn't mean the run is over, it certainly diminishes the risk/reward. BA could get up to $420 or $425 if the market cooperates and momentum continues, but look to buy on a pullback, particularly if BA revisits $390 and its holds as support.

### Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #3: Gilead Sciences

Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) is pulling back after its earnings miss, but is staying above $67. This $66 to $67 level has been a notable level for buyers, so investors could consider this a solid risk/reward long entry.

Should it hold, a rebound up to $70 is likely, which opens the door to more potential. But if support fails, a dip to $63 or below is certainly possible.

### Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #4: Estee Lauder

Shares of Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) are flying Tuesday, up 12.5% after beating on earnings and revenue expectations. The $152.50 level has been a tough nut to crack and investors are going to be on the fence after Tuesday's action.

After rallying up to $157, new highs looked to be on the way. However, EL stock has backed off its highs by about $5 per share, leaving it teetering precariously on that $152-and-a-half level. A fall below this mark has me looking at the $145 to $146 level for support. If the $152.50 breakout sticks, look for a retest of Tuesday's highs in the not-too-distance future.

### Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #5: Starbucks

We hit on Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) late last month, saying investors could look for a retest of the highs after the stock reversed its big one-session losses following its earnings results.

Shares are cracking over this mark now and should we get a slight pullback on Wednesday, investors may consider gobbling up the stock for a run up to and over $70 per share. This one has momentum, particularly if the market keeps up. I would love to see shares open red on Wednesday morning and quickly reverse to green, giving buyers a chance to hop on board.

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is negative 
  * ETFs holding this stock are seeing positive inflows but are weakening 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output in this company's sector is expanding



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is low for EL with fewer than 5% of shares on loan. The last change in the short interest score occurred more than 1 month ago and implies that there has been little change in sentiment among investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Negative

ETF activity is negative and may be weakening. The net inflows of $284 million over the last one-month into ETFs that hold EL are among the lowest of the last year and appear to be slowing.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Positive

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Consumer Goods sector is rising. The rate of growth is strong relative to the trend shown over the past year, and is accelerating.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Negative

The current level displays a negative indicator. EL credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels of the last 3 years, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## New collaboration

On January 7, International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF) announced that it has entered into a collaboration with Aryballe—an olfaction technology company located in Grenoble, France. However, International Flavors and Fragrances didn’t disclose the financial aspects of the collaboration.

The collaboration between International Flavors and Fragrances and Aryballe aims to develop odor-sensing and quality control applications that can be applied in food, cosmetics, fragrance, and other industries. The technology could provide a new experience for International Flavors and Fragrances’ customers.

Nicolas Mirzayantz, the divisional CEO of International Flavors and Fragrances’ Scent segment, said, “Our innovation team is thrilled to work with Aryballe on evolving this innovative device to one that is indispensable to the F&F space. We believe that we are only scratching the surface of its potential for our industry – its applications seem virtually limitless!”

## Stock performance

International Flavors and Fragrances stock fell 0.9% and closed at $134.95 for the week ending January 11. The decline in the stock price resulted in the trend reversal in International Flavors and Fragrances’ 100-day moving average price. Currently, International Flavors and Fragrances is trading 1.3% below the 100-day moving average price of $136.74. The company’s 100-day moving average price has fallen from a high of $150. However, the price has recovered to the current levels from the low of $128.90.

So far in 2019, International Flavors and Fragrances stock has gained ~2.1%. Sensient Technologies (SXT) and Clorox (CLX) have gained 7.9% and 0.2%, respectively, while Estée Lauder (EL) has declined 2.0%.

Analysts expect International Flavors and Fragrances’ target price to be $148.4, which implies a return potential of 10% over the closing price as of January 11.

Investors looking for indirect exposure to International Flavors and Fragrances could consider the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Materials ETF (RTM), which invested 3.9% of its portfolio in the company as of January 11.

For 2019, portfolio-building strategies are increasingly focusing on defensive stocks. And why not? There are a host of headwinds facing stocks as we head into the new year, be it high share prices, interest rates, slowing economic growth across the world or trade uncertainty, among other negative factors. &quot;For equity investors, risk is high and the margin of safety is low because stock valuations are elevated compared with history,&quot; Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin recently told investors. No wonder defense is in. Companies from sectors such as health care and consumer staples offer goods and services that people need no matter what the economy is doing, which leads to more reliable revenues and profits. Still, even outside those sectors, there are a few resilient blue chips that either dominate their market so completely or offer such diversified product lines that they can hang in most market environments. These are the kinds of stocks investors want to pile into. Here are seven &quot;Strong Buy&quot; defensive stocks to buy as we head into 2019. We used TipRanks&apos; Stock Screener to pinpoint &quot;safer&quot; stocks that Wall Street&apos;s analyst community is overwhelmingly bullish on at the moment. Just remember: No stock is completely insulated from broad-market downdrafts, including these. But all seven should broadly stand up well during a longer-term period of instability.

2018-10-15	2018-10-15 19:55:30	EL	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.	The 5 Best Dividend Growth Stocks for the Rest of 2018	Yield isn&apos;t everything when it comes to dividend investing. Indeed, a steady, rising payout is what leads to long-term capital appreciation. Dividend growth not only makes a stock more attractive to new income investors, but also rewards existing investors with increasingly higher yields on shares purchased at lower prices in the past. Additionally, dividend growth tends to be a sign of health, analysts say. &quot;Companies with the ability to consistently grow dividend payments tend to be strong franchises,&quot; says Tony DeSpirito, portfolio manager for BlackRock&apos;s equity dividend portfolios. &quot;A healthy balance sheet and ample free cash flow provide the means to grow the dividend.&quot; After running the numbers on all dividend payers among the 1,200 largest U.S. companies, analysts at Blockforce Capital (formerly Reality Shares) identified the best dividend growth stocks to buy now.

Analysts say there&apos;s less chance for Estee Lauder to report earnings-per-share beats on margins due to tariff costs. There are also reports of Chinese customs agents employing tighter controls. &quot;We believe increased scrutiny at border control was another shoe to drop in the prestige/luxury goods industry after investor sentiment already turned more cautious due to uncertainty on how Chinese consumption will be impacted by the current tariff war,&quot; analysts wrote. J.P. Morgan said it is &quot;de-rating&quot; in luxury because of the exposure to China.
