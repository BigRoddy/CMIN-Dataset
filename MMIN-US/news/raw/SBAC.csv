Castle and SBA already hosted Verizon infrastructure equipment. Verizon won an average of 161 MHz of C-band nationwide spectrum in the recent FCC auction. The C-band offered greater speeds and coverage for both mobility, home broadband, and business internet solutions. The 5G Ultra-Wideband deployment on the spectrum required new network equipment, including basebands and antennas on existing towers. The deals with both Crown Castle and SBA Communications offered process improvements leading to Verizon's faster deployment of C-band equipment. Both the agreements established terms for leasing space on existing towers for C-band equipment. The addition of the C-band spectrum will enable Verizon to offer the differentiated 5G Ultra-Wideband mobility service to an additional 250 million customers offering the internet provider choice to 50 million additional customers, stated Verizon SVP Heidi Hemmer. Price action: VZ shares traded higher by 0.10% at $57.55 on the last check Monday.

2021-03-08	2021-03-08 15:11:28	SBAC	SBA Communications Corporation	Ex-Dividend Date Insight: SBA Communications	SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC) declared a dividend payable on March 26, 2021 to its shareholders as of February 22, 2021. It was also announced that shareholders of SBA Communications's stock as of March 10, 2021 are entitled to the dividend. The stock is expected to become ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. SBA Communications has an ex-dividend date set for for March 9, 2021. The company's current dividend payout is $0.58, which equates to a dividend yield of 0.89% at current price levels. What Is An Ex-Dividend Date? An ex-dividend date is when a company's shares stop trading with its current dividend payout in preparation for the company to announce a new one. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Typically, companies will announce and implement new dividend yields on a quarterly basis. SBA Communications's Dividend Performance Over the past year, SBA Communications has seen its dividend payouts and yields climb upward overall. Last year (March 9, 2020), the company's payout sat at $0.47, which has since increased by $0.11. SBA Communications's dividend yield last year was 0.64%, which has since grown by 0.25%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. To read more about SBA Communications click here.

2021-03-05	2021-03-05 18:31:32	SBAC	SBA Communications Corporation	Raymond James Upgrades SBA Communications: Valuation More Attractive Versus Historical Levels	"Wireless communications infrastructure owner SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: SBAC) offers a more attractive risk despite a shift in sentiment away from ""safer names"" like tower stocks, according to Raymond James. The SBA Communications Analyst: Ric Prentiss upgraded SBA communications' stock rating from Outperform to Strong Buy with an unchanged $309 price target. The SBA Communications Thesis: SBA's stock has lost more than 20% over the past six months amid expectations for higher interest rates and investors flocking towards ""re-opening"" stocks, Prentiss wrote in the upgrade note. However, SBA has two catalysts ahead that would translate to upside potential for the stock. First, REIT-focused funds are likely to seek out exposure to infrastructure stocks like SBA. Second, upcoming analyst day presentations at major cell phone carriers could emphasize the bullish case for tower stocks. Related Link: Benzinga's Top Ratings Upgrades, Downgrades For March 5, 2021 SBA stands out among its peers given: 1) Superior exposure to U.S. towers. 2) Higher quality-adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) to funds available for distribution (FAD) conversion. 3) Expectations for superior dividend growth. 4) A reputation for buying back stock ""opportunistically."" ""All in all, we like all three tower stocks, but think the FAD valuation and AFFO/share and Dividend/share growth profiles are most attractive at SBAC, and we see significant upside,"" the analyst wrote. SBAC Price Action: Shares of SBA Communications were trading higher by nearly 2% Friday afternoon at $240.11.

Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for the earnings announcement. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Analysts expect SBA Communications earnings of $0.52 per share. Revenue will likely be around $529.21 million, according to the consensus estimate. SBA Communications EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $0.59. Revenue was $513.66 million. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin. View more earnings on SBAC The analyst consensus estimate would represent a 11.86% decrease in the company's earnings. Revenue would be up 3.03% on a year-over-year basis. SBA Communications's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 0.46 0.3 0.40 0.39 EPS Actual 0.20 0.2 0.38 0.59 Revenue Estimate 516.04 M 501.81 M 513.61 M 506.90 M Revenue Actual 522.94 M 507.23 M 517.07 M 513.66 M Stock Performance Shares of SBA Communications were trading at $262.8 as of February 18. Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 11.31%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are likely unhappy going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. SBA Communications is scheduled to hold the call at 17:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.

2020-11-17	2020-11-17 10:00:02	SBAC	SBA Communications Corporation	When Tesla Joins the S&P 500, You Know It’s Game Over	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In an anecdote often attributed to President John F. Kennedy’s father, the moment he knew to get out of the 1920s stock market boom was when he started receiving share tips from his shoeshine boy. You can make a similar argument about the moment that leading equity indexes finally give their blessing to an up-and-coming stock. The latest and most dramatic instance of that will happen next month, when the S&P 500  will admit Tesla Inc. through its club doors for the first time.Take Yahoo Inc. The archetypal dotcom business found its way into America’s prime share index in December 1999, just four months before a collapse in internet stocks that took the U.S. more than a decade to recover from. New admissions in the mid-2000s were rich with real estate plays such as CBRE Group Inc., Boston Properties Inc., and Kimco Realty Corp. Those companies were then hammered by the subprime and 2008 financial crises. Is this time really going to be any different?To be sure, it looks like Tesla is on more solid footing than two years ago, when regulators were lobbing fraud charges against Elon Musk and the company was, in his words, “single-digit weeks” away from bankruptcy. Its elevation to the S&P 500 had been predicted ever since second-quarter results chalked up a fourth consecutive period of profit, passing one crucial criterion that keeps a lot of startups out of the index.Looked at from the more exacting perspective of operating cash, it’s doing even better. The $2.4 billion inflow in the third quarter alone was more than total operating cash in the decade through September 2019. The auto industry as a whole seems to be performing remarkably well in the grip of Covid-19, with the S&P’s automobile and parts sub-index Monday hitting its highest level in more than two years.Tesla is already the 11th-largest company by market capitalization on U.S. exchanges, worth about as much as the world's three biggest carmakers Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. put together. Casual investors are likely to see their index-tracking funds turn them into indirect Tesla shareholders whether they like it or not. So what’s not to like?The lingering question is around valuation. Tesla is past the point where it’s at imminent risk of demise, but it’s still very hard to justify the price put on the stock. Returns on equity are only just pulling even with the broader automobiles sub-index. Even analyst estimates that they’ll rise north of 20% over the coming years will only bring them in line with what were, until recently, considered normal levels for an industry that’s been out of favor with investors for years.That sort of pedestrian financial performance is hard to square with Tesla’s eye-wateringly expensive stock. The median price of S&P 500 constituents is 20.89 times blended forward 12-month earnings. Tesla’s price-earnings ratio is 113, which would be enough to give it the richest rating on the index after Under Armour Inc., Boeing Co., and SBA Communications Corp. Comparing forward Ebitda to enterprise value, just six companies have higher valuations than Tesla’s 49.51 times multiple.It’s very hard to see how Tesla will be able to justify those valuations in the long term. That’s the case even if you agree with the most bullish analysts and assume the company will be producing about $10 billion a year of net income by 2022 or 2023, compared with $556 million over the past 12 months. On those numbers, a 20 times price-earnings multiple would produce a business worth not much more than half of Tesla’s current $387 billion market cap.That’s the true lesson for newcomers to the big indexes. For every Yahoo or AOL Inc. that turns into a parable of market excess, there’s a Kimco or CBRE that survives but never recaptures the magic that propelled it into the limelight. Yahoo’s 1999 hype ultimately fell victim to the better search technology being developed by a then little-known startup called Google. The race to dominate electric vehicles over the coming decade will scarcely be less competitive. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

Revenues of the real estate investment trust, which owns and operates wireless communications infrastructure increased 3% year-on-year to $522.9 million and surpassed analysts’ expectations of $516 million.SBA Communications’ (SBAC) adjusted fund from operations (AFFO), a key measure of profitability, increased 10.7% to $2.38 per share and exceeded analysts’ forecasts of $2.32.The company’s CEO Jeff Stoops said, ""US wireless customer activity picked up in the third quarter relative to the first half of 2020, although still slightly behind year-ago levels. This was evident from our services results and new domestic lease activity, as all three US nationwide wireless carriers were and are active. Internationally, leasing activity was slightly above the first half of the year as well.” (See SBAC stock analysis on TipRanks).Buoyed by stronger-than-expected quarterly performance, SBA raised its full-year earnings outlook. The company now projects adjusted EPS between $9.27 and $9.50, up from the earlier guidance range of $8.94-$9.33. It expects revenues to be in the range of $2.065-$2.085 billion, compared with the previous forecast of $2.047-$2.087 billion.Following the earnings release, Raymond James analyst Ric Prentiss reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. However, Prentiss lowered the price target to $327 (12.4% upside potential) from $366 saying that “we think our thesis of a long runway of leasing in a low-interest-rate environment remains intact, but the timing of the U.S. leasing rebound is still uncertain.”Currently, the Street has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus is based on 4 Buys and only 1 Hold. The average price target of $330.80 implies upside potential of about 13.7% to current levels. Shares are up 20.7% year-to-date.Related News:   Comcast In Talks With Walmart To Develop Smart TVs – Report   Fox’s 1Q Profit Soars 42% As Costs Drop; Needham Says Hold   Johnson’s 4Q Sales Drop As Covid-19 Hurts Building Solutions Demand More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Humana Lifts 2020 Medicare Membership Outlook; Shares Rise 4%   * McKesson Raises Full-Year Earnings Guidance, Shares Up 5%   * AT&T; Mulls Sale Of DirecTV Stake - Report   * Super Micro Computer Pops 13% After-Hours On Stellar Earnings Beat"	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sba-communications-lifts-2020-profit-075500486.html?.tsrc=rss

Here is Benzinga's look at SBA Communications's Q3 earnings report.What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS.Earnings And Revenue Sell-side analysts expect SBA Communications's EPS to be near $0.45 on sales of $516.04 million. In the same quarter last year, SBA Communications reported EPS of $0.19 on revenue of $507.55 million.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values.View more earnings on SBACThe Wall Street consensus estimate for earnings would represent a 136.84% increase for the company. Sales would be up 1.67% on a year-over-year basis. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past:Quarter Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2019  EPS Estimate 0.3 0.40 0.39 0.34  EPS Actual 0.2 0.38 0.59 0.19  Revenue Estimate 501.81 M 513.61 M 506.90 M 496.76 M  Revenue Actual 507.23 M 517.07 M 513.66 M 507.55 M  Stock Performance Shares of SBA Communications were trading at $295.02 as of October 29. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 25.1%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably happy going into this earnings release.Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call.

The combined market value gained by just five of those stocks is almost the same as the amount lost by 30 REITs specializing in malls and shopping centers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.“If you’re a real estate investor and your mandate is to own real estate, you’re obviously not doing very well owning offices or owning retail,” Cowen analyst Colby Synesael said in a phone interview.With more people at home, the demands on technology and its infrastructure have been tremendous, whether it’s allowing for online shopping, mobile streaming or working remotely. As a result, certain REITs have emerged as defensive plays for investors, Synesael said.American Tower Corp., Digital Reality Trust Inc., Equinix Inc., Crown Castle International Inc. and SBA Communications Corp. have added roughly $50 billion in total market capitalization this year, and valuations for towers and data centers have never been higher.Data centers, for instance, are trading at a roughly 15% premium to the overall REIT average on a price to estimated adjusted funds from operations basis, according to Berenberg analyst Nate Crossett. Historically they’ve traded at a 7% discount.As a global data center company, Equinix has boasted of its work building out coverage and scale for clients that have gone on to become household names in the work-from-home era including Zoom and Cisco Systems Inc.’s Webex.“Two significant customers of ours is Zoom and Webex -- both of whom obviously saw exceptional increases in their demand as work from home took off,” Chief Executive Officer Charles Meyers said in an interview. “We played a very key role in helping them ramp up their capacity to meet that demand. That was true also in networking cloud providers.”Meyers said it’s difficult to anticipate how much more revenue the company could see over time. In terms of demand, he pointed to recent overall online traffic trends, which surged 25% to 30% over a 30- to 45-day period-- growth that normally would take nine months to a year to achieve.Digital Realty Chief Financial Officer Andy Power said in an interview that the company had seen a pickup in data center demand from clients filling near-term gaps but that longer-term, he was “pleasantly surprised” at how larger enterprises were also taking this moment to plan for the future.“We’re seeing the criticality of our infrastructure playing out front and center while many of our other asset classes [in real estate] are seeing sloping rent,” he said. Even for clients in struggling industries such as travel, the company has seen increased deployments. “Our services are fundamentally mission critical for their businesses. You cannot book an airline ticket or any hotel reservation without the infrastructure we’re essentially providing.”Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lindsay Dutch said the need for increased connectivity during the pandemic has demonstrated the importance of digital infrastructure, which is a long-term driver for the stocks.“If you think of everyone on their computers, trying to connect to their workplace and do all these Zoom calls and stream Netflix -- that creates more traffic and the need for power,” she said.Before the virus, shares in tech-related REITs had already been rising, catching the attention of investors, Cowen’s Synesael said.For communication towers, he noted a sea change in 2018 when Vanguard Group began adding towers to its investment portfolio, prompting more investors to do the same ahead of the U.S. rollout of 5G spectrum.Unlike data centers, tower stocks aren’t seeing a fundamental change in earnings from the pandemic, Synesael said. However, they are still benefiting from trends Covid-19 has accelerated like mobile data use, which Synesael expects to continue.Despite their relative premium, Berenberg’s Crossett said that on an absolute basis “there’s still plenty of room to run” for data center stocks.“To the extent that there’s a pullback, I would be adding to these names,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-exposed-real-estate-pulling-154740149.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-06-23	2020-06-23 23:29:06	SBAC	SBA Communications Corporation	The Coming 5G Boom Is Not Fully Priced in These 3 Stocks	The late, great, Neil Peart wrote, in Tom Sawyer, “He knows changes aren’t permanent, but change is.” His words are an apt description of our modern world, an ever-changing landscape of pending tech. Right now, the shiny new change is 5G.Even the coronavirus couldn’t fully derail the coming build-out of the new 5G networks. It only delayed it. China and Korea are leading the world right now in bringing 5G networks online, with the US expanding its own new systems and Europe lagging behind. In the US, most urban areas have at least partial 5G connectivity online, and the major service providers are working to connect those centers.For investors, the key here will be finding companies that are primed to gain as 5G expands. It’s tempting to invest directly in the service providers; AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile/Sprint, the three largest wireless providers, are all heavily invested in 5G networks. But they face certain headwinds that make them less than ideal as 5G investments – for the present. They are absorbing the costs of the new networks, but without bringing in the new service fees to cover those costs. From a consumer perspective, the new service is more expensive, but hasn’t surpassed existing 4G in convenience – yet.This leaves investors seeking the right place to put their money, to benefit from 5G rollouts. Two segments come to mind, both deeply involved in different ways. The first is semiconductor chips; the second, surprisingly, are real estate investment trusts. These companies, inhabiting such different niches, find themselves well-positioned to profit – for different reasons – as 5G networks expand. Those different reasons are interesting to explore, as we open the TipRanks database to see what makes semiconductors and REITs compelling investments for 5G. Let's take a closer look. Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)First up is a long-running major market player, a large-cap stock and a perennial champion for dividend investors. Broadcom is also one of the world’s largest semiconductor chip makers, ranked the sixth biggest by annual revenue in 2019, and reporting $5.25 billion in earnings in the first quarter of 2020.Broadcom has been making waves in 5G throughout 1H20. In February, the company announced completion of a 5G switching portfolio, designed for high-capacity switches and offering the feature set needed to meet new 5G tech standards. In March, Broadcom was noted by Forbes as one of the leaders in 5G wireless infrastructure; the company is deeply invested in providing chips that power the new devices. And earlier this month, handset maker Nokia, which has been having trouble in recent months sourcing 5G chips in sufficient quantity to meet demand, signed Broadcom on a supplier of 5G chips for Nokia’s ReefShark line.With all of this good news for the company, it’s no wonder that AVGO shares have climbed 85% since hitting bottom on March 18, dramatically outperforming the broader markets. Q2 saw revenue grow to $5.74 billion, up 9% sequentially. And, despite the ongoing pandemic, the company has maintained its generous dividend, declaring $3.25 per share on June 4. The current dividend annualizes to $13 and gives an impressive yield of 4.3%.Writing on AVGO for Deutsche Bank is 5-star analyst Ross Seymore, rated 26 overall in the TipRanks analyst database. Seymore notes the Nokia arrangement, and points out that it plays to Broadcom’s strengths in addressing the 5G needs of OEM customers: “We view [the Nokia] announcement as evidence that the co's investments and engagement with infrastructure OEMs on solutions within the base station which AVGO referenced in December, are bearing fruit. Broadcom's strength in custom ASICs and in routing and switching have enabled the co to leverage its Ethernet technology in bringing the network to the Edge (base stations).”To this end, Seymore rates AVGO a Buy alongside a $360 price target, indicating a potential 16% upside for the stock this year. (To watch Seymore’s track record, click here)All in all, Broadcom has a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, with 24 reviews breaking down to 21 Buys and only 3 Holds. Shares are priced at $311.30, and the average price target of $350.18 suggests an upside potential of 13%. (See AVGO stock analysis on TipRanks)SBA Communications (SBAC)The next stock on our list operates as a REIT, focused on cellular infrastructure sites. Specifically, SBA Communications owns small cells, distributed antenna systems, and traditional cell sites throughout the Americas and South Africa. SBA both leases and develops the properties in its portfolio – a business that perfectly positions the company to profit as telecom carriers and providers increase and densify their networks to accommodate 5G technology. This process naturally requires new cell towers, antenna placements, and small cells – and that is SBA’s core business.Standing as it does at the center of the 5G expansion, SBA is already showing gains. The company’s stock is up 4.6% since February, having fully recovered from the market collapse in February/March and survived several weeks of price volatility that followed. It’s not just share price that has gained despite coronavirus-inspired recessionary pressures. SBA has reported modest sequential gains in quarterly earnings since the beginning of 2019, a trend that continued in Q1 2020. Credit Suisse analyst Sami Badri is confident in this company’s business model and solid balance sheet. He writes, “We believe the evidence points to an initial majority mid-band spectrum buildout. Mid-band spectrum will mainly be utilized on macro towers, given its solid propagation characteristics, therefore the initial 5G wave should favor macro tower focused SBAC… With SBAC capable of raising debt at such modest rates (3.875% May 19th) while maintaining its broader tower asset ROIC of 10%, we are comfortable and constructive with its current leverage profile.”Badri rates SBAC an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $361 price target indicates his belief in a 23% upside potential for the stock. (To watch Badri’s track record, click here)Overall, the analyst consensus rating on SBAC, a Strong Buy is based on a 9-to-1 split between Buy and Hold reviews. The average price target, $328, implies an upside of 12% from the current trading price of $293.78. (See SBAC stock analysis on TipRanks)American Tower (AMT)Last up is American Tower, the Boston-based REIT with a global portfolio containing more than 180,000 cellular broadcast tower and wireless communication sites. The core of the portfolio is in the US, but the company has been expanding internationally, both to supplement the core holdings and to take advantage of the global nature of wireless com systems. AMT currently holds more than 40,000 US cellular sites, along with 75,000 Asia and 37,000 in Latin America.As wireless providers expand their networks to introduce 5G connections, AMT is a logical beneficiary. Due to the shorter range of 5G systems, a denser tower network will be required; AMT, which owns and leases such sites, is ramping up acquisitions to take advantage. AMT derives most of its customer base – on the order of 88% – AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint/T-Mobile. These companies are not going anywhere, and lend a sense of permanence to AMT’s holdings.In addition, due to the long-term nature of cellular leases, AMT features a high proportion of recurring revenue in its portfolio – a feature that has insulated the company from the impact of COVID-19. AMT reported sequential gains in earnings for Q1, the coronavirus quarter, and share prices have shown a net gain during the last few months of market volatility.Analyst Sami Badri covers AMT shares as well, and he writes of the stock: “We expect Massive MIMO antennas to place more weight on towers, while taking up the same amount of physical vertical space or more on the structure. This will result in more revenue from tower leasing activity for AMT, which we expect to appear primarily as amendment revenues.”Badri is bullish on AMT, giving the stock a Buy rating with a $300 price target. His target implies an upside of 13% in the coming 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. AMT’s rating is based on 14 reviews, including 12 Buys and just 2 Holds. Shares are selling for $265.60, and the $269.42 suggests a modest upside this year.

2020-01-15	2020-01-15 14:02:03	SBAC	SBA Communications Corporation	Goldman Sachs: 3 5G Stocks to Snap Up Now	In a set of interesting reports, Goldman Sachs telecom expert Brett Feldman turns his eye on the American wireless market – and its growing rollover to 5G technology. Feldman notes five reasons why 5G will drive a period of sustained growth for companies with an ‘in.’ While the analyst focuses on tower-leasing REITs, his basic point applies to most companies with a strong connection to the 5G switchover: wireless providers, device makers, chip makers.A look at three of Feldman’s points outlines what we can expect in the next couple of years, as 5G networks expand across the country. First, he notes the obvious – that 2020 will see an expansion of 5G coverage by the Big 4 mobile providers. Second, Apple will launch a 5G capable iPhone this year, which should help drive adoption of the new technology for the next several years. Third, as more users switch to 5G devices, data usage will increase, driving increased cell site density – it will be a virtuous circle.Feldman’s final two points touch on what he sees as the bottom line for investors interested in 5G stocks: that cell tower owners and operators are the best stock position to take as the switch begins and expands. For his fourth point, he notes that auctions this year and next will open up the mid-band spectrum, and drive tower new tower leases. And finally, in point five, Feldman sees the deployment of new antennas and consequent increase of mid-band spectrum use, driving the expansion of towers and the increase in tower loading and usage going forward.The move to 5G has potential to turn wireless markets upside down. The Big 4 have all initiated coverage in the new network, but so far only T-Mobile has launched it nation-wide. AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon are initiating 5G coverage on the high-band spectrum in limited, dense, urban markets. And a group of REITs that specialize in tower properties are positioned to gain, no matter how the chips fall out for the wireless providers.In this article, we’ll look at three Goldman Sachs 5G stock recommendations. All three score high on TipRanks’ Smart Score system – rating a 9 or 10. The Smart Score brings together collects and collates data on more than 6,500 stocks, information drawn from across the TipRanks database, and distills it down to a single number. A 9 or 10 rating indicates that the stock is likely to outperform the broader markets in the coming months.SBA Communications Corporation (SBAC)First up is SBA Communications, a real estate investment trust. REITs are companies that buy, own, and operate various residential and commercial properties, making their profits on through rents and management fees. Cell tower properties are a common commercial investment for REITs, and as pointed out above, this combination is Brett Feldman’s favorite 5G investment. SBA is exactly that type of REIT; it owns and operates wireless infrastructure, including small cells, distributed antenna systems, and traditional cell sites.The popularity of wireless systems, the necessity of the tech infrastructure to modern life, and the switch to 5G have all put SBA on an upward trajectory. The shares gained 50% in 2019. The company has consistently beaten the expectations in the quarterly earnings reports.The numbers show that, as far as they can. In Q3 2019, the most recent reported, SBAC showed funds from operations (FFO – the REIT equivalent to earnings per share) of $2.15, opposed to the expected $2.08 and up 12% from the year-ago value. Revenues were equally strong. At $507.55 million, revenues were 2% higher than forecast, and up 8.6% year-over-year.This strong stock performance got Feldman’s full attention. He upgraded SBAC to a Buy rating, writing, “We expect acceleration in domestic organic leasing growth as carriers expand their 5G coverage and begin to overlay mid-band spectrum, and as SBAC sees a material decline in M&A driven churn. We estimate that over the next five years, SBAC can repurchase $7.1bn of stock and return $1.3bn in dividends to shareholders, while maintaining leverage at 7.0x net debt/EBITDA.”Feldman put a $280 price target on SBAC, indicating room for 12% growth in the next 12 months.SBA gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 2 Buys and 1 Hold. The relatively small number of reviews reflects the ‘under the radar’ profile of most REITs in the markets; these stocks, while frequently strong on fundamentals, tend to get passed over in favor of bigger, flashier companies. Shares in SBAC sell for $248, and the $261.33 average price target suggests a modest 5% upside potential. (See SBA stock analysis at TipRanks)American Tower Corporation (AMT)The second stock on our list takes the tower-oriented REIT model a step up in size. American Tower is another owner/operator of wireless infrastructure – but this company has a $103 billion market cap and a global investment footprint. AMT owns over 170,000 telecom infrastructure sites. The company’s portfolio includes over 75,000 sites in Asia, 40,000 in the US, and 37,000 in Latin America. Another 16,000 sites in Europe, Africa, and the Mid-East round out AMT’s holdings.The full-year 2019 numbers are not available yet, but the value of the tower-oriented REIT is shown by AMT’s $7.44 billion in 2018 revenues. The most recent quarterly on record is from Q3, and shows a $2 FFO, 2% over expectation, and revenues of $1.95 billion, a 5% forecast beat. Both FFO and revenues were up significantly year-over-year. In reaction, AMT showed a 49% share appreciation last year.Feldman writes of AMT, “We believe that AMT should trade at a signiﬁcant premium to the median of high-quality REITs… We have also increased the terminal growth rate … to reﬂect our view that the 5G cycle is likely to support leasing activity well beyond our 5-year forecasting period.”In line with his upbeat outlook on the company, Feldman gave AMT shares his second upgrade – to a Buy rating. His $270 price target implies an upside potential of 15%.Like SBAC, American Tower has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. This is based on 6 reviews, including 4 Buys and 2 Holds. The $243.83 average price target suggests an upside of 4% from the $233 current trading price. (See American Tower’s stock analysis at TipRanks)Verizon Communications (VZ)With Verizon, the third stock on our list, we shift gears from wireless infrastructure to a major wireless provider. Verizon is the second largest US wireless services company, by subscriber count, with over 118 million customers as of September 2019. The company’s $130 billion in 2018 revenue shows the both the size and income potential of the mobile market in the US.Verizon hasn’t seen the magnitude of gains that the tower REITs have, but the growth in wireless has given a boost to the company’s top and bottom lines. Revenues in Q3 last year were $32.9 billion, a half percent above the forecast, and the $1.25 EPS was 1% above the estimates. In a key metric – net retail additions – the 601,000 reported was up more than double year-over-year.Solid quarterly results and a firm position in a growth market attracted Feldman to Verizon. In his comments on Verizon, he writes, “How much could 5G boost postpaid ARPU/ARPA? Our analysis of Verizon’s unlimited pricing implies that its consumer accounts with unlimited plans generate monthly ARPA (average revenue per account) that is 11-48% higher than its reported consumer ARPA of $113.39 in 3Q19… [We see] signiﬁcant revenue growth opportunity for Verizon if the 5G upgrade cycle does indeed stimulate more customers to upgrade to unlimited plans, or to migrate to higher unlimited tiers.”Feldman reiterates his Buy rating on this stock, and raised his price target by 3% to $67. His new price target implies an upside for the stock of 7.6% in the coming 12 months. (To watch Feldman’s track record, click here)Like the two stocks above, Verizon holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating. In the case of VZ, this rating is based on 4 Buy and 6 Holds given in the past 3 months. Shares are selling for $59.04, and the average price target of $63.56 suggests an upside of ~8%.

2019-11-05	2019-11-05 18:16:29	SBAC	SBA Communications Corporation	5 REITs That Make the Cloud Pay You Dividends	Most investors know about tech stocks that have harnessed the cloud for growth, such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Amazon.com (AMZN).But are you familiar with the cloud's landlords?&quot;Cloud czars&quot; don't operate entirely on their own. There's a huge industry in connecting these clouds to each other, and to large and small customers alike. It requires cell towers, data centers and other communications technology.A number of real estate investment trusts (REITs) specialize in properties and other assets that ensure your tablet can stream Netflix (NFLX) content and that your company's data is secured in the cloud. As a reminder: REITs are a special type of business structure - one that requires at least 90% of taxable income be paid out to shareholders as dividends, in exchange for generous tax benefits.Many of these stocks have risen by leaps and bounds in 2019, though they're getting expensive as a result. Still, they sit smack-dab in the middle of a growth industry, and some of them remain valuable as takeover targets. Private equity firms EQT Partners and Digital Colony Partners bought fiber network owner Zayo Group for $8 billion in May. And in October, Digital Realty Trust (DLR) bought European data center giant Interxion (INXN) for $8.4 billion.Here are five REITs that can help you squeeze dividends out of the cloud. If you're looking for a broad-based play on the industry, the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate ETF (SRVR) invests in 20 such companies. However, these five holdings stand out among the rest. SEE ALSO: 20 Dividend Stocks to Fund 20 Years of Retirement	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-reits-cloud-pay-dividends-181629350.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-20	2019-08-20 19:36:06	SBAC	SBA Communications Corporation	7 Unusual, Growth-Oriented REITs to Buy for Your Portfolio	In a low interest rate environment, dividend stocks often come into focus. One type of dividend stock that gets attention is the real estate investment trust (REIT). To gain this status, companies must pay at least 90% of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Consequently, investors often look for REITs to buy because such rules lead to higher interest rates. Average yields for REITs have now climbed to 4.06%, more than double the average return of the S&P 500.  * 10 Stocks That Every 30-Year-Old Should Buy and Hold Forever Investors should also note that REITs remain a dynamic sector. For example, the advent of e-commerce has hurt retail REITs and boosted industrial REITs as a large portion of retailing moved from malls to warehouses. Also, new REIT sectors sometimes emerge. For example, data center REITs came about to meet the demand for cool, wired, secured real estate to store IT equipment. Such changes bring about new REITs to buy, and these stocks offer opportunities in such emerging industries.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust (CORR)Source: Shutterstock CorEnergy (NYSE:CORR) owns the infrastructure that runs the oil and gas industry. This includes structures such as pipelines, storage terminals and other transmission and distribution-related assets.Interestingly, as oil and gas prices struggle to gain traction, CORR stock remains one of the REITs to buy as its rise continues in this challenging environment. It now trades at just over $45 per share, a high not seen since 2012. Despite this increase, it trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 19.5.Moreover, the recent slump has not hurt profit growth. Wall Street predicts CORR stock will see profits grow by 9.3% and 23.9% next year before a slowdown in subsequent years.However, this could boost an already generous dividend payment. Right now, CORR stock pays out $3 per share. That yields around 6.6%. Although it has not risen since 2016, the current pace of profit growth could force it higher.After the current run-up, both revenue and profit growth could plateau. However, it should level off at a point that will still yield current investors a high dividend return. Crown Castle (CCI)Source: iStockphoto Among REITs to buy, Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) specializes in what many call &quot;vertical real estate.&quot; It owns towers throughout the world that make wireless communication possible. CNN Business's Paul R. La Monica went so far to label Crown Castle and peers American Tower (NYSE:AMT) and SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC) as the &quot;real winners&quot; of 5G. SBA's CEO expects 5G to provide his industry with &quot;multiple years of solid customer demand and strong growth.&quot;Hence, it should come as no surprise that CCI stock has risen to about $144 per share. It has increased by about 40% over the last year. Admittedly, this has made CCI a pricey stock as it trades at a forward P/E ratio of about 69.4.However, for this price, investors can expect to derive both significant growth and income. Analysts predict average profit growth of 21% per year over the next five years.  * 7 Fintech ETFs to Buy Now for Fabulous Financial Exposure The dividend has also risen consistently after becoming a REIT in 2014. Investors currently receive $4.50 per year in payouts. This brings its dividend yield to just over 3.1%, higher than either AMT or SBAC stock. Thanks to the 5G buildout, these payouts should continue to grow for years to come. Essential Properties Realty Trust (EPRT)Source: Shutterstock Essential Properties Realty Trust (NYSE:EPRT) has only traded for a little over one year. However, this diversified REIT, which specializes in properties with one tenant, has already delivered huge returns for its investors. Restaurants, movie theaters and vet clinics are among the property types it owns.It debuted at $14 per share in June 2018. Although it saw little price action in 2018, its growth in 2019 has made it one of the best REITs to buy. After last Christmas, it began a steady rise which has now taken it north of $22 per share.But can that continue for EPRT stock?Quite possibly, yes. The move higher took its forward P/E ratio to about 34. That may seem elevated. However, with average profit growth estimated at 34.61% per year over the next five years, that multiple appears reasonable.EPRT stock pays 88 cents per share in dividends. Despite the run-up, that amounts to a yield of around 4%. As a young company, it has only made four quarterly dividend payments in its history. While that has shown no increase, the profit growth rate will force that payout to move higher. As long as that growth continues at its current pace, I think EPRT stock will continue its move higher. Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)Source: Shutterstock Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) came about due to the emerging marijuana industry. This has created the need for spaces that provide ideal growing conditions for marijuana. This demand has gone ever higher due to hemp attaining legal status and cannabidiol (CBD) flying off store shelves.This company owns 21 properties specifically designed for producing cannabis. Over the last two years, IIPR stock has boomed. The yield of about 2.25% may look low by REIT standards; however, these payouts continue to rise. Two years ago, IIPR stock paid shareholders 15 cents per share in dividends every quarter. Now, the quarterly payout has increased to 60 cents per share.Furthermore, stock price appreciation has seen nearly as much growth. It traded below $20 per share in late 2017. Today it has risen to about $106 per share as of the time of this writing. Moreover, unlike most marijuana stocks now, it trades near its all-time high.  * The 10 Best Marijuana Stocks to Buy Now To be sure, IIPR stock carries with it more risk. The forward P/E ratio has risen to 35.6. That comes in low for a cannabis stock, but high for a REIT. However, Wall Street forecasts earnings increases of 128% this year and 74.3% in fiscal 2020. As long as the cannabis industry continues to see massive growth, IIPR stock should follow suit. Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI)Source: Shutterstock Omega Healthcare (NYSE:OHI) should make REITs to buy lists for demographics as much as any company-related factor. All things healthcare continue to benefit from the fact that about 10,000 baby boomers per day age into Medicare. Between their growing need for healthcare and help to pay through Medicare, the demand for healthcare-related facilities continues to rise.Consequently, analysts project a 10% earnings increase for Omega this year. Over the next five years, they believe average profit growth will rise to 15.8%. This will significantly boost the dividend for OHI stock as it has in past years.That said, investors should treat this as an income stock. Admittedly, the stock price has seen little growth over the last five years. In August 2014, it traded near the $36 per share level. Today, OHI stock sells for just over $39 per share. Moreover, the forward P/E ratio of almost 23 does not make this REIT cheap.Still, the payout should more than compensate for these shortcomings. The current annual dividend stands at $2.64 per share, a yield of almost 6.75%. Over time, this payout tends to rise steadily. Although it has not increased since the beginning of 2018, the increasing profit should keep the payout moving higher. These profit increases and the demographic trend backing them up make OHI stock one of the better REITs to buy for the foreseeable future. Ryman Hospitality (RHP)Source: FlickrAlthough many may not recognize the Ryman Hospitality (NYSE:RHP) name, they do know its flagship property, Nashville's Gaylord Opryland Resort. They also own four other Gaylord resort properties spread across the country. The company also owns several entertainment venues in Nashville and two others outside of the area.Investors should place RHP stock on their REITs to buy list, not so much for its excitement, but a track record of mostly steady growth. The stock price has nearly doubled in value over the last five years. Shrinking profits likely contributed to a slight decline in RHP over the previous year.However, this may have given investors a buying opportunity. RHP stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of about 25.3, thanks to a temporary drop in annual profits. However, after this year, Wall Street predicts an average earnings growth rate of 15.51% for the next five years.  * 7 Marijuana Penny Stocks That I May Buy Since its second REIT dividend payment in 2013, the payout has steadily increased. It now pays shareholders $3.60 per year for a yield of just over 4.3%. As the valuation falls and profits and dividends increase, long-term investors should continue to benefit from both a growth and an income standpoint. Safehold, Inc. (SAFE)Source: Shutterstock Safehold (NYSE:SAFE) has become one of the REITs to buy for its unique take on property ownership. It specializes in ground leases. They buy the property under the building, leasing it back to the building owner. This unlocks the value of the property under buildings, allowing property holders to hold less equity and push cash to use in other areas. The REIT has applied this strategy to multiple property types.Since launching their IPO in 2017, SAFE stock and its dividend initially struggled. Moreover, the dividend yield of about 2.1% has remained below REIT averages. However, the stock began to appreciate in 2019. Now trading at about $29 per share, SAFE has appreciated by about 80% since January. Also, the company raised the annual dividend by 2 cents per share in July.Those increases should continue. Wall Street also predicts profit growth for the next five years will average 42.6% per year. Furthermore, despite this massive growth, it still sells for a forward multiple of about 22.2. As long as SAFE stock can maintain this pace of profit growth, shareholders should benefit from not only the dividend but also a continually rising stock price.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.
