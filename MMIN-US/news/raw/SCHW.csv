2021-04-13	2021-04-13 20:57:06	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Schwab Accidentally Puts $1.2 Million Into Customer’s Fidelity Account	(Bloomberg) -- It’s not quite the nearly $1 billion blunder that Citigroup Inc. made last summer, but Charles Schwab Corp. said it accidentally sent more than $1 million to the Fidelity Brokerage Services account of a woman in Louisiana.Schwab blamed an “issue created by a software enhancement” for erroneously transferring $1.2 million in February to the Fidelity account of Kelyn Spadoni, rather than the $82.56 she had requested, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court in New Orleans last month. When the company realized the mistake and attempted to take the money back, it was gone and Spadoni wasn’t answering her phone, the bank said.After a month of failed attempts to recover the cash, Schwab filed a criminal complaint on April 6, Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Captain Jason Rivarde said. Spadoni, 33, was arrested the next day in Harvey, Louisiana, on charges of bank fraud, theft and illegal transmission of monetary funds, he said. She’d transferred about $350,000 into another account and used it to buy a 2021 Hyundai Genesis sport-utility vehicle and a home, Rivarde said.“The vast majority of the missing money has been recovered at this point by the seizure of the vehicle and the reversal of the house sale,” Rivarde said.Spadoni was fired from her job as a 911 dispatcher in the parish, Rivarde said. She was released April 8 on a bail bond, court records show.Schwab didn’t respond to an email and phone call. A message left for Spadoni at a number listed for her wasn’t returned.Schwab’s mistake is among the technical blunders -- such as misplaced decimal points and “fat finger” errors -- that financial firms dread. But it’s a trifle compared to the goof by Citigroup last summer. The bank meant to make an interest payment to Revlon Inc. lenders and instead wired them the principal, too, totaling $900 million. A judge later ruled many of the lenders could keep the money, though that decision is on appeal.But Citigroup’s misadventure pales in comparison the error made in 2018 by Deutsche Bank AG, which inadvertently transferred 28 billion euros ($33.4 billion) to one of its outside accounts.The Schwab story was originally reported by nola.com and WVUE-TV.The case is Charles Schwab v. Spadoni, 21-cv-635, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).(Updates with comment from law enforcement in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-accidentally-put-1-2-155112727.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-05	2021-04-05 16:50:10	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Goldman Sachs Adds Charles Schwab To Conviction List As Retail Trading Frenzy Continues	Shares of Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) traded higher on Monday after a Wall Street analyst added the stock to his Conviction Buy list. The Analyst: Goldman Sachs analyst Will Nance added Buy-rated Charles Schwab to Goldman’s Conviction List and raised his price target from $67 to $77. The Thesis: In the new note, Nance said retail investor market engagement has surprisingly increased so far in 2021. The interest rate environment has also improved significantly, supporting net interest margins. Goldman Sachs is currently forecasting two interest rate hikes in 2022, which will further improve Schwab’s potential earnings power. “On the back of the considerable momentum for fundamentals, we are adding SCHW to the Conviction List, as the stock has lagged considerable improvements in reinvestment rates, and this combined with robust balance sheet growth is likely to continue to propel forward estimates and the stock in our view,” Nance said. Related Link: Beginning Investor? Here's How To Protect Your Portfolio In 2021 Goldman is calling for first-quarter adjusted EPS of 78 cents, slightly ahead of consensus analyst estimates of 74 cents. Given short-term interest rates remain near zero and Schwab has underperformed relative to the improving environment so far in 2021, Nance said that Schwab could see significant near-term upside as the stock re-rates toward the higher end of its historical valuation range. For now, the biggest risk for broker stock investors is the “inevitable decline” in retail trading activity, Nance said. Nance is also calling for 94 cents in first-quarter EPS from Neutral-rated Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: IBKR), ahead of consensus estimates of 72 cents. Benzinga’s Take: The frenzy of retail trading activity driven by a booming stock market and a global pandemic has created a near-perfect storm for brokers. Additional upside will likely hinge on retail traders maintaining their enthusiasm for stock trading once the economy starts to open back up and the potential for further upside in interest rates.

2021-03-15	2021-03-15 08:50:55	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Charles Schwab’s Feb. Brokerage Accounts & Client Assets Climb	Charles Schwab, a financial services company, released its activity report for Feb. 2021, and in response, shares rose 1.9% to close at $67.65 on March 12. Schwab (SCHW) opened 1,211,000 new brokerage accounts in February, which more than tripled from the 159,000 new accounts reported in Feb. 2020. Accounts also rose 11% from the prior month. The company’s active brokerage accounts came in at 31.5 million at February-end, up 3% from January and 152% from the prior-year month. Further, corporate retirement plan participants were 2.1 million, up 1% from the prior month and 21% year-over-year. The number of clients’ banking accounts was 1.5 million at the end of February, increasing 2% from Jan. 2021 and 9% from Feb. 2020. (See Schwab stock analysis on TipRanks) On top of this, Schwab’s total client assets came in at $6.9 trillion, up 2% from the prior month and 79% from Feb. 2020. Net new assets were $37 billion, up 8% from Jan. 2021 and 52% year-over-year. Schwab’s CFO Peter Crawford commented, “While retail trading activity overall has been increasing since Schwab helped lead the industry to $0 commissions1 in October 2019, the effects of work-from-home, technology-driven enhancements in access to information, and the increased convenience of stock-trading have further heightened investor engagement.” “Most recently, the added accelerant of social media-influenced trading has led to a massive surge in interactions for brokerage firms and helped push equity trading volumes to truly breathtaking heights – well beyond the pre-pandemic peak reached during the 2008 financial crisis,” Crawford added. On March 4, J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Worthington initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $79 (16.8% upside potential). Worthington views “Schwab as a leader in retail brokerage, with growth opportunities that leverage changes to structure or leverage secular trends that should drive earnings growth for multiple years.” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 9 analysts suggesting a Buy and 4 analysts recommending a Hold. The average analyst price target of $68.04 implies that shares are almost fully valued at current levels. Shares have appreciated 28.2% so far this year.

The company said core net new assets brought to Schwab in February totaled $51.4 billion. Total client assets were $6.90 trillion at the end of February, up 79% from a year ago, as the S&P 500 climbed 29.0% over the same time. ""While retail trading activity overall has been increasing since Schwab helped lead the industry to $0 commissions in October 2019, the effects of work-from-home, technology-driven enhancements in access to information, and the increased convenience of stock-trading have further heightened investor engagement,"" said Chief Financial Officer Peter Crawford. ""Most recently, the added accelerant of social media-influenced trading has led to a massive surge in interactions for brokerage firms and helped push equity trading volumes to truly breathtaking heights - well beyond the pre-pandemic peak reached during the 2008 financial crisis."" Schwab's stock has soared 133.6% over the past 12 months, while the S&P 500 has advanced 58.8%."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/91f72a93-b2b0-318f-80ee-acb5e1795ff5/schwab-new-brokerage-accounts.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-10	2021-03-10 23:15:45	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Schwab, TD Ameritrade Experts Talk Retail Trader Sentiment, Inflation, Reopening Plays	The stock market has experienced some extreme volatility in recent weeks, but JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief market strategist, says retail traders have still been buying stocks. In fact, they increased their exposure to equities by about 10% overall in February, Kinahan said during an online discussion on Wednesday with Randy Frederick, VP of trading and derivatives at the Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) Center for Financial Research. Kinahan and Frederick weighed in on what stocks retail traders are buying and selling, what the next market catalysts could be and concerns over rising interest rates and inflation. What Traders Are Buying: “Clients are taking more exposure to the market overall,” Kinahan said. “When we have sell-offs, particularly in technology, clients will go to the FAANG stocks.” Since Feb. 1, Alphabet, Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been the only FAANG stock to outperform the overall market. Kinahan said Ameritrade users have been most aggressively buying Apple, Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA). Since the beginning of February, Apple shares are down 10.3% and Tesla shares are down 19%. “Our clients still believe in the long-term story of those stocks,” Kinahan said. At the same time, Kinahan said clients have been selling vaccine plays, such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA). Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM) and other work-from-home stocks are also experiencing selling pressure, he said: “Maybe they need another catalyst to continue that run.” Related Link: How To Prepare For The First Bear Market Of Your Trading Career Inflation, Housing Concerns: It’s understandable that investors are monitoring inflation numbers closely given the unprecedented government stimulus measures in the last year, said Frederick. Yet there are different types of inflation, and it’s not necessarily bad for the market, he said. Inflation based on economic strength can be healthy for the market, and Frederick said economists are projecting some spectacular growth numbers for the U.S. economy in 2021. “What I see is inflation for the right reasons, not inflation for the wrong reasons,” he said. It’s been so long since there has been real inflation that some investors are freaking out about potential inflation that is still relatively modest compared to other periods in the past, Frederick said. When it comes to market risk, Frederick said he believes the U.S. housing market has become a bit overheated. In his local area, he said he’s seen indications of as much as a 16% rise in prices in the last year. Frederick, Kinahan's Reopening Plays: While reopening stocks could get a big boost in the next couple of quarters, Frederick said the services industry will likely lag other rebound stocks. While many companies will experience pent-up demand from the shutdown, Frederick said there’s a cap to how much people will spend on restaurant dining and services such as salons and spas. “That’s an area where you’re going to have a much longer run-up to get back to normal than other areas,” he said. While services industries may struggle in 2021, Kinahan said banks could surprise to the upside. Banks have adapted in the last decade and found a way to generate record profits during a period of historically low interest rates, he said. Once those rates start to rise again, banks could be flooded with profits, and ETFs like the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSE: KBE) could take off, Kinahan said: “The financials I think have a great runway.” Finally, Kinahan said investors should be watching employment numbers closely, but shouldn’t put too much weight on individual reports. “Look for a trend, and the trend is a very positive one,” he said.

2021-02-24	2021-02-24 20:25:25	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Sudden Demise of $1.8 Billion Fund Points to Long-Feared Danger	(Bloomberg) -- An early sign of trouble for James Velissaris’s complex mutual fund emerged in the waning days of a chaotic year.Investors in his $1.8 billion fund at Infinity Q Capital Management received a message in December that it would stop accepting new money at month’s end. Customers would be notified as soon as it re-opened.That day never came. The short advisory belied the turmoil still coming for the Infinity Q Diversified Alpha Fund and its founder. This week the firm shut the fund and relieved Velissaris of his duties after federal regulators raised concerns that he may have tampered with valuations on derivative investments.It’s an abrupt turn for a money manager who earned the financial backing of billionaire David Bonderman, co-founder of private equity firm TPG Capital. It also cuts to the heart of an issue the Securities and Exchange Commission has long fretted about: While derivatives in the plain-vanilla world of so-called ’40 Act mutual funds can boost returns, the complex instruments may not be appropriate for retail investors because they can increase risk and be difficult to price.In the case of Infinity Q, a significant portion of the mutual fund’s shares were owned by clients of brokerage giant Charles Schwab Corp., a filing shows.Infinity Q’s announcement Monday that it’s freezing redemptions is highly unusual for the industry -- akin to an earthquake in its rarity and significance. The firm said it may take “several days or weeks” to figure out how to value swaps that account for about 18% of the fund’s reported assets after learning that Velissaris had allegedly accessed and altered a third party’s valuation models for the instruments. His attorneys have said he acted in good faith and will continue to do so.“These are pretty unique instruments to be used in a ’40 Act mutual fund product,” said Bobby Blue, an analyst in the multi-asset and alternatives manager research group at Morningstar Inc. “It’s a lot of complexity for the typical retail investor, which is obviously who this is being marketed to.”The SEC has long grappled with whether and how to restrict the growing popularity of derivatives in funds that, governed by the Investment Company Act of 1940, offer investors daily access to their savings. “Alternative” mutual funds proliferated in the years after the 2008 financial crisis as investors hurt by that tumult sought to diversify beyond traditional stocks and bonds, embracing illiquid assets and complex strategies used by hedge funds.Bonderman BackingVelissaris set up his mutual fund business in 2014 with Bonderman’s backing. The idea was to offer an alternatives strategy underpinned by quant models, potentially using derivatives and borrowed money, but still letting investors withdraw on a daily basis.In December 2015, the SEC proposed rules to limit how much mutual funds could wager with derivatives. That regulation was never finalized. Then last year, the agency rolled out a revised and less restrictive approach that gave managers 18 months to comply. It also passed rules for valuing assets, with a similarly long deadline. That means Infinity Q and other funds aren’t yet required to meet the new policies for risk management and board oversight of valuations.The Infinity Q episode underscores dangers that have long lurked for individual investors in funds using complex products and pricing. When the SEC informed Infinity Q of suspected irregularities, the agency was acting out of concern that investors could be harmed, according to people familiar with the matter.“This kind of situation is pretty unusual,” said David Grim, a former head of the SEC division that oversees the mutual fund industry who’s now a partner at Stradley Ronon Stevens & Young. Mutual funds can’t suspend redemptions without the agency’s blessing, he noted, and “the SEC doesn’t grant that relief very often because that right is so fundamental to what it means to be a mutual fund investor.”One of the best-known examples of such a move was in 2015, when Third Avenue Management, founded by Martin Whitman, suspended redemptions at a $788 million mutual fund that specialized in high-yield bonds. The move rattled credit markets and led to the departure of David Barse as chief executive officer. The episode still comes up at industry gatherings.Swift RiseVelissaris, a former Harvard University football player, ascended swiftly in the world of money management, clinching support for a venture of his own by age 30.He had spent some of his formative years in the industry at Arden Asset Management, joining the fund of funds in 2008, a period when firms were adjusting to heightened investor scrutiny. In 2012 he joined Wildcat Capital Management, originally Bonderman’s family office, working as a portfolio manager.When Velissaris formed Infinity Q, Bonderman’s money helped it get started. That association featured in marketing. Until earlier this month, the “About Us” page of Infinity Q’s website began with the sentence: “Infinity Q Capital Management is a pioneering investment advisor managed by David Bonderman’s family office.”Then last week, according to a company statement, the SEC told the firm’s non-executive chairman that it had information showing Velissaris adjusted models used to price swap contracts held by the diversified fund, likely resulting in incorrect valuations being reported to investors.“David Bonderman is a passive investor in a family investment vehicle which, in turn, made a $2 million non-control investment in Infinity Q Capital Management, and made passive investments in Infinity Q’s funds,” a spokesman for Wildcat said in an emailed statement. “Mr. Bonderman and his family investment vehicle have never had any input, oversight, or participation in investment decisions or investment reporting by Infinity Q.”Velissaris’s lawyers reiterated in a statement via a spokeswoman for this story that “his focus has always been on delivering and preserving value for investors.”The fund has noted in disclosures that it may sometimes use additional discretion around pricing, in cases where dependable market quotes are unavailable or when a security’s “fair value” isn’t reflected in valuations provided by its pricing service.Promising UpdatesInfinity Q Diversified Alpha Fund did better than most peers, returning 4.87% on a three-year annualized basis through Thursday, Bloomberg data show. That placed it in the 70th percentile of similar funds -- but still far behind the S&P 500 Index.A regulatory filing in May shows Charles Schwab clients owned 23.67 million of the fund’s institutional shares, or 27.3%. The brokerage’s customers also held 2.1 million of the fund’s retail shares, or 64.7%. Schwab said in an emailed statement that it’s “committed to timely, transparent communication with our clients as we learn more.”Signs of mistakes emerged months later. One filing from Infinity Q Diversified Alpha’s fiscal year at the end of August showed the fund had to recalculate its net asset value at some point during the period.Then this week, the company’s website went into “maintenance mode” as the fund froze. The site has since gotten an overhaul. On Wednesday, it offered a statement to customers on the suspended redemption, promising updates with press releases and “periodic reports.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sudden-demise-1-8-billion-202525945.html?.tsrc=rss

The week's bullish calls included a rebounding entertainment giant, a well-positioned homebuilder and a retail giant with prospects. An EV maker facing softening demand and a couple of overvalued stocks were among the bearish calls seen. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 ended the past week more or less flat, while the Nasdaq slipped less than 2%. It was a week that started with a major winter storm that slammed parts of the country not prepared for such weather, likely resulting in a long recovery and widespread fallout. While the WallStreetBets crowd may have moved on, the recent short squeeze drama has drawn attention from Congress, regulators and the courts. Bitcoin (BTC) continued to soar last week, and with it speculation about where the cryptocurrency is headed. On the pandemic front, as another COVID-19 vaccine nears approval, concerns about shortages and fears about new variants of the disease linger. Note that the leading electric vehicle maker has slashed prices on some models and has refreshed others. Conventional automakers (and notable others) are intent on raising their EV game as well. However, it seems a scarcity of semiconductors has pit automakers against smartphone makers. And this past week, Wall Street got a look at what Warren Buffett and other big investors have been doing with their portfolios. Through it all, Benzinga continued to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week's most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look. Bulls ""Why 4 Analysts Think Disney Can Thrive Now And After The Pandemic"" by Melanie Schaffer examines why Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) could see strong growth in 2021 from demand in two main areas.

2021-02-20	2021-02-20 09:30:00	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Tencent alumnus aims to turn Futu into China's Charles Schwab, even as it lands in Robinhood's 'Nerd vs Wall Street' battle	"In late January, when the ""Nerds vs Wall Street"" battle was at its most intense on the New York Stock Exchange, one of China's most promising technology entrepreneurs was catching very few winks 13 hours away in Shenzhen. Li Hua, who also goes by ""Leaf"", personally negotiated with his dealers in the United States to unfreeze transactions so that customers of Futu Holdings' internet-only trading platform in mainland China and Hong Kong could join in the chase for the shares of GameStop, an unprofitable retailer of speciality electronic games in Grapevine, Texas. The GameStop mania wiped out US$27 billion of value in a boom-to-bust cycle in less than a month. It dragged Futu into the limelight along with the largest no-commission online broker Robinhood, when Li's customers were barred from buying additional shares in GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings. Even though the suspension was eased within 24 hours, the episode drew an uncomfortable comparison with Robinhood, which sells customers' online orders to high-frequency brokers or market makers like Citadel Securities. Li, founder of Futu, had envisioned creating China's Charles Schwab when he established the online broker in 2012. Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China. ""We are not like [Robinhood] because they sell order flows in exchange for letting customers trade for free,"" Li said in an interview with South China Morning Post in Shenzhen. ""That's not a business [model] that we are getting involved in, at least for now."" Futu Holdings founder and chairman Leaf Li Hua poses for a picture at the company's head office in Shenzhen on December 9, 2020. Photo: Iris Ouyang Futu is the biggest in a new crop of stockbrokers in China that exist 100 per cent online, eschewing the type of bricks-and-mortar trading halls and viewing galleries frequented by the nation's legions of pensioner investors. The number of China's share-trading accounts ballooned to 178 million in December, according to China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation, making this the world's eighth-largest cluster of people behind Nigeria's population. ""Online stock trading in China topped the world in 2018 with 31 per cent of the market, showing the steadily rising demand of investors using online channels for their transactions,"" according to First Shanghai Securities' analyst Li Jinglin, in a January 22 report. ""Compared with traditional brokerages with bricks-and-mortar shops, online brokers that focus on online trading have improved efficiency, relatively lower commission rates and fees after they cut their overheads, and they are better able to win over loyal customers with their cost advantage."" Headquarter of Futu Holdings in Shenzhen on December 9, 2020. Photo: Iris Ouyang Comprising mostly millennials who came of age in 2000 or even some Gen Z traders born in the 21st century, these young customers prefer simple, do-it-yourself systems that let them trade from the convenience of their ubiquitous smartphones. Lower transaction fees were also a big plus, encouraging more traders to get in and out of positions more frequently, even with smaller wins. ""The simplicity of our service enables us to cater to all levels of customers, whether they are beginners, or experienced investors who require more in-depth features and analysis,"" Li said at his head office on Yuehai Street, one of China's wealthiest neighbourhoods measured by gross domestic product. The street, cutting through the Nanshan district in the heart of what is dubbed ""China's Silicon Valley,"" is the marquee address for the technology industry, home to such home-grown champions as Huawei Technologies, ZTE, Tencent Holdings and the drone maker DJI. A night view of Nanshan district in Shenzhen, with Tencent Holdings' building in the centre, on October 7, 2020. Photo: Xinhua The simplicity of the model served Li well, helping Futu chalk up 10.4 million user accounts as of September 30, 10 times larger than Tiger Brokers - backed by one of China's largest smartphone makers Xiaomi - with 1 million user accounts at the end of November. Futu's commission is 0.05 per cent, with the minimum amount set at HK$50 (US$6.4) except for new users in certain periods, compared with 0.03 per cent in commission fees plus 0.03 per cent platform fees by Tiger Brokers, and 0.25 per cent by Huatai International with a minimum amount of HK$100. A decade earlier, when Li had just struck out on his own, stockbroking was a different business. Dominated by brokerages affiliated with large state-owned banks, the industry was a tightly regulated market heavily ring-fenced by rules to damp price swings, prevent capital flight and provide the population a one-way bet for ever higher prices. It was also a business that was in no rush to innovate. Investors domiciled in mainland China, collectively sitting on the world's largest currency reserves, had few avenues for trading offshore due to the nation's tightly controlled capital accounts. Until a cross-border investment channel called the Connect was established with Hong Kong in 2014, they could not trade any of the Chinese companies listed on the city's exchange, from state companies such as China Mobile Limited to tech champions such as Tencent. Trading of US-listed stocks was off-limits. Such was the market situation that drew Li, who turns 44 this year, to abandon a promising career in what would become China's most valuable company to strike out on his own. Li, who studied computer science, joined Tencent in 2000, two years after graduating from Hunan University in central China. His English name Leaf is a homophone of his Chinese name in his native Changsha dialect. Joining the then start-up, Li worked alongside Tencent's founder Pony Ma Huateng, helping to develop the QQ messaging service that helped to connect people from far-flung regions around China. QQ, still in use today by 600 million active users every month, would turn out to be one of Tencent's most successful products. After two years of working on QQ, Li was promoted to head a division at Tencent charged with creating video content. Tencent went public in 2004, raising HK$1.79 billion in an initial public offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company's shares have jumped almost 200 times since going public, valuing Tencent at HK$7.08 trillion as the sixth-largest publicly traded company on earth. As a middle-ranking manager and one of the earliest employees - he was staff No. 18 - Li was rewarded with share options that turned into instant wealth. Tencent's listing in Hong Kong also gave Li an early peek at how the stock market worked, giving him first-hand experience of investing across different currencies and markets, as well as having to navigate different regulatory requirements. Frustrated with the prevailing stockbrokerage services that were cumbersome, expensive and inefficient, Li struck out to develop his own trading platform. He wanted to create a Chinese version of Charles Schwab, the pioneer of electronic trading platforms, discount brokers and no-fee trading that is now the world's third-largest asset manager behind BlackRock and Vanguard. He left Tencent in 2008 to focus on his venture, picking the date - four days after Valentine's Day - of his eighth anniversary as his last day at the company, according to his blog. He had not even told his parents about his resignation, causing them to wonder if he had been fired for misconduct, he wrote. The early days were hard, as he struggled to raise capital and to navigate the underdeveloped market for online stockbroking. ""If I was given another chance, I may not choose to start my own business,"" Li said. ""That's not to say I regret becoming an entrepreneur, but many things were far more difficult than I originally thought."" Three years would go by, before his product was ready to launch. For Futu to progress from vision to reality, Li said he had Tencent to thank, both for eight years of working in one of China's largest technology companies, and for its financial backing.

Contrary to global conventions, China uses green to denote losses and declines, using red colour to represent gains and advances. Photo: EPA-EFE ""Most people lack the ability to believe, especially the ability to believe in the future ... Many people believe it after they see it happen,"" he said, adding that his experience at Tencent made it ""very easy"" for him to believe the future. Tencent also became one of the earliest investors in Li's start-up. China's largest publicly traded company is now Futu's second-largest shareholder, owning 18.9 per cent of its class A shares an 25.9 per cent of Class B shares. Futu is the largest of a new crop of online brokerages that embraced the constantly changing needs of their users. Besides Xiaomi-backed Tiger Brokers, Ant Group - an affiliate of this newspaper's owner Alibaba Group Holding - also has an investment in Snowball Securities. Online brokers have disrupted the traditional brokerage segment over the years, benefiting from a surge in direct financing. China recorded double-digit growth in the number of securities apps users between December 2016 and July 2020, according to iMedia Research. SCMP Graphics Fintech institutions - those technology behemoths that are venturing into financial services, like Ant Group, Xiaomi and Tencent itself - will record a bigger growth as the trading volume of global capital markets grows, while people increasingly accept online trading amid technology development, said First Securities' Li. A lower growth of new users, lower-than-expected market activities and possibly tighter regulation could pose risks for Futu, the analyst said. ""Online brokers have the advantage in costs, so traditional brokers will lose their competence if they don't diversify their businesses,"" Futu's founder said. ""Their brand franchise, experience and the accumulation of human relations should be what they must focus on."" Futu now employs more than 1,300 around the world. Its stock has risen 15-fold since its 2019 initial public offering in New York, valuing the company at US$24.5 billion, about a fifth the capitalisation of Charles Schwab, founded half a century ago in 1971. The company's own fund, Futu Money Plus, managed more than HK$10 billion in capital at the end of 2020. GameStop's journey from boom to bust took less than a month. SCMP Graphics The company is making a push into the Singapore, using the country as its stepping stone to tap Southeast Asia, allowing Chinese investors to trade the region's stocks. Futu's growth has turned Li into China's 66th-weathiest billionaire, according to Bloomberg, estimating his fortunes at US$9.3 billion through a 40-per cent stake in Futu, making him the stockbroking industry's 11th-richest broker. Recriminations continue in the United States over the GameStop mania, with Robinhood's 34-year-old chief executive Vlad Tenev being called to testify to the US Congress this week about the temporary trading restriction placed on the stock. Thankfully for Li, Futu is spared the scrutiny. ""Futu is actively communicating with upstream channels to enhance trading channel capacity,"" Li said two weeks ago when the Chinese broker had to follow its US dealers in restricting transactions, adding that the company will continue to vet new customers before opening accounts and increase risk alerts to users. ""We are also planning a new round of capacity expansion in the Hong Kong market to ensure customers' orders are processed quickly and smoothly.""

2021-02-17	2021-02-17 23:17:35	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	4 Reasons This Analyst Is Bullish On Charles Schwab	Bank of America recently hosted a bull-bear debate on Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) and came out firmly on the bullish side of the camp. The Analyst: On Wednesday, Bank of America analyst Michael Carrier reiterated his Buy rating and $70 price target for Charles Schwab. The Thesis: During the debate, Carrier said Schwab bears raised some compelling points against the stock. Bears said retail engagement in the stock market is likely at or near peak levels. In addition, Schwab’s cash balances may start to level off, suggesting the company could have difficulty offsetting interest rate headwinds. In addition, the risk that regulators change the rules related to payment for order flow, following the recent WallStreetBets-driven market volatility, could force changes to Schwab’s business model. Despite the concerns, Carrier says he still sees more pros than cons to owning Schwab stock. “Despite some uncertainty around the surge in retail trading and potential regulatory topics/changes, as well as low short rates, we continue to like the outlook for SCHW and see multiple drivers of upside ahead,” he wrote. Related Link: How And Why Did The Stock Market Crack? He listed the following four reasons he’s bullish on Schwab: Retail investor engagement isn’t going away any time soon. There are plenty of expense synergies following the TD Ameritrade buyout. Schwab is still gaining market share due to its innovative products. Rising interest rates are a long-term bullish catalyst. Benzinga’s Take: By far the biggest risk Schwab faces in the near term would be a crackdown on payment for order flow. Schwab investors should pay close attention to Thursday’s Congressional hearing on the recent trading volatility in GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) that will include testimony from the CEOs of Reddit, Robinhood, Citadel Securities and Melvin Capital.

2021-02-04	2021-02-04 12:00:07	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Robinhood's Lucrative Options-Trading Platform Attracts Mounting Scrutiny	(Bloomberg) -- As one beleaguered stock after another suddenly soared in January, so too did queries on Google: “How to trade options on Robinhood.”Robinhood Markets’s options-trading platform, barely three years old, is charting a meteoric rise in the Covid-19 pandemic, establishing the firm as the venue of choice for throngs of retail investing enthusiasts.New disclosures show the app’s monthly volume of options executed tripled last year, making the firm the second-most active among peers behind Charles Schwab Corp., a 50-year-old stalwart that just bought TD Ameritrade. Offering options is so lucrative that they accounted for two-thirds of Robinhood’s reported revenue from order flow, a significant source of income. A single contract can generate more money than handling 100 shares.But with that windfall comes mounting scrutiny of the role no-fee brokerages played in January’s chaos and how stringently they vet newbies eager to make options trades, which can amplify returns but also exacerbate swings in market prices. Skeptics, lawmakers and regulators have been aiming pointed questions at Robinhood.Using its app, clients can unlock Robinhood’s most advanced level of options strategies in minutes by tapping their details into a smartphone. They can then instantly start placing wagers on some of the most complex U.S. markets available to the investing public. Approval for similar access can take days at competitors such as Schwab and Morgan Stanley’s E*Trade.Concerns about Robinhood’s screening of options investors arose following news in June of the suicide of a 20-year-old user, after he saw a more-than $700,000 negative balance while using the app to bet on the contracts, according to an account by a family member. The tragedy stirred a debate over whether Robinhood was letting clients take risks they didn’t comprehend, prompting U.S. lawmakers to send a letter underscoring its responsibility to safeguard investing rookies.Then in December, a Massachusetts financial watchdog blasted Robinhood’s screening of options applicants in a complaint the firm disputes. The office, overseen by Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, accused Robinhood of encouraging the “gamification” of investing and said that when it comes to enabling options, the brokerage failed to ensure clients met its own criteria.QuickTake: Robinhood’s Role in the ‘Gamification’ of Investing“Robinhood inappropriately, and in violation of company policy, approved customers for options trading despite those customers having no investment experience,” the regulator wrote in an administrative complaint.Fighting AllegationsIn a 50-page response to Galvin’s complaint last week, Robinhood said the office misunderstood the firm’s criteria for approval and that customers can be granted access if they say they have prior experience trading options. “When that information is considered, Robinhood believes all Massachusetts customers met the applicable options-trading criteria,” lawyers for the company wrote.Robinhood is “committed to providing the best investing experience,” the brokerage said in an emailed response to questions for this story. “While options trading is not unique to Robinhood, we’re proud to offer an intuitive and cost-effective platform to help people understand and trade options, including enhanced educational materials.”Options contracts give holders the right to buy or sell a stock at a specific price by a future date. The derivatives can be more lucrative than transacting in shares directly. That’s because the value of contracts can multiply while underlying stocks rise by mere percentage points. However, if shares don’t move as hoped, the contracts remain “out of the money” and can end up worthless.That danger, and the use of options in more complex strategies, are why industry regulators require brokerages to vet their customers. Firms typically adopt a system of risk levels, granting investors access based on factors including wealth and experience.‘You’re Level 3!’The popularity of Robinhood’s options platform exploded last year as millions of people opened accounts at the brokerage to pass time and earn money during lockdowns. By December, the monthly volume of contracts executed on its platform jumped 197% from the start of the year, dwarfing the 54% increase on Schwab and TD’s platforms combined, as well as a 46% rise at E*Trade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence from regulatory filings.The nominal increase in that activity at Robinhood also outpaced other firms, the data show.Applying for access to options on Robinhood’s app is relatively frictionless. After tapping “continue” on a few screens and setting profile parameters such as income and risk tolerance, the app greets entrants to its most advanced level with a green fireworks graphic and congratulatory message: “You’re Level 3! You can now trade vertical spreads, calendar spreads, iron condors and more.”In the Massachusetts complaint, Galvin said the firm granted more than 48,000 customers in his state some level of ability to trade options even though they had little or no investment experience. Robinhood wrote in its response that many customers approved for options don’t go on to trade them. While the firm has automated approvals, that system is overseen by a human, and afterward customers “are subject to review through manual spot checks,” the company said.Schwab, in contrast, says it deliberately takes time to vet customers. Applicants for every risk level must submit a form online or by mail for review by company personnel.“We’ve taken a conservative approach,” said Jeff Chiappetta, vice president of trading and education at Schwab. Approval won’t come “today or tomorrow,” he said. “There is a little bit of a time lapse.”Still, its TD Ameritrade business has automated at least some parts of the vetting process. The firm says humans are involved in reviewing permission for advanced options trading.Market ScrutinyFinancial watchdogs are ramping up scrutiny of retail investing after traders on Reddit and social media sent shares of GameStop Corp. and other companies skyrocketing in recent weeks, burning some hedge funds. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to meet with regulators Thursday to discuss the tumult’s implications for market efficiency and investor protection. Options trading is expected to face examination after the Securities and Exchange Commission vowed to root out any market manipulation.While options don’t drive prices in normal conditions, they can amplify sudden jumps if market makers deluged with orders for the contracts rush to hedge themselves against losses by buying shares. Over the past 10 days, an average of 1.1 million GameStop options contracts traded daily, more than 22 times what was typical in 2020.“Unquestionably, Robinhood has made it easy for ordinary people to open accounts, trade complex financial products and take significant financial risks -- but what are the consequences for investors and the markets overall?” said Tyler Gellasch, executive director of the Healthy Markets Association, an industry group representing large investors. “The SEC, exchanges and Congress are about to spend a lot of time really examining these issues.”Googling InstructionsTo be sure, there’s no public data showing how much specific brokerages were involved in options trades tied to GameStop and other volatile stocks. But there’s no doubt Robinhood’s users were betting on the surges.A variety of Google searches for trading options on Robinhood spiked to 12-month peaks in January. And an analysis by Atom Finance, an investment researcher, shows more than half of Atom users who traded at Robinhood on Jan. 27 were active in the volatile stocks the brokerage ended up restricting one day later. When Robinhood set out to reduce its exposure to those swings, it set limits on options contracts tied to those shares for days.Robinhood makes money on options by selling orders to high-speed traders, a common industry practice.Under the hood, its platform earned an average of about 64 cents per options contract executed in December, according to the data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence -- more than most major brokerages. In comparison, Robinhood earned about 36 cents for every 100 shares of S&P 500 companies that month.That’s made the burgeoning options platform key to the firm’s earnings. Options trading accounted for $440 million, or roughly two-thirds, of the company’s order-flow revenue from equities bets last year, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. The firm earns money in other ways too, such as from stock lending and subscriptions to its premium service.“The brilliance of Robinhood is they’ve created software that’s easy to use,” said Burton Malkiel, a professor emeritus of economics at Princeton University, who also serves as chief investment officer at robo adviser Wealthfront, another financial-technology firm. “They’ve been probably most successful in attracting these people who are swept up in the gambling pandemic.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhoods-lucrative-options-trading-platform-120007392.html?.tsrc=rss

What Happened: The pension fund added 999,948 shares of the Elon Musk-led company in the fourth quarter, while it did not own any at the end of the third quarter. The fund added 382,987 Schwab shares to bring its holdings up to approx. 1.82 million shares. At the same time, the pension fund shed shares of Intel Corporation (NYSE: INTC) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL). The teacher’s pension held almost 5.68 million shares of Intel at the end of the fourth quarter, while it had nearly 6.08 million shares at the end of the preceding quarter, having sold 404,751 shares. NYSTRS sold 289,217 shares of Oracle between the third and fourth quarters to bring its total holdings to nearly 2.6 million shares. Why It Matters: Wedbush analyst Dan Ives maintained his ,250 bull case target on Tesla in January, ahead of the company’s fourth-quarter earnings. See Also: Tesla Reports Record Quarterly Revenue Of .74B, Semi Deliveries Will Begin This Year Charles Schwab reported Q4 earnings per share of 74 cents, which beat analyst expectations of 71 cents per share. Schwab and TD Ameritrade merged in a billion all-stock deal in November last year. Intel, which is facing stiff competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), reported fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of .52 beating a .10 cents estimate. Price Action: On Friday in the regular session, Tesla shares closed nearly 5% lower at $793.53, Oracle shares closed almost 1.3% lower at $60.43, Intel shares closed almost 1% lower at $55.51, and Charles Schwab shares closed 4.09% lower at $51.54.

2021-01-29	2021-01-29 15:56:00	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Schwab clarifies 'confusion' over response to trading activity in stocks like GameStop, AMC and Express	"Charles Schwab Corp. issued Friday a statement, to clarify actions it has taken related to the recent frenzied trading activity stocks, such as those of GameStop Corp. , AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and Express Inc. , that have resulted from so-called ""short squeezes."" The discount broker said that given the ""confusion"" about what it and its recently acquired TD Ameritrade have done in response to the recent trading activity, Schwab said: ""Neither Charles Schwab & Co. nor TD Ameritrade halted buying or selling of ANY stocks this week. Neither firm restricted buying or selling basic options. Both firms did adjust margin requirements on select stocks to ensure clients had sufficient assets to pay for stock purchases. Both firms also restricted certain advanced options strategies."" For example, Schwab said it began on Jan. 13 the process of changing the margin requirement for GameStop's stock to 100%, which means Schwab's clients were restricted from using GameStop shares as collateral for a margin loan. Schwab's stock dropped 4.9% in morning trading Friday. It has lost 3.6% year to date, while the S&P 500 has edged up 0.2%."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/815376a5-1c5f-3d78-8b73-32b460b602b8/schwab-clarifies-%27confusion%27.html?.tsrc=rss

Robinhood Markets, Morgan Stanley’s E*Trade and Fidelity were also affected, according to Downdetector.com, which tracks user complaints.Schwab’s TD Ameritrade took the rare step of limiting some transactions on shares of GameStop, AMC and others. The firm said high volume may have curtailed access to its mobile app and urged clients to use its other platforms.“We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors,” TD Ameritrade spokeswoman Margaret Farrell said in an email.Robinhood said it managed to resolve problems with its web app, while Schwab said some clients were struggling with online trading because of a technical issue.Read more: GameStop Rally Hits New Extremes as Short Sellers SurrenderSchwab clients were experiencing trouble amid “heightened trading across the market,” spokeswoman Mayura Hooper said in an email.Spokeswomen for Schwab and Fidelity said the companies had resolved the issues with their platforms.

2021-01-24	2021-01-24 12:30:00	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Thanks, Robinhood, but These Traders Now Want Professional Help	(Bloomberg) -- The age of coronavirus lockdowns helped fuel a blistering rise in retail trading, and many rookies even beat the market. But day traders also found that the year’s market gyrations required constant attention and that their amateur trading tools were limited.So many do-it-yourself investors have decided that they need professional help.Jeremy Johnson, a 31-year-old ad tech sales manager in Atlanta, started out trading popular stocks on Robinhood and making deposits to his Roth individual retirement account. But after investing more than $15,000 a year on average by himself, Johnson in November decided that it was time to turn to a financial adviser.“You can save your money all you want,” he said, “but if it’s not doing anything, what does it look like long term?”The pandemic-fueled surge in the ranks of day traders could have been seen as a death knell for the financial planning and advice industry. But the field continues to grow, since even day traders and people who prefer set-and-forget index fund investments have come to realize that there’s a lot more components involved in building wealth.Johnson’s new adviser, chosen based on a friend’s recommendation, helped package his life insurance with a mix of whole- and term-based features, bolstered his savings habits and altered his retirement investments to improve their tax structure.According to a Cerulli Associates research study from October, 40% of U.S. investors surveyed said they need more advice. Those who said they were willing to pay a financial professional rose to 56%, up 5 percentage points from 2019. And 82% of those who are paying for financial advice said that it’s worth the price.In fact, stock investors who have a financial adviser were more than twice as likely to say that they are very confident that they have the best investment strategy compared with those going at it alone, according to a survey by Franklin Templeton and Gallup.After stocks plunged in March over Covid-19 fears, Los Angeles wealth management firm Aspiriant LLC saw greater demand for its services. And another set of new clients arrived later in the year as a wave of initial public offerings hit the market, according to Sandi Bragar, the company’s managing director for planning strategy and research. All told, she said by phone, the firm’s client list grew 32% in 2020.When Tia Ware, a 30-year-old pharmacist in Virginia, first considered hiring a financial adviser five years ago, she was taken aback by the $1,200 yearly fee.“At first I was like ‘hell no,’” Ware said in a FaceTime interview. “But now, yes, when I see my accounts. If I didn’t have a financial adviser, I’d only have shoes and bags to show for it.”In the early years, Ware just saw her adviser once or twice a year. But last year after the pandemic hit, she realized how imperative it was to engage more often.Eddie Welch, whose Montgomery, Alabama-based advisory firm was bought by Captrust Financial Advisors last year, said that any time there’s been financial upheaval, people “have been more warm and receptive to paying for and receiving advice.”Robinhood’s ImpactWelch, now a principal at Captrust, said that while apps like Robinhood make it easy to trade stocks, “it’s a little more difficult to get into the market with a plan. And in most cases I think that’s what people seek from us.”The growth of retail trading on free apps prompted major brokerage firms to also offer no-fee trades, with the hopes of convincing some of those customers to pay for advice. Many firms also added robo advisers -- software programs that use algorithms to mimic flesh-and-blood financial advisers.Charles Schwab Corp., which in October 2019 became the first of the majors to offer zero trading commissions, added 142,000 new accounts that month. This created “more of a pipeline for paid financial advice,” according to Morningstar analyst Michael Wong, who said that many of these clients would likely gravitate toward Schwab’s robo advice.In fact, Schwab’s digital advisory assets grew 18% year over year to $57.9 billion in 2020. This was part of the explosion in robo advisers, with users increasing to 71 million from 46 million in 2019, according to data compiled by LearnBonds.com.But most traders still want a personal touch. An Investopedia survey of young adults with household incomes of $50,000 or more found that 56% trusted a human financial adviser more than an automated one.Phyllis Klein, who leads Captrust’s education and advice programs, said clients’ desire for insights was growing sharply as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on society. “We’ve had almost 12,000 webinar attendees and that is threefold of what it was the prior year,” she said.“I can’t emphasize how much people need help,” Klein said, “and how much they just want to talk to somebody.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thanks-robinhood-traders-now-want-123000725.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-19	2021-01-19 14:02:00	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Charles Schwab stock jumps after profit and revenue beats, with trading households rising more than 50%	"Shares of Charles Schwab Corp. surged 2.1% in premarket trading Tuesday, after the discount brokerage reported fourth-quarter profit and revenue that beat Wall Street forecasts, as client engagement grew to record levels in 2020. Net income was $1.14 billion, or 57 cents a share, after net income of $852 million, or 62 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share rose to 74 cents from 63 cents and beat the FactSet consensus of 65 cents. Total revenue jumped 60% to $4.18 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $4.11 billion. ""The pandemic's rapid escalation in early 2020 was accompanied by volatile equity markets and further easing of monetary policy,"" said Chief Executive Walt Bettinger. ""As the year progressed, government aid packages and vaccine developments helped settle the markets, with the S&P 500 eventually erasing its pandemic-related losses to finish up 16% from December 2019."" That helped lift new-to-firm households last year by more than 175% from 2019, while the number of households placing trades rose more than 50%. The stock, which reached a record close of $61.20 on Jan. 12, has soared 51.1% over the past three months through Friday, while the S&P 500 has gained 10.0%."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8588d605-53b6-3213-96c8-a7aed217886e/charles-schwab-stock-jumps.html?.tsrc=rss

What Happened: Bloomberg reports that a man in California has sued the app-based trading platform in a proposed class-action suit. This is after Robinhood was hacked last year.Some 2,000 accounts were hacked. The plaintiff, Siddharth Mehta, says he lost tens of thousands of dollars from his account as a result of the attack. He claims Robinhood did not do enough to protect customer accounts and that the company did not inform him of the intrusion until months later, after it came out in media reports.""Robinhood's customers collectively lost millions of dollars,"" Bloomberg quotes Mehta as saying in the complaint.Why It Matters: Robinhood was among several key factors in the 2020 bull market that defied headlines that in most years would tank the market. The pioneer of no-commission trading ushered in a new generation of traders who leapt into the markets last year with gusto amid the downtime -- and governent stimulus money -- of the pandemic.Established trading platforms such as Fidelity, ETrade, Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) and TD Ameritrade followed its lead by offering no-commission trading. The company is likely to go public this year.

2021-01-06	2021-01-06 20:30:19	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	How to Double the Size of an Investment Firm in a Pandemic	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Doubling the size of an investment advisory firm is hard even without a pandemic. But Dave Welling, the chief executive officer of Mercer Advisors and this week’s guest on the Masters in Business podcast, did it. Welling explains how the firm, which has been around for 35 years, began to grow through acquisitions four years ago and kept it up last year.  The Denver-based registered investment advisor has 450 employees and manages more than $21 billion.Welling’s nontraditional career path, which included experience in consulting, private equity and technology, has given him a unique perspective on the financial services business. He explains the process the firm uses to identify, fund and negotiate acquisitions, with part of the secret being the focus on succession planning for small firm owners. Welling notes that deal structures have evolved due to plentiful private-equity capital in an era of very low interest rates. Private investors in RIAs get a steady cash flow, effectively creating a high yielding investment.We discuss his joining Charles Schwab Corp. in 1997 instead of Amazon.com Inc. Welling didn’t believe the Seattle start up represented the best career path for him, and he has never regretted the decision. We also discuss the lack of diversity in the financial services industry, which Welling describes as “male, pale and stale.” He explains a Mercer Advisor women’s initiative called InvestHERs, which is designed to promote diversity in the advisor industry.A list of his favorite books are here; A transcript of our conversation is available here.You can stream and download our full conversation, including the podcast extras on iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher, Google, Bloomberg, and Acast.

2020-12-29	2020-12-29 13:00:19	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Companies Are Fleeing California. Blame Bad Government.	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Amid raging wildfires, rolling blackouts and a worsening coronavirus outbreak, it has not been a great year for California. Unfortunately, the state is also reeling from a manmade disaster: an exodus of thriving companies to other states.In just the past few months, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. said it was leaving for Houston. Oracle Corp. said it would decamp for Austin. Palantir Technologies Inc., Charles Schwab Corp. and McKesson Corp. are all bound for greener pastures. No less an information-age avatar than Elon Musk has had enough. He thinks regulators have grown “complacent” and “entitled” about the state’s world-class tech companies.No doubt, he has a point. Silicon Valley’s high-tech cluster has been the envy of the world for decades, but there’s nothing inevitable about its success. As many cities have found in recent years, building such agglomerations is exceedingly hard, as much art as science. Low taxes, modest regulation, sound infrastructure and good education systems all help, but aren’t always sufficient. Once squandered, moreover, such dynamism can’t easily be revived. With competition rising across the U.S., the area’s policy makers need to recognize the dangers ahead.In recent years, San Francisco has seemed to be begging for companies to leave. In addition to familiar failures of governance — widespread homelessness, inadequate transit, soaring property crime — it has also imposed more idiosyncratic hindrances. Far from welcoming experimentation, it has sought to undermine or stamp out home-rental services, food-delivery apps, ride-hailing firms, electric-scooter companies, facial-recognition technology, delivery robots and more, even as the pioneers in each of those fields attempted to set up shop in the city. It tried to ban corporate cafeterias — a major tech-industry perk — on the not-so-sound theory that this would protect local restaurants. It created an “Office of Emerging Technology” that will only grant permission to test new products if they’re deemed, in a city bureaucrat’s view, to provide a “net common good.” Whatever the merits of such meddling, it’s hardly a formula for unbounded inventiveness.These two traits — poor governance and animosity toward business — have collided calamitously with respect to the city’s housing market. Even as officials offered tax breaks for tech companies to headquarter themselves downtown, they mostly refused to lift residential height limits, modify zoning rules or allow significant new construction to accommodate the influx of new workers. They then expressed shock that rents and home prices were soaring — and blamed the tech companies.California’s legislature has only made matters worse. A bill it enacted in 2019, ostensibly intended to protect gig workers, threatened to undo the business models of some of the state’s biggest tech companies until voters granted them a reprieve in a November referendum. A new privacy law has imposed immense compliance burdens — amounting to as much as 1.8% of state output in 2018 — while conferring almost no consumer benefits. An 8.8% state corporate tax rate and 13.3% top income-tax rate (the nation’s highest) haven’t helped.Of course, California isn’t alone in squandering such advantages. New York City has been the world’s top finance hub for many years, and increasingly had become home to a thriving tech community as well. But a similar blend of poor policy choices, high taxes, needless red tape, rising crime, and occasional outright hostility — as with the senseless opposition to Amazon.com Inc.’s proposed headquarters — has been pushing both industries to friendlier climes in recent years.Such carelessness is all the more damaging because a tech hub is more than the sum of its parts. Such clusters accelerate the flow of ideas, concentrate skilled workers and create productive new networks. They’re likely to boost investment, business formation, innovation, wages and growth. And their benefits are widely shared: By one estimate, each new tech job creates five additional jobs in other industries, a multiplier effect about three times larger than that for manufacturing. That’s not to mention the immensely popular products that result.For now, the Bay Area is unlikely to be displaced as the nation’s top tech hub. After all, it’s still home to some of the world’s most valuable companies, draws an outsized share of venture-capital investment, and remains an unrivaled incubator for startups. And predictions of Silicon Valley’s demise have proved reliably wrong for decades.Even so, no state can antagonize its companies so extravagantly and expect them to stay put forever. As every Californian knows, the open road is all too inviting.Editorials are written by the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.

2020-12-14	2020-12-14 12:00:22	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Silicon Valley VCs Contemplate a Pandemic Move, but Where?	(Bloomberg) -- This year, the partners at Founders Fund—a prominent San Francisco venture capital firm that has backed Airbnb Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and other leading companies—took an informal internal poll: If the fund could open a major new office outside the Bay Area, where would it go? It’s a question many venture capitalists and startups have considered this year in some form or another, spurred into action by the coronavirus pandemic that has so many people working from home anyway. Tech workers are leaving California in droves, sending San Francisco rents tumbling by as much as 35%. Large companies have made the leap, too. Oracle Corp. announced plans on Friday to leave the Bay Area for Austin, Texas, e-cigarette maker Juul said it would move to Washington, D.C., and cybersecurity firm Tanium is moving to a suburb of Seattle. Even Elon Musk has said he’s now a Texan. But the venture capital industry could prove particularly difficult to dislodge from Silicon Valley. Data from PitchBook shows that year after year, the Bay Area accounts for easily the largest proportion of venture investments in the U.S.—around one-fifth of all deals. Measured by funding amount, the Bay’s dominance looks even more formidable. Last year, 38% of all venture dollars deployed went to startups in Silicon Valley. So far this year, despite the pandemic, that number ticked up to 40%. And according to startup accelerator Y Combinator, the percentage of founders listing their addresses as within the Bay Area has held steady this year.The numbers underscore the fundamental conundrum: Although many places around the U.S. are attracting more startups, no clear rival is emerging to Silicon Valley. So where can a venture firm go that would provide a decent alternative?  “If it were obvious, you would have seen more of an exodus to a single place,” said Lauren Gross, Founders Fund partner and chief operating officer.Founders Fund, the firm that conducted the internal poll, is currently housed in a low-slung brick complex in San Francisco fronted by Yoda from Star Wars and known for housing George Lucas’s film production company. This year, the firm spent months considering locations for a major new office. The question of where else Founders Fund could build a presence had come up before—its backer, Peter Thiel, left San Francisco years ago—but the idea took on new urgency during the pandemic.Partners passed around a spreadsheet where they could nominate and vote on cities, according to people familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. In weekly Zoom meetings, dozens of names came up. The firm seriously considered about a half-dozen cities, among them Los Angeles, Miami and Denver, which is now home to portfolio company Palantir.The Founders Fund team also listed all the cities outside the Bay Area where it had invested in startups or had close ties to founders. It factored in tax rates, local regulations and proximity to a major hub airport, the people said. New Orleans, the pick of Michael Solana, a Founders Fund vice president, got eliminated due to what some considered a subpar flight schedule. Ditto Nashville.In the end, no city could foster enough momentum among the Founders Fund staff. The firm will mostly stay put, and has scrapped plans to pursue a major new office for the time being. Instead, it will open a smaller office in Miami. But even though the firm isn’t going anywhere, several individual partners at Founder Fund have moved out of town. In addition to Thiel, a vocal San Francisco critic who has lived in Los Angeles for years, partner Keith Rabois recently said he would move to Miami. And partner Scott Nolan splits his time between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The news of more tech industry departures comes as the Bay Area grapples with unpleasant realities. Many VCs complain that given its large city budget, $13.6 billion for the 2020 to 2021 fiscal year, San Francisco seems unable to effectively solve problems such as homelessness. The region also faces high rents and intense competition for hiring, along with what some regard as overreaching state regulation. One example: a measure signed into law in September aimed at increasing minority representation on boards. Opponents objected to what they saw as political meddling in business. Venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale, another investor in Thiel’s circle, said earlier this year he was moving his firm, 8VC, to Austin from San Francisco. Lonsdale cited San Francisco’s checkered record on public safety, the area’s strained electricity grid and municipal government dysfunction among the reasons for his move. In an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal titled “California, Love It and Leave It,” he also criticized the state’s “intolerant far left.” In a similar conversation with Fortune, Rabois called San Francisco “massively improperly run.” And he brought up another factor that often goes unmentioned in such articles: California’s high state income tax. Many investors fleeing Silicon Valley are moving to states that don’t tax personal income, including Florida, Texas and Washington. Taxes may provide some VCs with a new, urgent reason to leave California, particularly if they’re due for big potential gains from a record year of initial public offerings, including the stock market listings of Airbnb and DoorDash Inc. California has the highest top marginal income tax rate for individuals in the country, at 13.3%, which some lawmakers tried unsuccessfully to raise still higher this year. Counterintuitively, some of the Bay Area’s biggest businesses may be more likely to relocate than their nimbler startup counterparts. Charles Schwab Corp. and McKesson Corp. have left San Francisco for Texas, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. said this month that it would also make the move. Large players typically already run substantial offices in other cities, and have more to gain from lower tax rates and less regulation. “It’ll not be difficult for these companies to move,” said Michael Marks, a founding managing partner at venture firm WRVI Capital and former chief executive officer of construction startup Katerra Inc.Startups, however, may have more trouble uprooting. Marks said several of his portfolio companies considered moving and then rejected the idea as too challenging. That’s largely because they tend to be small, and have the entirety of their operations based in the Bay Area. Many VCs are likely to follow their startups’ lead. The rise of work-from-home culture and Zoom pitch decks has made it easier for individual investors to do their jobs from exotic locales, but the heavily networked nature of the industry could wind up keeping most venture offices bound to the Bay Area. “VC is not a contactless sport,” said Brandy Aven, a professor of entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon University’s business school. “The growth in venture investments in other regions has been due to spillover, and there is little reason to think that these other regions will supplant Silicon Valley.”Despite the rolling power outages, snarling traffic and persistently high housing costs, for most VCs, living in California’s Marin County still looks a lot easier than flying in from Nashville. For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silicon-valley-vcs-contemplate-pandemic-120022931.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-02	2020-12-02 02:00:27	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Hewlett Packard Enterprise to Leave Silicon Valley for Texas	(Bloomberg) -- Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. will move its headquarters to Houston, a major shift for a founding Silicon Valley computer maker now seeking haven in a lower-cost region while making way for a new generation of nimbler mobile and consumer-web giants.The company said it was already building a “state-of-the-art” new campus in Houston, the fourth-largest U.S. city. HPE also reported quarterly revenue that topped analysts’ predictions, suggesting that businesses are upgrading their data-center hardware during the coronavirus pandemic.HPE was created in the 2015 split of one of the consummate Bay Area technology companies, Hewlett-Packard Co., which was founded in 1939 in a Palo Alto garage. The move to Texas comes amid a broader re-evaluation, motivated by pandemic-enforced work-from-anywhere arrangements, by individuals and companies opting to leave behind a region known for its high cost of living and difficult commute.Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri has been working to turn around HPE, a maker of servers, storage hardware and networking gear, which had reported declining revenue in all but one quarter since separating from personal-computer maker HP Inc. Neri is reducing the company’s overhead costs, exiting unprofitable businesses and chasing the hybrid-cloud market, in which businesses store and process some of their information in corporate data centers and some with public cloud companies.Sales in the quarter ended Oct. 31 were little changed from a year ago at $7.2 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated $6.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, was 37 cents a share in the fiscal fourth quarter, HPE said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts had projected 34 cents.The spread of Covid-19 and the economic slowdown it triggered had suppressed demand for networking and computer hardware and services. Now that companies have settled into remote work for many employees, they’re investing in gear to make that more efficient.“The global pandemic has forced businesses to rethink everything from remote work and collaboration to business continuity and data insight,” Neri said in the statement. “We saw a notable rebound in our overall revenue, with particular acceleration in key growth areas of our business.”Hewlett Packard Enterprises follows a handful of other companies exiting at least in part from the San Francisco Bay Area. Newly public data-mining provider Palantir Technologies Inc. moved to Denver from Palo Alto earlier this year, while besieged e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. is relocating to Washington from San Francisco. Charles Schwab Corp. said last year its headquarters will shift from San Francisco to Westlake, Texas. Many individuals, encouraged by laissez-faire work-from-home rules and put off by the cost of living in California, are also on the move.As Hewlett Packard Enterprises and its predecessor company receded from prominence in recent years, newer companies -- such as Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. -- have taken their place in the Silicon Valley pantheon.Fiscal fourth-quarter sales increased 6% from the prior period. In the current quarter, HPE projected that profit, excluding some items, will be 40 cents to 44 cents. That compares with an average analyst prediction of 35 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company said sales will decline from the preceding period at a percentage in the mid-single digits, in line with normal seasonal patterns. A decline of 5% would indicate sales of about $6.84 billion. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $6.63 billion.The company will keep its technology innovation hub in San Jose, at a relatively new building, CEO Neri said on a conference call with analysts. Administrative work will be centered at the new Texas headquarters. Consolidating more expensive facilities in California will lead to real estate cost savings, he said.No staff reductions are associated with the move, HPE said in the statement. The company has locations in several cities in Texas, including Austin and Plano, and has more than 2,600 workers in Houston, according to a statement from the office of Governor Greg Abbott.HPE shares were little changed in extended trading after closing at $11.20 in New York. They have declined 29% this year.(Adds other companies leaving the Bay Area starting in eighth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hewlett-packard-enterprise-leave-silicon-020027107.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-28	2020-11-28 12:00:00	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Tesla FOMO Fires Up Wall Street’s $300 Billion Custom-Index Boom	(Bloomberg) -- When the world’s most-famous electric car maker finally joins the S&P 500, it will be bittersweet for investors with about $11 trillion in funds tied to the gauge. Their benchmark-hugging bets get some Elon Musk magic at last, but they pay seven times last year’s price for the privilege.Given the chance, how many would have added Tesla Inc. to their index exposure in January? Or even June, when the shares had merely doubled?Customization is at the heart of a red-hot investing strategy driving two of the biggest deals in asset management this year. Known as direct indexing, it blurs the line between stock-picking and benchmark-following and now commands about $300 billion after its popularity surged in recent years.The idea is simple: Instead of buying shares in a fund that slavishly holds all the companies in an index, investors buy those stocks directly. The index exposure is broadly the same, but the investors are no longer wedded to it. They can make tweaks -- like adding a skyrocketing automaker well ahead of the S&P 500, for example.“The Tesla issue of the last few months is probably highlighting for the first time to a lot of people that the S&P is not the largest 500 companies,” said Elya Schwartzman, founder of ES Investment Consulting LLC. With direct indexing, “you can just create your own index and say, look I want the largest 600 companies by U.S. market capitalization,” he added.Direct indexing is a modern twist on separately managed accounts, which have been around for years and are used to build bespoke portfolios for wealthy individuals. The age of zero-commission trading and growing use of fractional shares means similar strategies can now be deployed for smaller investors.It remains a nascent part of the asset-management industry, but the buzz is building. Morgan Stanley’s $7 billion purchase of Eaton Vance Corp. is all about direct indexing -- the latter’s Parametric Portfolio Associates is the largest provider in the field. BlackRock Inc. this week announced a $1 billion takeover of Aperio, a creator of tailored index strategies.The ESG EffectAs dramatic as the Tesla example is, the real selling point for direct indexing may turn out to be the ability to remove companies from a portfolio’s exposure rather than add them.In the drive toward investments that meet environmental, social and governance criteria -- which also happens to be one of the tailwinds for Tesla -- huge disagreements exist over exactly what qualifies. Direct indexing allows an investor to make adjustments according to his or her own views, and remove companies not up to scratch.Read more: Record Flows Pour Into ESG Funds as Their ‘Wokeness’ Is Debated“Having this additional need for customization is really where we get involved,” said Jeff Brown, director of institutional portfolio management for Parametric. “If I want market exposure, there are quick easy ways to get it through an ETF, but if I want to customize in any way, shape or form that doesn’t exist in the ETF space, that’s where we can step in to fill that gap.”That kind of flexibility comes with a price, however. While fierce competition among brokers and asset managers has driven down trading costs across the industry -- boosting direct-indexing products in the process -- they still typically charge about 0.15%-0.35%.That’s less than an active mutual fund, but three to five times the price of some equity exchange-traded funds. The fee for the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) is just 0.03%, for example.“If direct indexing is going to experience another leg of growth, it’s going have to fan out further to the mass affluent market,” said Ben Johnson, Morningstar’s global director of ETF research. “It’s going to have to be achievable at a lower entry point.”Until recently, direct indexing tended to be the preserve of high net-worth individuals, according to Tom O’Shea, director of managed accounts at Cerulli Associates.The investing approach offers a huge tax benefit because investors have more losses which they can use to offset gains. ETFs famously do this as well, but direct indexing lets an investor utilize it at an individual stock level, which is estimated to add between 1 and 2 percentage points a year to returns.Making the most of that traditionally required a large number of securities owned outright, putting it out of reach of the average investor. But improving technology and fractional shares offered by brokerages like Charles Schwab Corp. and Robinhood are changing things.“You’re able to do the same thing with a smaller portfolio,” said O’Shea. “You can have 200 securities, but you don’t have to have as much money.”Deal MakerA recent study from Cerulli found that 67% of asset-management firms believe direct indexing presents the most-immediate opportunity to manage for both tax and ESG factors, so it’s no surprise to see big names making moves in the industry.The world’s largest asset-manager, BlackRock, said in its third-quarter earnings call that it plans to invest heavily in its separately managed account business. The Aperio purchase will bring its assets in that area to more than $160 billion, the company said.Alongside that and Morgan Stanley’s deal for Eaton Vance, Charles Schwab acquired a firm called Motif this year that offers direct indexing. Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger II has said the strategy will play an important role in the future of the company.Yet there remains plenty of skepticism that growth can meaningfully accelerate.Even customizing to include the surging Tesla ahead of the S&P 500 can’t beat the pure cost-efficiency of an ETF, according to Morgan Barna, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.VTI, which includes Tesla, has only delivered fractionally better performance this year than State Street’s SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. Meanwhile, for all the hype, the ESG investing phenomenon remains in its infancy.That could be one reason why industry leader Parametric’s direct-indexing inflows total only $15 billion for the past year, while inflows to the ETF business at BlackRock -- the largest issuer in the space -- total $126 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The incremental return would have to be much higher from the sum total of your custom choices to make it worth it,” said Barna. “People who felt really strongly either bought Tesla directly outside their index exposure” or bought a broader ETF, where the carmaker was included, she said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-fomo-fires-wall-street-120000245.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-11	2020-11-11 15:57:21	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	5 Brokerage Execs On 2020 Market Trends: 'Trading Has Become Cool Again'	"Lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic have prompted a rise in speculative retail trading activity that's reflected in increased client order flow.The trend was the topic of discussion among five market experts Tuesday at the Benzinga Global Fintech Awards in a panel moderated by Benzinga's Luke Jacobi. The Options Clearing Corporation traded a record number of options in a day following positive efficacy news about the COVID-19 vaccine candidate being co-developed by Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX), said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.James Putra, head of product strategy at TradeStation, said the volatility in different assets has been the primary engagement factor since lockdowns were lifted.""Trading has become cool again,"" he said. The Importance Of Education For Retail Traders: Enhanced, mobile-friendly education is important as lockdowns disappear, as it exposes traders to increasingly complex concepts that can fit evolving trading personalities, said Mary Ryan, senior director at E*Trade. When life returns to normal, it's important for brokerages to remain here for investors through ""enhanced options education,"" she said. Kinahan said that, unlike in the past, retail investors are taking the time to learn complex products and strategies properly. TD Ameritrade is spending more resources on education to assist traders with their goals of becoming profitable, he said. ""We've done a pretty good job of marrying the theory with the trade ideas.""Innovation At M1 Finance, Schwab: The automated money management platform M1 Finance focuses on a holistic financial experience, said CEO Brian Barnes. ""M1 tries to help a user manage all their finances,"" he said, highlighting M1's functionality as a tool for investing, borrowing and banking.""M1 is oriented more toward long-term, systemic investing rather than trading.""Jeff Chiappetta, the vice president of trading services at Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW), said Schwab is working to maintain long-term engagement through product innovation.As an example, ""Schwab launched stock slices, which allows clients to buy S&P 500 stocks with as little as $5,"" he said.""They're hungry for new content [and] we've launched new segments, combining that live education with stable content.""TradeStation's Putra noted his firm's addition of new asset classes, allowing investors to gain increased exposure to differentiated risks.""Having exposure to crypto assets is great,"" Putra said.""We have high-yield interest on crypto holdings,"" which he said allows participants a way to make money on the sidelines when opportunity is minimal.""We believe this puts the customer on an accelerated path.""

2020-10-27	2020-10-27 05:27:55	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Charles Schwab To Ax 3% Of Workforce To Rid of 'Redundant' Roles Post TD Ameritrade Merger	"Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) announced 3% job cuts, or roughly 1,000 layoffs, from Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade's combined workforce on Monday. Schwab claimed it would extend support for the affected employees with reemployment assistance and severance benefits.What Happened: The current round of layoffs will attempt to eliminate ""redundant"" and ""overlapping"" roles and the company disclosed that, despite the uncertainty, it would not make any further headcount reductions this year.  The financial services company will continue to hire across critical functions that support its client base. All employees facing the ax would be granted early access to these internal job postings.Why Does It Matter: Schwab acquired TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation in 2019 for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction. The financial services company said the purchase helped its portfolio grow by 12 million in new client accounts with $1.3 trillion in client assets and an annual revenue boost of $5 billion.According to CNBC, the newly created entity from the Charles Schwab-TD Ameritrade merger deal has a portfolio of 28 million accounts with approximately $6 trillion worth of client assets under management.Although the merger was closed this month, it could take another 18 months to 36 months to streamline the organizational structure, Charles Schwab said.Price Movement: SCHW shares dropped 2.97% on Monday to close at $39.15.Photo courtesy: WikimediaSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Bayer Acquires AskBio For B To Strengthen Its Gene Therapy Platform  * Samsung Shares Surge As Jay Y Lee Set To Take Charge After Father's Death(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The cuts are part of an effort to reduce “overlapping or redundant roles.”The $26 billion deal, announced last November, was completed earlier this month. The combined firm will “continue to hire in strategic areas critical to our growing client base,” according to the statement, with affected employees getting early access to open positions.The acquisition gives Schwab, America’s original discount broker, even more sway over the industry it pioneered nearly a half-century ago. The combined firm has some $6 trillion in client assets across 28 million brokerage accounts.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-cut-1-000-001608405.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-15	2020-10-15 18:58:22	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Robinhood Internal Probe Finds Hackers Hit Almost 2,000 Accounts	(Bloomberg) -- Almost 2,000 Robinhood Markets accounts were compromised in a recent hacking spree that siphoned off customer funds, a sign that the attacks were more widespread than was previously known.A person with knowledge of an internal review, who asked not to be identified because the findings aren’t public, provided the estimated figure.When Bloomberg first reported on the hacking spree last week, the popular online brokerage disclosed few details. It said “a limited number” of customers had been struck by cyber-criminals who gained access by breaching personal email accounts outside of Robinhood, an assertion that some of the victims acknowledge and others reject.Read more: Robinhood Users Say Accounts Were Looted, No One to CallThe attacks unleashed a torrent of complaints on social media, where investors recounted futile attempts to call the brokerage, which doesn’t have a customer service phone number. Robinhood, which has more than 13 million customer accounts, is now considering whether to add a phone number along with other tools, the person said.“We always respond to customers reporting fraudulent or suspicious activity and work as quickly as possible to complete investigations,” the company said in an emailed statement. “The security of Robinhood customer accounts is a top priority and something we take very seriously.”This week, Robinhood sent push notifications to users suggesting they enable two-factor authentication on their accounts. It also plans to send customers more advice on security, according to the statement.Also read: Digital Thieves Are Hacking Brokerage Accounts: Is Your Money Safe?Several victims said they found no sign of criminals compromising their email accounts. And some said their brokerage accounts were accessed even though they had set up two-factor authentication.Lena Williams, a human resources professional in the Chicago area, can’t figure out how hackers got into her account more than a month ago. She found no intrusion into her email and had set up two-factor authentication. But one day, she woke up to alerts that her investments were being sold, and she quickly discovered she was locked out of the account.Robinhood has said it will work quickly with customers to secure their holdings. Williams said her account was hit Sept. 10 and that her repeated emails and a Twitter message weren’t returned until Thursday.Miah Brittany Laino, who works at a home-improvement store in Arizona, thought her account was safe for several reasons. She said two-factor authentication initially blocked someone from accessing it on Sept. 13. She then followed Robinhood’s instructions to change her password. The firm said it would prevent trading until she submitted her identification. She didn’t bother to send it in, figuring it would be safer to leave the account disabled.Early the next morning she received a barrage of alerts on her phone. “It said ‘This stock sold. This stock sold. This stock sold,’” recalled Laino, 29. “It’s like if you wake up at 4 a.m. and your house is on fire.”Fake IDUnable to find a phone number, Laino said she emailed customer support but received no response. Then she checked her email’s trash bin and discovered someone had accessed it, setting it up to intercept messages from Robinhood. Laino said she got a call from customer support on Sept. 25. That’s when she learned someone had created fake identification and submitted it to Robinhood to reactivate trading. The forgery had her information, a photo of a different person and a font that doesn’t match Arizona’s official state IDs.Laino said Robinhood restored her account and stock holdings, but she still plans to eventually leave the firm.“I don’t want to sell right now,” she said. “But I’m not going to put any more money into it. I don’t really trust them.”Robert Riachi, 23, is still in limbo.He said his email was compromised more than a week ago and that thousands of dollars went missing from his Robinhood account. Its customer support team asked him to provide ID, but Riachi said that since submitting it he hasn’t received updates. Each time he asked for one, he got a new case number and now has about 10 of them, he said, noting three are active.Riachi, a software engineer in Montreal, said he had four years of savings in his account and doesn’t know whether they’re gone because he’s locked out. If he gets the money back, he plans to move his account to Charles Schwab Corp.“I feel like my money could be put somewhere else, somewhere that has a human person that I can talk to,” Riachi said. “It’s kind of ridiculous that an investment app that’s handling people’s livelihoods, people’s money, has the audacity to make people wait several weeks to hear back anything.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-estimates-hackers-infiltrated-almost-185822576.html?.tsrc=rss

Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session.The stock is currently higher from its 52 week low by 35.82%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Capital Markets stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.View more earnings on SCHWMost often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.Charles Schwab Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 33.99 of the Capital Markets industry.

Fresh out of college, we were now among the top earners in our peer group. Twenty-hours-plus daily, most days of the week, working hard on pitchbooks, models and deals. We saw eye-to-eye on most things: people, what we were going to eat that night off of seamlessweb.com, and, more or less, life.We were both so-called Millennials, defined as those born between 1981 and 1996. There were a couple of big differences. One was that she thought about savings and investing her earnings. I was more basic, just thinking about spending less than I made. The day Jackie had to run out to set up her Charles Schwab Corp. account, I barely understood what she was doing. She came back with flyers and talked about Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, bond funds.I was bemused. While I could go through companies’ financial statements and run accretion-dilution and discounted cash flow models, I could just about keep track of my personal income. I was basically financially illiterate when it came to my own accounts. That stemmed, as I now see it, from the more fundamental difference between us: We grew up on two sides of the world — she in Maryland, me in Indore, India.Our micro-example is reflected in several surveys showing that financial literacy rates in Asia are far lower than in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.(1)That means possessing a basic understanding of concepts like interest rates, compounding, diversifying risk, and inflation to make decisions about personal savings. Money management behavior is tightly linked to such knowledge.Some of this comes down to cultural investing priorities. In Asia, property and gold – hard assets – have always taken precedence over speculative stocks and bonds. Capital markets haven’t been deep enough for previous generations to participate with confidence. Nor were retail investing products mainstream. A recent survey by China’s central bank that covered more than 30,000 urban households in 30 provinces showed that almost 60% of assets were tied up in real estate. About 70% of liabilities were mortgages. The portion of financial assets was low.To be sure, the privileges of investing and even holding financial assets are often impossible for many people in wealthy countries who are just trying to make ends meet. That’s even more true in emerging economies.In India, the average household has 77% of total assets in real estate and 11% in gold, according to a Reserve Bank of India report. The total is 44% in the U.S. About 5% is held in financial assets like savings accounts, mutual funds and publicly traded shares, compared to 17% in the U.S., a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. report says.Generational attitudes get passed along. My parents didn’t really talk about money at the table or otherwise; it was only ever mentioned in terms of being prudent. (That’s a whole different topic I’ll save for another column.) Jackie’s family had a slightly different approach. Her allowance (and that of her younger brother) was split into four jars: taxes, savings, charity and spending money. They got to choose the charity. That helped create a sense of where money goes. “My dad was always (like) dollars and cents, spend wisely and make good choices,” she told me recently. “But not miserly.”For Millennials, choices are constantly changing. In the U.S., gurus like @MrsDowJones drop knowledge on their hundreds of thousands of Instagram and Twitter followers. Millennial investing podcasts laud putting money where you spend your time, thinking about your own price per hour when setting out for a new purchase. Gaming is big; experiences are more valuable than things. Millennials tend to think more about wellness and what’s good for the environment (greener packaging, no plastics). Fashion choices are sustainable — vegan leather, you name it. In Asia, the tech-enabled generation is beginning to take charge of its finances. Millennials have increasingly become a bigger part of the Asian consumer class that has driven travel and spending across the world. In India, savings in physical and financial assets as a portion of gross domestic product has been dropping, while net financial savings as a share of the gross national disposable income has also come down.To this cohort, property and jewelry increasingly look old-school. The permanence of such holdings is a turn-off. These assets are plagued with issues parents faced buying property (especially in India — a pre-sale gone bad, an incomplete project that took their cash) and the shifting relative value of gold. There are also questions of taste and practicality. Will I pull out bling and unfashionable traditional jewelry to go to the office? Unlikely. Online finance makes growing sense. More people in China are buying wealth management products, or thinking about how to maximize their balance sheets and taking out consumer loans. In India, investing apps such as Groww are all the rage. Backed by the likes of Sequoia India, it has 8 million users for mutual fund offerings and a couple of hundred thousand have bought stocks on it. Zerodha, ETMoney and others are increasingly popular.Economic insecurity from Covid-19 will likely accelerate the change. Millennials will be less quick to splash out on soy lattes and yoga pants, especially in Asia, as they become savers again. What they buy will be higher up the quality ladder – “premiumization.” That behavior will come with smarter ways to put their money to work instead of stashing it away in vanilla bank deposits. Risk profiles should change.There might be a whole new class of savvier savers, but the need for financial literacy will remain paramount. A YouGov-Mint Millennial Survey in India recently found that post-Millennials, born after 1996, “are much more likely to keep their savings as cash and least likely to invest in mutual funds.” But, this crowd was more prone to invest in cryptocurrencies and alternative investments. I’m still behind the curve on investing my retirement savings, but I’m going to start by setting up four jars for my kids today. (1) But even in the U.S., financial literacy levels amongMillennials are considered low when compared to older generations. https://gflec.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Millennials-and-Money-Technical-Report-August2020.pdf?x38887This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

2020-09-23	2020-09-23 14:03:28	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Analyzing Charles Schwab's Unusual Options Activity	On Wednesday, shares of Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $35.75.  * Sentiment: NEUTRAL  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-16  * Strike Price: $37.00  * Volume: 802  * Open Interest: 2364Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'Exceptionally large volume is one way options activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.When a contract has an expiration date in the distant future, it is generally another sign of unusual activity. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.&quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. &quot;Out of the money&quot; occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: WAVE Life Sciences  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: Churchill Capital  * Analyzing Ford Motor's Unusual Options Activity(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-20	2020-09-20 12:00:09	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	California Burnin’ — a Warning Against One-Party Rule	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- “California, folks, is America fast forward.” Thus Governor Gavin Newsom, hoarsely, amid brown smoke at the North Complex Fire on Sept. 11. “What we’re experiencing right here is coming to a community all across the United States of America … unless we get our act together on climate change.”I was with him all the way until he said the words “on climate change.”As my Hoover Institution colleague Victor Davis Hanson put it last month, California is “the progressive model of the future: a once-innovative, rich state that is now a civilization in near ruins. The nation should watch us this election year and learn of its possible future.”Let’s start with the fires. So far this year, they have torched more than five times as much land as the average of the previous 33 years, killing 25 people and forcing about 100,000 people from their homes. At one point, three of the largest fires in the state’s history were burning simultaneously in a ring around the San Francisco Bay Area. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CAL FIRE, of the 10 largest fires since 1970, five broke out this year. Nine out of 10 have occurred since 2012.No doubt high temperatures and unusual thunderstorms bear some of the responsibility for this year’s terrifying wildfires on the West Coast. It is deeply misleading to claim, as some diehard deniers still do, that temperatures aren’t rising and making wildfires more likely. But it is equally misleading to claim, as the New York Times did last week, that “scientists say” climate change “is the primary cause of the conflagration.”In reality, as Stanford’s Rebecca Miller, Christopher Field and Katharine J. Mach argue in a recent article in Nature Sustainability, this crisis has at least as much to do with disastrous land mismanagement as with climate change, and perhaps more. Anyone who thinks solar panels, Teslas and a $3.3 billion white elephant of a high-speed rail line will avoid comparable or worse fires next year (and the year after and the year after) doesn’t understand what the scientists are really saying.Most measures proposed by environmentalists to reduce carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gas” emissions will pay off over 50 to 100 years, as the International Panel on Climate Change has long made clear. Even a best-case scenario of “stringent mitigation” (what the IPCC calls Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6) would not bring carbon dioxide emissions down to 1950 levels until around 2050. Nor would it lower global average temperatures; it would merely stop them rising.And that’s only if the whole world — including China and India — takes action. California’s wildfire problem cannot be solved by the state’s citizens “getting their act together on climate change,” in Newsom’s words. The problem needs immediately effective action — and that means a return to sane forest management, if such a return is still possible. For decades, Democratic leaders in California have presided over a policy of leaving dead trees to rot, instead of the old and rational system of prescribed or controlled burns, not least because environmental and clear air regulations, as well as problems of legal liability, made controlled burns harder and harder to do.In prehistoric California, according to a recent analysis in ProPublica, between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each year. California’s land managers burned about 30,000 acres a year on average between 1982 and 1998. Over the next 18 years, that number dropped to an annual 13,000 acres. The result has been a huge accumulation of highly flammable kindling.  Miller, Field and Mach concluded that a total area of around 20 million acres — roughly one-fifth of the state’s territory — was in urgent need of “fuel treatment,” meaning prescribed burns, mechanical thinning and managed wildfire. It is hard to imagine anything remotely close to that happening under the current political dispensation. (The authors politely called for “fundamental shifts in prescribed-burn policies, beyond those currently under consideration.”) Or rather, it is going to happen, but at a time of Nature’s choosing, with catastrophic consequences.A case in point: For a year and a half, red tape slowed down a forest-thinning project in Berry Creek, Butte County. The project covered just 54 acres but, thanks to the burdensome provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, work had yet to start when the North Complex wildfire struck, devastating the town and killing 10 people.I have some skin in this game. Four years ago, I moved from Harvard University to Stanford University. My family traded a solid, century-old professorial residence in Cambridge for a wooden house in a wooded area that to our wooden heads seemed most idyllic. A few weeks ago, our neighborhood was on the edge of the evacuation zone.However, I have less skin in the game than Victor Davis Hanson. He lives on the fruit and nut farm near Selma, in the Central Valley, that his family has owned since the 1870s. The air quality index in Stanford rose above 170 on three days in the last month. In Selma last week it was 460. (Anything above 301 qualifies as “emergency conditions.”)I write these words over 1,000 miles from our California home, but it’s no good: in recent days the smoke has found us, too. Hotel parking lots full of vehicles with CA license plates confirm that we are not the only eastward migrants. It’s like Steinbeck’s “Grapes of Wrath” in reverse: Now that the Golden State is the Char-Grilled State, Californians have become the new Okies, though a good deal less impecunious.Yet wildfires are only one of the reasons people are fleeing California. In addition, the wrongheaded environmental policies of the sages of Sacramento have so undermined the power grid (for example, by shutting down gas-fired power plants and refusing to count hydroelectric energy as renewable) that residents have been subjected to rolling blackouts this year. The same policies have largely killed off the oil and gas industry. Newsom & Co. have failed to upgrade the water system to keep pace with the last half-century of population growth.It’s not that California politicians don’t know how to spend money. Back in 2007, total state spending was $146 billion. Last year it was $215 billion. I know, I know: In real terms California’s GDP increased by nearly a third in the same period. And I know: If it were an independent nation it would be the fifth-largest economy in the world, ahead of India’s. But for how much longer will that be true?California’s taxes aren’t the highest in the country — for the median household. But the tax system is one of the most progressive, with a 13.3% top tax rate on incomes above $1 million — and that’s no longer deductible from the federal tax bill as it used to be. The top 1% of taxpayers (those earning more than $500,000) now account for half of personal income-tax revenue. And there’s worse to come.The latest brilliant ideas in Sacramento are to raise the top income rate up to 16.8% and to levy a wealth tax (0.4% on personal fortunes over $30 million) that you couldn’t even avoid paying if you left the state. (The proposal envisages payment for up to 10 years after departure to a lower-tax state.) It is a strange place that seeks to repel the rich while making itself a magnet for illegal immigrants by establishing no fewer than 20 “sanctuary” cities or counties.And the results of all this progressive policy? A poverty boom. California now has 12% of the nation's population, but over 30% of its welfare recipients. By the official measure, based mainly on income and family size, California’s 11.4% poverty rate in 2019 was close to the national average over the past three years. However, according to a new Census Bureau report, which takes housing and other costs into account, the real poverty rate in California is 17.2%, the highest of any state. (Newsom gets one thing right when he says, “We're living in the wealthiest as well as the poorest state in America.”)About a third of California’s poverty can be attributed to housing and other living costs such as clothing and utilities. As everyone who resides there knows, there’s a chronic housing shortage in the Bay Area (the median-priced home in San Francisco costs about $1.5 million), mainly because a plethora of regulations make the construction of affordable housing well-nigh impossible. In blithe disregard of all we know about rent controls — which discourage landlords from providing housing — that is, predictably, the solution the Democrats propose.But that’s not all. The state’s public schools rank 37th in the country overall and have the highest pupil-teacher ratio. “Only half of California students meet English standards and fewer meet math standards, test scores show,” was a headline in the Los Angeles Times last October. Health care and pension costs are unsustainable. Oh, and they messed up on Covid-19, despite imposing the nation’s first shelter-in-place orders. Having prematurely claimed victory, California now leads New York in terms of cases, though not deaths.Back in the 1960s, California was the world’s fantasy destination. “California Dreamin’,” “California Girls,” “Going to California” — you know the songs. But reputations have a way of outliving reality. Despite the economic miracle wrought in Silicon Valley, beginning with the genesis of the internet back in the 1970s, and despite the continuing strength of the state’s universities, the dream in terms of quality of life has slowly died.When I first visited San Francisco in 1981, it was still one of the loveliest cities I had ever beheld. Now its streets are so filthy — human feces and syringe needles are the principal hazards — that I avoid it. (I was going to say “like the plague,” but that’s Lake Tahoe.)Yet the Bay Area and its southern sister Los Angeles are only one of the two Californias. As Hanson argued 10 years ago, the Central Valley is another country, more “Caribbean” or Latin American, where “countless inland communities … have become near-apartheid societies, where Spanish is the first language, the schools are not at all diverse, and the federal and state governments are either the main employers or at least the chief sources of income.”The principal reason for California’s decline is that the Golden State became a one-party state. The Republican candidate won California in every election but one (1964) between 1952 and 1988. But the Democrat has won California in every election since, with the Democratic vote share rising from 46% in 1992 to 62% in 2016.Democrats now have 61 out of 80 seats in the California State Assembly. The last time Republicans had a majority (of one) was in 1994, but that was an anomaly. The Democrats have essentially controlled the State Senate since 1958, with rising majorities since the 1990s. Apart from 1994, the only other year since 1958 when they did not win a majority of seats in the Assembly was 1968.When regular voting has no effect, people eventually vote with their feet. From 2007 until 2016, about five million people moved to California but six million moved out to other states. For years before that, the newcomers were poorer than the leavers. This net exodus is surging in 2020. And businesses (for example, Charles Schwab Corp.) are leaving too. Silicon Valley is going virtual, with many big tech companies thinking of making work from home permanent for at least some employees. (One tech chief executive told me last week that his engineers were pleading not to return to the office.)People are getting out of the Bay Area as much and perhaps more than they are getting out of New York City. Texas is only one of the favored alternatives. Realtors in Montana are reporting record demand from West Coast refugees. The hotels are full, which is unheard of at this time of year. I also know a number of eminent Californians who are now Hawaiians.The conservative writer and broadcaster Ben Shapiro, born in L.A., just announced that he is heading to Nashville, Tennessee. “I love the state, grew up in the state, married in the state and have had children in the state,” he told Laura Ingraham. But California was “not a great place to raise children and not a great place to build a company.” Now we know the true meaning of Calexit. It’s not secession. It’s exodus.I cannot blame the leavers. When I moved West in 2016, it was in the naive belief that California was Massachusetts without snow and Stanford was Harvard with September weather all year round. How wrong I was.But am I leaving? Well, maybe there’s no point. As Newsom’s predecessor Jerry Brown put it last week: “There are going to be problems everywhere in the United States. This is the new normal. It’s been predicted and it’s happening … Tell me: Where are you going to go? What’s your alternative?” Great question, but — as with Newsom’s prophecy — wrongly framed. The big problem is not that climate change is coming to every state. It is, though most states will mitigate it better than California. The problem is that Democratic governance could be coming to the nation as a whole, starting on Jan. 20. And with the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, turning 78 two weeks after election day, it is not a little troubling to me that his vice-presidential pick is a Californian, just as so many of his plans to spend, tax and regulate have “designed in California” all over them. Yes, folks, California is America fast forward. Can someone please hit pause?This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Niall Ferguson is the Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Schwab said the sharp reduction in long-term rates has led to an acceleration of prepayment activity in the mortgage-backed securities held within its investment portfolio, which is impacting net interest margin, and leading to third-quarter revenue that is running &quot;slightly lower&quot; than second-quarter results. The current FactSet consensus for third-quarter revenue of $2.51 billion implies 2.3% growth from second-quarter revenue of $2.45 billion. Separately, Schwab said total client assets at the end of August was $4.49 trillion, up 5% increase from the end of July and a 21% rise from a year ago. Client cash as a percentage of assets was 12.5% in August, down from 13.0% in July but up from 11.3% a year ago. &quot;Thus far in the third quarter, equity market returns have been quite strong and client trading activity very robust relative to prior years,&quot; said Chief Executive Peter Crawford. &quot;At the same time, continued compression of interest rates has been pressuring investment yields.&quot; The stock has slumped 24.9% year to date through Monday, while the S&P 500  has gained 4.7%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8e5c42f2-da8f-318c-be45-52621958ce54/charles-schwab%26%2339%3Bs-stock.html?.tsrc=rss

On the other hand, Bank of America's 18 cent dividend rate, even if it seems modest, yields 2.82%. It was a nice ballast to have when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 12% over 10 days.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's like the old investment adage. You don't diversify your portfolio to make money. You diversify it to keep the money you have. A Bank Going NowhereIn a recent report, Bank of America analysts could have been describing themselves. Value stocks are &quot;broken,&quot; they wrote. While tech has been flying, stocks like Bank of America remain in neutral.Forget the awards that CEO Brian Moynihan is racking up.  Forget how the bank is finally integrating its brokerage operations into its apps, as rivals like Charles Schwab (NASDAQ:SCHW) did years ago.  * 7 Sin Stocks to Buy Now as America ReopensLook at the basics. At its Sept. 10 opening price of about $25.45 per share, BAC stock was selling at less than 13 times earnings, and there's that dividend. The bank's market cap is $221 billion. That's roughly the value of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). A 100-year old bank is worth little more than a 25-year old streaming service.How is that possible? One reason is that the bank's revenue has been stagnant for three years now. Its merchant card processing, provided by Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), is barely competitive.  If you or your business need to borrow money, there are easier ways to do it. Even the mortgage business is being taken over by non-bank banks.  A Bank Running RightDespite the caution there are analysts saying buy BAC stock. In fact, they're saying you should buy it because of the caution.Shares are down 27% for the year, but with a well-run company that's called a bargain. When fear rises, as it did early this month, big banks start looking attractive. The bank got through the pandemic panic of the second quarter in good shape. An improving economy later this year and into next year means it could soon start buying back its stock again. Even a rumor of buybacks' return will boost the price of BAC stock.Bank of America isn't just cheap compared with tech stocks. It's cheaper than most other banks. The price-to-book ratio is below 1. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is trading at about 1.3 times book.The stock's latest drop was caused by a rise in reserves for credit losses. That is, it didn't see more losses, it just booked reserves against them. Trading revenues and fees from investment banking were up sharply in the most recent quarter.Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) is still Bank of America's largest shareholder. It's his second-biggest position, after Apple. He says, &quot;banking is a good business if you don't do dumb things.&quot; Bank of America isn't doing dumb things.  Big banks get 12% returns on net tangible assets, and no bond can do that without spectacular risk. The Bottom Line on BAC StockA trader, like our John Jagerson or Wade Hansen of Strategic Trader, can use covered calls in Bank of America to protect their portfolio.I prefer to think of a bank stock as the ballast in my portfolio. It doesn't power me ahead, but it gives me stability in heavy weather like we've seen in September. If your portfolio is big enough to need ballast, here's how you get it.On the date of publication, Danma Blankenhorn owned shares in BAC and AAPL.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial journalist since 1978.

2020-08-31	2020-08-31 20:50:39	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Robinhood, Schwab and Other Brokers Resolve Online Glitches	(Bloomberg) -- Robinhood Markets and three other online brokers said they resolved disruptions on their platforms Monday after a morning of glitches affected thousands of customers.Robinhood, which had problems related to equities, options and cryptocurrency trading, said shortly after noon in New York that the issues were fixed. TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., Vanguard Group and Charles Schwab Corp. also reported difficulties, including slowness with websites and mobile apps, that resulted in user complaints.Clients eager to make trades on the last day of the month were stymied as U.S. markets opened. Speculation online focused on whether some of the problems were related to Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. stock splits that took effect Monday.Self-guided traders stuck home during the Covid-19 pandemic have helped give online brokers a boost this year. Second-quarter retail U.S. equity trading volume surged more than 50% from the preceding three-month period, according to Larry Tabb, head of market structure research for Bloomberg Intelligence.While online brokerages routinely experience brief outages, it’s rarer for several of them to happen simultaneously. Downdetector listed more than 2,900 complaints for Robinhood and more than 7,000 for Ameritrade.Judy Burns, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission spokeswoman, declined to comment, and a spokesperson for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Trading SurgeRobinhood, which has helped lead gains in online trading this year, is the subject of an investigation by regulators into its handling of an outage in March, Bloomberg News reported Monday.It wasn’t immediately clear whether the latest disruptions are related. Vanguard said full access to its websites, mobile apps and phones had been restored and apologized to customers.

2020-08-31	2020-08-31 16:42:00	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Popular trading platforms TD Ameritrade, Robinhood, and others faced outages early Monday as Tesla and Apple stocks split	Users of a number of popular trading platforms on Monday complained of downed systems, slowness and an inability to trade, coming as two of the two most prominent stocks were trading on a split-adjusted basis for the first time. TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch told MarketWatch that the issue has since been resolved but noted that clients had &quot;experienced high levels of slowness on the TD Ameritrade web platforms and the TD Ameritrade mobile app.&quot; She said the company was &quot;working with impacted clients to address any concerns they may have.&quot; A Robinhood spokeswoman said that &quot;some customers were experiencing issues with delayed order status updates,&quot; but said that the issue was fixed and &quot;Robinhood is operational.&quot; &quot;We apologize for the inconvenience,&quot; the Robinhood spokeswoman said. Neither platform commented on the cause of the slowness or delays. Joe Saluzzi, partner, co-head of Equity Trading at Themis Trading, told MarketWatch that he has been observing a wave of stocks changing hands in Tesla  and Apple shares  and wondered if this could be causing some problems with various online trading systems. &quot;It's an enormous amount of volume. You can't even blink and they're going through.&quot; A message from a Twitter handled associated with PJ Matlock, CEO of Atlas Trading in New Jersey, said that Vanguard, Charles Schwab , and Robinhood were experiencing issues on Monday. He suggested that a wider problem was at play across the Street. The problems come as Apple Inc.  has completed a 4-for-1 stock split and Tesla Inc.  also has split its stock 5-for-1. A number of other changes were taking place in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , including the inclusion of Amgen , Salesforce.com  and Honeywell International . Calls to the other trading platforms weren't immediately returned. Saluzzi said that the problems had appeared to be relegated to the retail platforms, as he didn't see any problems in professional trading systems. Of the likelihood it was associated with the changes occurring in the Dow and with Tesla and Apple, the trading pro said: &quot;Nothing is coincidental.&quot;	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/96672a23-650d-3dea-bc7d-7d98ca946e3d/popular-trading-platforms-td.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-28	2020-08-28 15:14:11	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	3 Top-Performing Active-Equity Funds From Schwab In 2020	As you probably already know, 2020 has been somewhat of a roller coaster ride for many stocks and funds. This volatile environment hasn't prevented Schwab's list of actively-managed stock funds from finding daylight, though.Here are three funds in particular that have done well during the virus outbreak.Schwab Health Care Fund™ (SWHFX)COVID-19 has given a boost to the health care sector in 2020, and Schwab's actively-managed health care fund is no exception to the rule. SWHFX is up 7.2% so far this year. This return is more than 2% higher than the S&P 500 Health Care index over the same period.Like other securities in 2020, SWHFX  had a rough journey in March, bottoming out on March 23 at more than 25% in the red for the year. But it bounced back quickly as panic subsided and investors realized that health care stocks might actually benefit from the outbreak.Schwab's health care fund invests in a wide variety of companies connected to health care--from hospitals to biotech firms to pharmaceutical manufacturers. So SWHFX delivers exposure to a wide swath of the health care sector.Stocks in the fund include:  * Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ)  * Merck & Co (NYSE: MRK)  * Pfizer (NYSE: PFE)  * UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH)  * Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN)  * Medtronic (NYSE: MDT)  * Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD)   Roughly 20% of the holdings trade on foreign exchanges, which is above average for the category. Switzerland is the largest country represented after the United States.Although Schwab's fund is actively managed, it has an expense ratio of just 80 basis points, a low number for an active fund.SWHFX comes with no load and has no transaction fee when purchased at Schwab. It has 3 stars from Morningstar.Schwab Large-Cap Growth Fund™ (SWLSX)Although Schwab's health care fund has done well during the virus pandemic, the company's large-cap growth fund is on a completely different level. SWLSX has delivered a very impressive 21.9% increase so far this year. That's light years ahead of the S&P 500, which is around 6% YTD.And just how exactly has Schwab's large-cap growth fund managed to deliver such an impressive performance? By investing in large U.S.-based companies, such as:  * Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)  * Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)  * Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)  * Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  * Facebook (NASDAQ: FB)  * Mastercard (NYSE: MA)SWLSX manages its portfolio for 99 basis points per year. While this is a little steep, the fund's performance does seem to justify the cost. This is also true on a long-term basis. The fund has a 10-year annualized return of 15.9%, very impressive by any standard. The S&P 500, for example, has returned 14.9% over the same period.Morningstar gives Schwab's fund 3 stars out of 5 for its overall performance; while Lipper grades the fund a 5 out of 5 across all time frames.Schwab Core Equity Fund™ (NYSE: SWANX)Rounding out our list of the 3 best-performing assets on Schwab's list of actively-managed mutual funds is SWANX. The core equity fund attempts to beat the S&P 500 index with active management. The fund team consists of three managers with an average tenure of 7 years.And how have they done? Their fund has a 10-year annualized return of 13.4%. In 2019, SWANX delivered a very impressive 29.5%. So far in 2020, the fund has returned 5.5%, a decent performance given the difficult circumstances.Schwab's core equity fund invests at least 80% of its assets in U.S. companies that are expected to grow over time. Thus, the fund focuses on long-term capital appreciation instead of dividends.Nevertheless, some holdings do pay dividends. Top stocks in the portfolio include:  * Microsoft  * Intel (NYSE: INTC)  * Facebook  * JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM)  * Allstate (NYSE: ALL)SWANX has itself paid out at least one dividend every year for the past 24 years.In return for its long performance, SWANX has received 3 stars from both Morningstar and Lipper. Although these aren't the best ratings, the core equity fund only charges 73 basis points per year for its management.As with Schwab's other funds, there is no minimum investment amount; so it's possible to start with just $1 to get into the fund.See more from Benzinga  * Why Shutterstock's Stock Is Trading Higher Today  * Why Medigus's Stock Is Trading Higher Today  * Dell Analysts React To Q2 Earnings Beat: 'Ride The Wave Of Remote Work'(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-13	2020-08-13 16:00:24	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Fractional Shares Expose Wall Street Greed	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It used to be that novices went about investing the right way. They bought low-cost mutual or exchange-traded funds using the dollar-cost averaging strategy and held them for years. But a gigantic stock market rally since late March seems to have inspired millions of new investors. And instead of being confined to relatively safe, stodgy funds, they now have the ability to buy so-called fractional shares, or less than one share of stock. This is giving more people access to the stock market than ever before. I would not characterize this as progress.Back in the days of pin-striped suits, suspenders and bull and bear cufflinks, one used to have to buy a “round lot” of 100 shares to invest in the stock market. The cost to do so could easily run into the the thousands of dollars. Sure, “odd lots” of less than 100 shares were permitted, but they were frowned upon because such trades were more expensive for brokers to executive and not worth the effort. This did a pretty good job of keeping uninformed investors out of the market and from hurting themselves financially.Now, the business of executing trades has become more efficient and less costly, with many platforms now offering such services. This has led to something called the democratization movement, which believes that everyone should have the ability to trade stocks even if they don’t have enough money to buy even one share, let alone 100 shares. Firms ranging from Charles Schwab Corp. to Robinhood Financial LLC and  Social Finance Inc. now allow investors to buy a fraction of a share for as little as $5 or less. Stash Investments LLC even has a “stock back” debit card that  offers share rewards on purchases, according to Bloomberg News. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Fidelity Investments, which rolled out fractional trading to customers in January and February, says more than 340,000 of its accounts have placed a fractional trade.Someone who has only $5 to invest should not be putting that money into stocks; they should be buying food. Nobody is saving for retirement $5 at a time. This is rank speculation, and most of it is on the high-flying tech companies that have mostly refused to split their stocks.(2) Only three members of the S&P 500 Index have split their stocks this year, and more than 30% have gone without doing so since 2000 or longer, according to Bloomberg News.(1)I doubt there is much in the way of profit for discount brokers in trading fractional shares, but what they are really hoping for is that all these small accounts will one day turn into large accounts. In that sense, fractional shares are a gimmick, designed to ensnare small, unsophisticated investors into becoming paying clients. Commission-free trading was a gimmick, too, as commissions have only really represented a small part of overall revenue in recent years.Stunts like these would be difficult to pull off in a bear market. But the brokerages have been successful in appealing to people’s greed, along with Instagram accounts featuring pictures of infinity pools and Lamborghinis supposedly bought with the proceeds of day trading. Numerous studies on the performance of small investors, including one from Brad Barber and Terrance Odean of University of California at Berkeley, show that they tend to underperform the market by holding “under-diversified portfolios” and “trading actively, speculatively, and to their detriment,” and that “individual investors earn poor returns even before costs.” Most ordinary people are psychologically hard-wired to behave in suboptimal ways when it comes to investing, and fractional shares are just another way for discount brokerages to facilitate this behavior. Even Vanguard, one the few firms that does not appeal to investors’ sense of greed, acknowledges that many investors actively trade their mutual fund offerings, leading to diminished performance.History shows that the vast majority of these new traders chasing hot stocks will lose money and probably end up worse off than if they had never invested in stocks. Democratization of the stock market will fail, leading to a generation of investors distrusting Wall Street and perhaps even capitalism. Investors are most successful when they hire qualified financial advisors and pay sales charges on mutual funds and high commissions, which encourage them to buy investments and hold them for long periods of time. We have to let go of the idea that everyone should own and trade stocks because people are emotionally unfit to do so.(1) Apple Inc. said July 30 it would split its shares 4-for-1as the stock price surged toward $400, and Tesla Inc. announced a 5-for-1 stock split on Aug. 11 as it's shares reached around $1,400.(2) The disappearance of stock splits is one of the sadder stories of modern finance. In the past, the idea was that a company would want its stock price to be more accessible to a broader range of investors. These days, there’s the misguided notion that the higher a stock price, the more successful the company. And yet, there is evidence that liquidity deteriorates at high stock prices, which benefits neither the company nor its shareholders.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Jared Dillian is the editor and publisher of The Daily Dirtnap, investment strategist at Mauldin Economics, and the author of &quot;Street Freak&quot; and &quot;All the Evil of This World.&quot; He may have a stake in the areas he writes about.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinionSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fractional-shares-expose-wall-street-160024916.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-24	2020-07-24 14:42:58	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Yieldstreet Review: Prepare for Risks When You Say ‘Bye’ to Advisors	For a decade, the cloud has been eliminating financial middlemen. Stockbrokers, real estate agents, insurance agents, brokers -- they're all disappearing under the wave of fintech innovation.Source: Kenishirotie / Shutterstock.com Investment advisors are now in the crosshairs at Yieldstreet. It's a market for &quot;alternative investments,&quot; the kind that only &quot;accredited investors&quot; can make. Since its founding in 2015, it has been growing like a weed.In its first three years, Yieldstreet moved $560 million, mostly in real estate and commercial financings. In 2019 it more than doubled that. It also made two acquisitions, moving into self-directed IRAs and the financing of fine art.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe company has also made some big-time friends. It has a strategic partnership with Citigroup (NYSE:C) on some of its private credit investments. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) even launched a closed-end fund with Yieldstreet. Yieldstreet Review: How It WorksInvesting with Yieldstreet isn't like opening a Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) account. You need to prove you're accredited, which requires income of at least $200,000 or a net worth of $1 million.This is not as big a hurdle as it seems. An estimated 12.4 million households meet the threshold, nearly one in 10. Most accredited investors are aged 50-70.Once you prove your worth, you link your bank account to Yieldstreet's Evolve Bank & Trust, insured for up to $250,000, and you can start investing. The Evolve account is the start of a &quot;wallet&quot; through which you invest.  * 10 Cybersecurity Stocks We Need Now More Than Ever Deals on Yieldstreet look a little like equity crowdfunding ideas you'll see on sites like StartEngine or AngelList. The difference is that these are real financings, the kind banks and brokers do. Things like multi-family housing projects, short-term notes, oil tankers, commercial and industrial properties and even art collections. Many deals close in less than a day. Why Do It?The motivation is in the name. Yield. Millions of tech workers are now approaching retirement, with decades of experience using the web. Many, like myself, have been using platforms like Charles Schwab for years. We'd like to have a first-class retirement and leave something behind for our kids. There's also some ego involved. We like to think we're as smart as the people who claim to advise us.But Yieldstreet investors are taking on the same risks big banks do. A recent deal to finance scrap ships for over $89.2 million may have been fraudulent. The Dubai firm behind the deal denies the charges and claims its reputation is being tarnished.Some 30 customers complained directly to Yieldstreet about their payments. What looks like a shortfall in due diligence caused BlackRock to pull out of its Yieldstreet deal, which was called the Yieldstreet Prism Fund.Then there's real estate. The novel coronavirus is opening the market with borrowers desperate for re-financing. A lot of rent isn't getting paid on office buildings, strip malls and apartment blocks. Just like the big banks, Yieldstreet investors will be hurt by deals going bad and should be pickier.But will they be? Or are they being treated as suckers? That's Yieldstreet's challenge. The Bottom Line on My Yieldstreet ReviewBanks and brokers take on big risks all the time. They have huge pools of money to invest. If you're not taking some loan losses, the saying goes, you're not taking enough risk.But investors aren't banks. Even taking a piece of someone's package may represent a big chunk of our capital. We figure if a bank or broker has blessed a deal, it's a good one. We expect due diligence. We're customers.But there is a cost to diligence. If sites like Yieldstreet pay those costs, the money must come from investors or borrowers, and it's not spread out across as much capital as at Citibank.There's a price in reaching for yield. It's called risk. Make sure you understand that before going to Yieldstreet.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

2020-07-22	2020-07-22 15:08:44	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Citi Says the ‘Quantum Leap’ in Retail Trading May Not Last	(Bloomberg) -- Profits at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., and its buyer Charles Schwab Corp., have been goosed by a “quantum leap” in retail trading volume that may be set to fade, according to Citi.Fiscal third-quarter earnings at TD Ameritrade beat analyst William Katz’s expectations. But now the stock faces a “pivot point” around the sustainability of surging retail engagement that’s been “catalyzed by the Covid-19 backdrop,” according to Katz.“If this is indeed the new normal, our stand-alone and pro-forma estimates could be sharply too low,” Katz wrote in a note. “But, history would suggest such engagement may not be fully sustainable, leaving us a bit in the show-us camp.”Katz revised his estimates to assume greater trading activity but also to account for an “easing pace of growth and net interest income contribution.” Additionally, he lifted his price target for TD Ameritrade to $42 from $41, and for Schwab to $38.50 from $38. For both, he said “residual upside is a bit shy to step into the stocks, particularly given some potential tax rate risk emerging with [the] U.S. election and whether investors want to chase the retail engagement cycle.”TD Ameritrade fell as much as 1.4% in Wednesday morning trading; Schwab slipped as much as 1.6%. Both have underperformed so far this year, with TD Ameritrade down 24% and Schwab falling 26%, versus a 0.8% gain for the S&P 500.On Tuesday, Toronto-Dominion Bank said its stake in TD Ameritrade will help cushion the earnings blow from the coronavirus pandemic as TD Ameritrade posted third-quarter profit that beat the highest analyst estimate, thanks to the boom in retail trading seen across electronic brokerages.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citi-says-quantum-leap-retail-150844932.html?.tsrc=rss

That’s a record quarterly contribution in the 14 years since Toronto-Dominion sold its U.S. brokerage and received part of the combined TD Ameritrade.Earlier Tuesday, TD Ameritrade, which is being purchased by Charles Schwab Corp., reported third-quarter adjusted earnings that beat the highest analyst estimate thanks to a retail trading boom seen across electronic brokerages during the pandemic. Toronto-Dominion, which owns about 43% of TD Ameritrade, reports the brokerage’s contribution in its U.S. retail division.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-trading-boom-gives-td-213159177.html?.tsrc=rss

Since then, Palampougioukis' bet has paid off as Tesla's share price has increased more than six-fold, trading around $1,500 on Monday and surpassing every rival to become the world's highest-valued automaker. &quot;To me it didn't feel like a bet because I studied what Tesla does very closely and it's simply inevitable that it would dominate,&quot; Palampougioukis said, adding that he plans to own the shares for decades.	https://ca.news.yahoo.com/tesla-share-rally-propels-early-172151676.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-13	2020-07-13 01:43:24	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Hong Kong Gets Zero-Fee Trading in Blow to Brokers	(Bloomberg) -- Less than a year since Charles Schwab Corp. reshaped the U.S. discount broker industry with zero-fee trading, a Hong Kong firm is following suit in a move set to deepen the pain for the city’s many hard-pressed trading houses.As of last month, Huatai International, the Hong Kong arm of China’s third largest broker, is no longer charging commissions and platform fees for stock trades, but just a HK$8 ($1) monthly fee. It has seen a surge in customers, gaining more users over the past month than it has over the past three years, according to Zhu Yali, the firm’s head of the fintech and retail business, who declined to give specific numbers.The move could have a knock-on effect across the sector, putting pressure on rivals who are already suffering under thin margins. Battling an influx of online trading and mainland China rivals, growing dominance of big banks, political unrest and an economic slump, Hong Kong’s brokers are closing shop at a record pace this year.Read more: Hong Kong’s Small Brokers Are Disappearing at a Record PaceHuatai is leaning on its deep pockets -- its trading app in China has 7.8 million active monthly users -- and trimmed costs to make up for the lost income, betting it can replicate a mainland strategy of folding new customers into its broader wealth management business. By cutting fees to zero, the broker is forgoing HK$150 million to HK$200 million in fees for every 100,000 clients, according to Zhu.“Hong Kong is a very competitive market,” Zhu said. “Other brokers will have to follow in order to maintain existing client base or to acquire new clients.”Huatai Securities rose as much as 2.3% in early Hong Kong trading. It has gained about 13% so far this year on the back of surging trading volumes amid a boom in China’s market. Charles Schwab’s move to go to zero fees in October quickly shook up the U.S. industry, with domestic discount rivals and even mutual fund giants such as Vanguard and Fidelity following suit. Charles Schwab sealed a $26 billion takeover of rival TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. just a month later.But Hong Kong has features that will make it hard for many brokers to match Huatai. One issue is that they can’t make up for lost income through order flow payments. U.S. brokers are able to provide free trading partly because of this practice, in which they sell customer orders to wholesale market makers who profit off the bid and offer spread.Louis Mak, chief executive officer of low-fee broker I-Access Group Ltd, said passing on retail client trades is considered controversial by many in the industry in Hong Kong. The city only has one stock exchange as well, making it hard for brokers to reap compensation as their U.S. counterparts can from multiple bourses.“That’s why throughout the years Hong Kong brokers’ fee war are genuine price wars,” said Mak, whose firm won’t follow Huatai in offering zero trading fees.Other competitors look at it as a gimmick that’s hard to replicate and that could also be met by suspicion from long-time customers.“They would question how the company could stay afloat with such high rents and fixed costs in Hong Kong,” said Edmond Hui, CEO of Bright Smart Securities. Charging a commission of 0.0668% on trades, Hui is also not budging on the level for his 338,000 clients across the city.Commission income is sizable in Hong Kong. Last year, the city’s brokers earned HK$19.9 billion in such fees, which was down 18% from the previous year. Trading has picked up this year though, stoked by volatility from the coronavirus, helping to ease some of the pain. The average trading commission in Hong Kong is about 0.073%, according to data collected from nine of the most popular brokers.Some 23 of the city’s brokers have ceased trading this year, exceeding last year’s record 22.Big global banks that handle much of the trading in the city are unlikely to be affected since they handle mostly institutional customers.Kenny Wen, a Hong Kong-based wealth management strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co., is also skeptical that fees can go much lower, saying that the top tier brokerages will need to compete by offering better services and more research support.The small brokerages are “already offering very low commission rates and I don’t think they have much room to cut them further,” he said.(Updates with Huatai shares in the sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zero-fee-trading-hong-kong-040000851.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-02	2020-07-02 14:36:17	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Buy Nasdaq Stock As the Tech Boom Accelerates	The market has had an astounding 2020 so far, and nowhere was this more true than in the tech sector. People are using tech more than ever in all facets of life. That, in turn, is powering a huge run in tech stocks. Yet the exchange where all this is happening, the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ), is barely up. In fact, Nasdaq stock is essentially flat since February.Source: Shutterstock In a gold rush, there's great money to be made selling mining equipment. Similarly, if you're going to have a boom in growth companies, Nasdaq is going to get its share of the pie.Historically, it certainly has. The Nasdaq's earnings have more the doubled over the past six years as stocks have rallied. And now, with tech making another surge higher to record levels, it's an ideal time to get long the stock exchange where the magic is happening.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Nasdaq: It's More Diversified Than You RealizeAt first glance, you might assume that Nasdaq is a simple business. It earns money from companies that list on the exchange, right? And yes, that's true. However, it does far more than that.In fact, the Nasdaq has four major revenue streams. According to its latest annual report, the largest segment, market services, accounts for just 36% of revenues. You also have information services at 31%, corporate services at 20%, and market technology bringing in the other 13%. That's an outstanding level of internal diversification.  * 7 Utilities Stocks to Buy With Reassuring DividendsA stock exchange such as Nasdaq gets paid from activities that facilitate trading, from corporate events such as initial public offerings, and also information services such as selling data to brokerages and trading firms. On top of that, Nasdaq has built an ancillary business selling related financial technology and service products.The most exciting of the bunch right now is the data business. The Nasdaq (and the other stock exchanges) are arms dealers in the ever-escalating war among different algorithmic trading shops and high frequency trading firms.These active traders need the best data and are willing to pay heavily for it. That data, in turn, is a natural monopoly, as there are very few national stock exchanges, and Nasdaq in particular has a bunch of proprietary data. The Core Business Is Humming AlongWhile data is obviously a hot market right now, given the rise of high frequency trading, the core market services business is also good. Just look around. The Nasdaq composite just hit a new all-time high a few weeks ago, despite the coronavirus.It's not hard to see why, as tech stocks are flying. Cloud and software-as-a-service are particularly in favor; many names in those sectors have doubled or more since the March lows.This is good for bringing more trading activity and other related business. And that's not all. Don't forget that a major reason capital markets exist, after all, is to raise money for companies. When markets are booming that means you're going to see far more IPOs and also secondary offerings in existing equities.Who gets paid when a new tech stock sells its shares to the public? If you said the Nasdaq's shareholders, you're catching on. Nasdaq Stock Is Attractively PricedIt's not hard to find solid growth companies in the current marketplace. In fact, with all the problems that many other sectors are having, investors are rushing into the technology sector. However, it's much rarer to find a reasonably priced growth stock today.However, Nasdaq stock is still available at a fine price. Nasdaq earned $4.63 a share in 2019, and analysts forecast that it would earn more than $5.50 in 2020. We'll see if that comes through or not, given the economic shock. In any case, shares have a forward price-earnings ratio in the low 20s. That's a great level for Nasdaq. Consider that Nasdaq has grown its earnings 14% per year compounded over the past 10 years.Nasdaq has also been a massive dividend growth machine. The company initiated its dividend in 2012 at 39 cents a share per year. Since then, it has more than quadrupled its dividend, as it paid out $1.85 per share last year. With a payout ratio of less than 40%, there's more room for outsized dividend growth -- particularly if the 14% per year EPS growth rate continues as well. Nasdaq Stock VerdictNasdaq is an excellent opportunity at current prices. In fact, it's worth asking why the stock price isn't higher already, given the compelling growth rate.I suspect Nasdaq is undervalued now because investors are falsely comparing it to brokerages. The brokers have gotten into a pricing war, with commissions falling to $0 per trade at many places. This has caused stocks like Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) to underperform.In theory, trading and data fees for the stock exchanges could plummet as well. In practice, this is unlikely as it is far harder to create new stock exchanges that have critical mass. The entrenched players have economic motive to preserve the status quo.Additionally, some investors fear that Fintech start-ups will disrupt the stock exchanges. So far, however, most start-ups aimed at finance have failed to transform existing systems. Things such as credit card companies, which were supposed to be obsolete by now, instead keep making record profits.Long story short, Nasdaq is riding two big waves going forward. The first is a fundamental rise in financial sophistication. Traders are using more and more data, and they have to buy it from a few select vendors, including Nasdaq.The second is that tech stocks are booming. And that may continue for quite a while as the economy reshapes itself in a post Covid-19 world.All that adds up to record earnings for Nasdaq and a stock price that will keep moving higher.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

2020-07-01	2020-07-01 11:56:01	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Closing the Generation Gap in Stocks May Be Market’s Next Act	(Bloomberg) -- While frenetic buying by retail investors gets all the press for driving the recovery in stocks, the beachhead established by newly minted Robinhood day traders was always a tenuous one. Now Wall Street is getting excited about a potentially bigger and more powerful force that is led by older Americans with more money.It’s a case stock bulls are increasingly drawn to after a stellar second quarter fizzled out in a disappointing June. Equity strategists are eying the intentions of a more affluent middle-aged set that remained mostly unmoved by the frenzy that broke out in chatrooms and elsewhere in April and May, scene of the fastest S&P 500 rally in nine decades.For all the bullishness among the Robinhood crowd, there’s still among older generations a healthy dose of pessimism, a sentiment that appeals to contrarians. Evidence of their skepticism surfaced as money flowed out of equity funds last quarter, vehicles that JPMorgan Chase & Co. says are preferred by older hands. Cash at retail brokerages like Charles Schwab Corp. remain near a record high and the latest survey from the American Association of Individual Investors showed bears outnumbered bulls by a ratio of 2-to-1.“The older generations of U.S. retail investors has been so far more cautious on equities than the new generation,” JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note. “The equity buying by retail investors will likely strengthen as the older cohorts, which have so far preferred to extract any remaining value in credit via buying corporate bond funds, will switch later in the year into equity funds.”As everyone knows by now, small-time day traders, armed with stimulus money and possibly in search of distraction with casinos and sports leagues closed, rose up as a formidable force in the rally that began in March and lifted the S&P 500 by 44%. Their presence on the free investing app Robinhood dominated headlines, as favored industries like airlines and hotels roared back in the rebound.According to data compiled by Vanda Research on account openings, to date most of the new money has gone into Robinhood. The platform opened 3 million new accounts from January to early May, more than double the combined openings of Schwab, Interactive Brokers Group Inc. and E*TRADE Financial Corp.One thing researchers have noticed is the demographics of those buyers, which varies depending on their point of entry. The average age of Robinhood investors is around 30, at least 15 years younger than the typical user at TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab.JPMorgan analysts say there’s reason to believe older users will soon be forced to loosen their own purse strings when it comes to stocks, particularly if the recovery lasts and investors have to embrace more risk taking.At Schwab, clients generally still favor bonds over stocks, according to Liz Ann Sonders, the firm’s chief investment strategist. At the same time, she says, new accounts are skewing toward a younger demographic, a trend that bodes well for the market.“In the last cycle, there was an assumption that we’re never going to get younger folks interested in investing,” Sonders said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “If we step back and try to find the glass half full here, it is hopeful that we’re attracting younger people to the whole notion of investing.”Read: Wall Street Fixates on a College Side Project Tracking RobinhoodThe direction of retail money has never mattered more than now, in a market where corporate repurchases are dwindling and Goldman Sachs anticipates household demand to step into the void left from a dearth of buybacks. While the frenzy among Robinhood traders has sparked some comparison between today and the dot-com bubble, the broader orientation of retail participation is much less exuberant.Take fund flows. Investors have pulled $7 billion out of mutual and exchange-traded funds that focus on equities since the market’s bottom in March, according to data from Investment Company Institute. That brought the total withdrawals for 2020 to $84 billion.Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, notes persistent skepticism among the firm’s rich clients, who are mostly older and may be more sensitive to the Covid-19 health risk. Another source of concern for this cohort, he says, is the uncertainty over the presidential election, but this too shall pass once the economy finds its footing, he said.“We don’t think retail money has been driving the rally but see potential for this as the recovery path becomes clearer,” Wilson wrote in a note. “While it’s unlikely either of these issues will be completely resolved in the near term, we think they will and simply add to the wall of worry that may lead to positive inflows later this year.”And the older generation has abundant money to put to use. Client cash at brokerage firms has stayed elevated despite a second-quarter rally that’s the best since 1998. At Schwab, cash accounted for 14% of client assets in May, a level that before March would have surpassed any time since at least 2014.“Boomers and Gen X investors have plenty of dry powder to buy stocks in the next three to six months,” said Ben Onatibia, a strategist at Vanda. “Keep tracking millennials but don’t forget boomers.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/closing-generation-gap-stocks-may-115601734.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-29	2020-06-29 12:19:10	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Wall Street Theories on Billions Sloshing Through Schwab Funds	(Bloomberg) -- More than $8 billion is on the move in Charles Schwab Corp.’s exchange-traded funds, stirring speculation the firm could be adjusting the packaged strategies it offers clients as markets gyrate amid the pandemic.Over the past seven trading days, $4.6 billion has exited from a group of four ETFs including Schwab’s fundamental equity and intermediate-maturity Treasury funds. The firm’s emerging-market equity and inflation-focused bond offerings were among four products to rake in $3.9 billion at the same time.Schwab is the biggest holder of all of the funds, according to the latest available filings.The size of the flows -- more than half of the funds posted at least one record daily flow in the period -- and the broad range of ETFs involved is stirring speculation that Schwab is shifting exposure in its model portfolios.Such prefabricated packages of ETFs offer a one-stop solution to a client’s investment needs. Instead of spending time selecting individual funds, investors can pick a portfolio aligned with their goals and risk tolerance.It’s unclear how much cash follows such models, but it’s thought that when one makes a strategic shift, billions of dollars can move between ETFs.A Schwab spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the flows were a result of model portfolio reallocations, but acknowledged that the firm’s ETFs are used by a variety of such investments throughout the industry. Schwab’s own models run the spectrum from conservative income all the way to aggressive growth, according to its website.It’s not the only theory, however. Some strategists observe that pension fund withdrawals, a brightening outlook for emerging-market assets, or the lurking risk of an inflation uptick could be driving money in and out of the ETFs.Here are five views on what’s behind the Schwab flows:James Pillow, managing director at Moors & Cabot Inc.:With Schwab the largest holder in most of those funds, it probably is them. It makes sense. They were material contributors to equity exposure back in March. Those positions have had significant runs since then, so this looks like some well-earned profit taking. It is likely that pension funds holding these positions are adding to the withdrawals, as many are forced to reallocate some of the recent equity gains. Moving that liquidity to fixed income will keep them within their respective strategic asset allocation.Nate Geraci, president of investment-advisory firm the ETF Store:These certainly look like model portfolio shifts. The one note I’ll add is I think the interest in SCHP may be a bit broader. Given unprecedented government stimulus and Federal Reserve programs, I think some investors are seriously considering inflation for the first time in years. TIPS can serve as an excellent hedge and SCHP is meaningfully less expensive than its nearest competitor TIP.Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co.:It seems like a model portfolio. It could be a move because of the dollar. There’s growing concern the lower dollar is going to raise commodity prices, and the lower dollar obviously is very positive for emerging markets. I wonder if some of this is because some of these individual traders who have become so active are starting to move toward individual stocks. Instead of just buying ETFs, they are saying “I could get a bigger move out of an individual stock.”Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence:Given Charles Schwab is itself the largest holder of each of these products, it is likely the flows are driven by an internal model allocation change.Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA Research’s head of ETF and mutual fund research:This seems like a change in the asset allocation of some possibly in-house models and preferred usage of Schwab’s traditional beta-based ETFs and fundamental-based ETFs. The shift has been away from developed international equities with FNDF and small cap FNDA to emerging markets FNDE. But in addition, large cap SCHX has seen inflows while fundamental FNDX has outflows. FNDX has a value tilt and more exposure to financials and less exposure to information technology stocks than the more core focused SCHX.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-theories-billions-sloshing-121910797.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-19	2020-06-19 20:11:14	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Robinhood’s New Traders Ignore Danger Signs to Bet on Stocks	(Bloomberg) -- Rich hedge fund managers are talking about it. So are not-so-rich millennials. And fast-twitch gamers, and bored sports fans and -- in all likelihood -- some 15-year-olds you know.The “it” is Robinhood Financial’s trading app, which is throwing jet fuel on the speculative fires of coronavirus-era equity markets. Not since the dot-com mania of the 1990s, when starry-eyed day traders dreamed of online riches, has a brokerage platform drawn such a frenzied following. Skeptics warn the hype could set up home-bound novices for disaster.The rush of newbie investors flocking to Robinhood has sparked controversy over how much they’re influencing markets, and whether it’s appealing to those seeking to gamble at a time when casinos are closed and major sporting events are canceled.Robinhood drew more scrutiny this week after a young user’s death, which his family has called a suicide based on a note he left.Alexander Kearns, 20, killed himself after his Robinhood account showed a negative balance of more than $700,000, according to a series of tweets by his relative Bill Brewster. The figure may have been temporary and would have been updated when stocks underlying his assigned options settled to his account, according to Brewster. But Kearns believed it reflected how much leverage he had, according to the note, which was provided to Bloomberg by his family.Robinhood pledged to change elements of its options trading platform on Friday, in response to Kearns’s death. Its co-founders said they would alter how buying power is displayed in the app, and consider additional eligibility requirements for users seeking to employ more advanced options strategies. They also said Robinhood would make a $250,000 donation to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. “We are personally devastated by this tragedy,” according to the blog posting written by Baiju Bhatt and Vlad Tenev.“It is not lost upon us that our company and our service have become synonymous with retail investing in America, and that this has led to millions of new investors making their first investments through Robinhood,” they said. “We recognize this profound responsibility, and we don’t take it lightly. Our aspiration is to innovate, lead, and go beyond the status quo.”Trading LossesSome responses to Brewster’s posts show traders grappling with losses in the value of their holdings, while others have highlighted that even teenagers seem to be dabbling in the app.“They’re not super finance-savvy,” Brewster said of Kearns’s family in a phone interview this week. “I don’t even know that they would have known the questions to ask.”Robinhood’s popularity reflects one aspect of modern investing culture, said Alex Caswell, a wealth planner at RHS Financial. It fits into a community that includes everything from Reddit’s Wall Street Bets forum “where everything is seen as one big casino” to FinTwit (financial Twitter), and Barstool Sports’s Dave Portnoy livestreaming his day trading to millions of fans.“There is a culture that has been built around Robinhood,” Caswell said. “That culture doesn’t necessarily just come from the fact that Robinhood exists, rather Robinhood makes that culture easier to exist.”Confetti and RapMenlo Park, California-based Robinhood encourages stock market newcomers with an irreverent tone and mobile-friendly trading system. The app shows confetti shooting when a user makes a trade, and features lists of the most popular stocks on its platform. A business news podcast Robinhood airs, “Snacks Daily,” has used rap lyrics to issue legal disclaimers (“The snacks you’re about to hear ain’t food -- it’s ear candy/They don’t reflect the views of the Robinhood family.”)A Reddit page for Robinhood users has more than 300,000 members who share memes and “really dumb” questions. In April 2019, the page had about half as many members. There’s also a server for the app’s users on Discord, an online communication application originally built for gamers.Robinhood has learning tools listed on its website, and potential investors must complete an eligibility questionnaire before they can trade options. Users must be at least 18 years old to apply for an account.Applications go through a customer identification process that validates names, ages and Social Security numbers, among other details, according to a person familiar with Robinhood’s procedures.Half of Robinhood’s new customers this year have said they are first-time investors, according to the company. More than 2 million new accounts opened in the first quarter, exceeding the number of new users at Charles Schwab Corp., TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. and E*Trade Financial Corp. combined during that period.To accommodate the influx, Robinhood’s customer support team has grown by more than 40% this year, according to the person familiar with the company’s operations. By the end of 2020, it expects to have more than twice the support staff it had in January.Read more: Wall Street Fixates on a College Side Project Tracking RobinhoodBhatt and Tenev, Stanford University classmates, founded Robinhood in 2013 and started selling trading software to hedge funds after graduation. Two years after moving to New York, the pair returned to California to launch Robinhood, which is now worth about $8 billion. Both are billionaires.Earlier this year, as the coronavirus pandemic sparked violent swings in equities worldwide, Robinhood’s trading platform repeatedly failed, leaving millions of customers in the dark. Some pulled their accounts and went to competitors. On Thursday, Robinhood was down temporarily.As much as Robinhood portrays itself as an outsider in the financial world, it earns money in staid, traditional ways. The company relies on the same financial machinery that Schwab, E*Trade and other decades-old trading platforms do.Because the company doesn’t charge trading commissions -- which is now the industry standard for discount brokers -- it collects revenue in other ways. These include collecting interest income from uninvested customer cash, lending out securities and payment for order flow.Those who seek out Robinhood may crave a non-traditional trading experience and are likely to embrace the platform no matter what, said Cait Lamberton, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.“You don’t go to Robinhood unless you want what they’re offering,” she said. “People simply won’t show up who might be dissatisfied with the offer.”(Adds Robinhood changes and statement in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-newbie-traders-ignore-danger-110000334.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-12	2020-06-12 14:29:04	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Stock Strategist Says His Eye Doctor’s Kid Asked Him About Rally	(Bloomberg) -- In Wall Street’s old days, you were supposed to worry when a taxi driver mentioned the market. Not many of those are working right now. But Julian Emanuel says other proxies for overflowing risk appetite are out there. For instance, his eye doctor’s 16-year-old.“Can my kid talk to you?” the BTIG equity and derivatives strategist was asked last weekend by the doctor on behalf of the teenager, who’s out of work due to the lockdown and had been doing well with online stock trades.“From someone who was in there in ‘99 and ‘00 and could trade rapid fire with the best of them, it really made the hair on the back of my neck stand up,” said Emanuel in a phone interview. “What we’re seeing, I have not seen since 2000.” He’s convinced the conversation wasn’t a one-off: similar ones are happening across the country. He calls it Y2.02K.Not that it’s all bad, according to Emanuel -- there’s a big difference between today and when the dot-com bubble popped. Back then, a slowing economy, lofty valuations and the frenzy of activity suggested that 2000 was going to end badly. The recent rotation since the bottom into smaller and cyclical plays is more consistent with a potentially longer-lasting bull market cycle, he said. Emanuel isn’t changing his 2020 target for the S&P 500, which he sees ending the year at 3,000.“Long-term, this stepped-up participation by retail is a positive,” said Emanuel. “There’s a core of people participating in the markets either more frequently or for the first time that are going to end up being more dedicated investors, they will end up being a long-term source of equity demand.”Read more: Investors Ignore the Headlines and Keep Pushing Stocks UpFor Emanuel, who was a proprietary trader in the late 1990s at Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, the encounter is a sign of the times. A chance run-in with finance legend Charles Schwab spurred a bold call by the BTIG strategist late last year: a potential surge in stocks driven, in part, by the fee war that’s swept the asset management industry.That proved prescient, with the S&P 500 gaining over the past two months despite a growing list of overhanging concerns -- including, still, the coronavirus outbreak that shut down economies worldwide for months.Though tiny investors aren’t the only source of demand, they’ve been on an epic buying spree, evident in the record sign-ups at giant retail brokerages like TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. and Charles Schwab Corp. Many opened accounts at the depths of the crash and bought blue-chip stocks at steep discounts, as well as shares of so-called recovery firms including airlines, hotels and travel sites.Shawn Cruz, senior manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade, considers those reasonable investments for people with a long-term outlook. “What the thinking was is, ‘I don’t think Microsoft is going to go bankrupt, I don’t think Amazon is going to go bankrupt, but I know 5, 10 years from now, I’ll look back and maybe say I had an opportunity to buy some of these great names at very low prices.”On the other hand, there’s evidence of retail involvement in insolvency stocks like Hertz Global Holdings Inc. and Whiting Petroleum Corp. To Emanuel, that’s worrying -- an unwinding of retail participation in the near-term could be a catalyst for a downturn.ICYMI: Hundreds of Thousands of Tiny Buyers Swarm to Insolvency Stocks“What’s happening with some of these bankrupt companies, it used to be called colloquially ‘pump and dump,’” said Emanuel. “It’s just scary because when we see this kind of thing, it is the type of thing that typically throughout history has happened at market peaks.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-strategist-says-eye-doctor-142904462.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-11	2020-06-11 13:58:15	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	The Shift To Free Trading Provided A Valuable Lesson In Disruption	On April 18, 2013, a new company was created that completely upended the business model of trading commissions on Wall Street. For the next five and a half years, Robinhood and a bevy of other free trading apps that soon followed took aim at the retail brokerage industry, reaching valuations and acquiring new clients at a rate that indicated they were to be taken seriously by the Wall Street establishment. And taken seriously they were--so much so that every major retail brokerage finally threw in the towel on trading commissions in October. The decision by Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW), TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (NASDAQ: AMTD), E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ: ETFC), Fidelity, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc (NASDAQ: IBKR), and Tradestation to offer free trades for U.S. equity and options trades brought &quot;The Fee Wars&quot;--as it came to be known--to an abrupt end. It even directly led to Charles Schwab's decision to acquire rival TD Ameritrade for a reported $26 billion. Though trading fees had been under pressure for decades, and each of those firms deserves credit for adapting to what is clearly a changing competitive landscape, make no mistake: the final move to industry-wide free trading was Robinhood's doing. All of this was a precursor to today, where increased volatility and the elimination of trading fees has contributed to a record amount of retail trading in brokers like Robinhood and the major retail brokers.  This story is the typical path of disruption. A startup creates a new way of doing business (or in some cases, an entirely new market) and is so successful that everybody else is forced to adapt. But this can lead to the double-edged sword of disruption; what happens when the establishment (the ones being disrupted) move to disrupt the disruptor?This trend has a name: reverse innovation. And it's affecting more than just Robinhood. In fact, this very same pattern of reverse innovation has happened in other areas of finance. Over the last decade, companies like Wealthfront, Betterment, and Personal Capital have pioneered an entirely new kind of programmatic investing, bringing about the biggest changes to wealth management since Vanguard introduced the index fund in 1975. As recently as 2016, some estimates were projecting that robo-advisor assets under management would reach $1.5 trillion in 2019, $2.2 trillion in 2020, and $4.1 trillion in 2022 thanks in large part to the growth of those companies. Not only have those predictions not come to pass, but a look at the leading robo-advisors by AUM shows that for all of the acclaim heaped upon the companies who created modern robo-advising, it's the incumbents who have come to dominate the space. Of the top five robo-advisors who disclose their AUM, three are from Vanguard, Charles Schwab, and TD Ameritrade, according to data compiled by Investopedia as of September. With $161 billion AUM, Vanguard Personal Advisory Service is by far the largest robo-advisor in the market. This is followed by Schwab Intelligent Portfolios ($41 billion AUM), Wealthfront ($21 billion), TD Ameritrade Essential & Selective Portfolios ($19.9 billion) and Betterment ($18 billion). To be clear, nobody is suggesting that any of these champions of fintech are imminently doomed. All of the startups named above have a substantial number of accounts that give them a bit of a moat. In Robinhood's case, they reported having 6 million active users as of the end of 2018. But the company that has always touted its free commission structure and an easy-to-use app just lost one of its key competitive advantages. So it stands to reason that the nearly $8 billion valuation it received this summer surely lost some of its luster. &quot;When it comes to Wall Street and investing, the old guard has a lot of staying power, no matter what innovations come out of fintech,&quot; said Phill Rosen, CEO/Founder of Even Financial, a B2B platform for financial product offers that provides their channel partners the definitive search, comparison, and recommendation engine for financial services. &quot;This is true for all the categories in financial services, and personal loans, credit cards, and retail investing are no different. The new players are upping the ante, but the old guard isn't going to just roll over and die either.&quot; The lesson we can learn from Robinhood and the companies like it is they were so good at disrupting their industry, that maybe they were too good. If they want to survive (and maintain their lofty valuations), they're going to have to find new ways to once again differentiate themselves from the very companies they were aiming for in the first place.

2020-06-10	2020-06-10 14:43:52	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	One Trader Yanks $532 Million From TIPS Fund Before Price Data	(Bloomberg) -- A single investor is likely behind the record outflow from a Charles Schwab Corp. inflation-focused bond fund, just hours before U.S. consumer price data dropped.The $8.5 billion Schwab U.S. TIPS exchange-traded fund, ticker SCHP, saw over 9 million shares worth roughly $532 million hit the tape at 3:22 p.m. in New York on Tuesday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While it’s unclear if the trade -- the biggest in at least a year -- was to buy or sell shares, its size would account for nearly all of the fund’s $568 million outflow that day.Schwab, Bank of America Corp. and Voya Investment Management are the only firms with enough holdings in SCHP to make a trade that size, the data show.The record withdrawal came on the eve of Wednesday’s U.S. inflation report, which showed consumer prices declined in May for a third straight month and barely increased from a year earlier. Inflation-linked securities have struggled in recent months as the coronavirus pandemic crushed economic activity and ushered in a new era of central bank easing.SCHP gained 4.4% this year through Tuesday, lagging the performance of longer-dated Treasury ETFs.Following are the fund’s biggest holdings as of June 9:For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-trader-yanks-532-million-144352892.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-04	2020-06-04 14:00:46	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Schwab’s Deal for TD Ameritrade Wins Antitrust Approval	(Bloomberg) -- Charles Schwab Corp. won U.S. antitrust approval to buy rival TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., a $26 billion deal that further consolidates the brokerage industry.Schwab said Thursday that the Justice Department approved the deal, which the company expects to close in the second half of the year.Schwab estimates that integrating the businesses will take between 18 and 36 months following the close, it said.The tie-up tightens Schwab’s grip on an industry it pioneered. The deal, which was announced in November, came after Schwab cut its trading commissions to zero, in a move that roiled the entire sector. The combination shows the rush to consolidate customers in an industry that’s become more competitive over time. Besides wiping out commissions, prices for investment products and advice are coming down.Schwab’s shares rose as much as 2.5% in early trading in New York Thursday, and were up 0.7% at 9:58 a.m. TD Ameritrade’s stock gained 3.8%, having earlier risen as much as 5.5%.Still, the deal intensifies concentration in the industry. Smaller competitor E*Trade Financial Corp. sold itself to Morgan Stanley in February, marking the end of an era for standalone discount brokerages. That deal won antitrust approval from the Justice Department in March.The TD Ameritrade deal initially raised some antitrust concerns because it advances Schwab’s leading position as custodian for assets managed by financial advisers. The Justice Department didn’t respond to a request for comment. CNBC reported earlier the deal had won antitrust approval.(Adds deal’s integration timing in third paragraph, updates share price moves in fifth paragraph.

Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session.The stock is currently higher from its 52 week low by 33.14%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Capital Markets stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.Charles Schwab Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 35.54 of the capital markets industry. Ideally, one might believe that they might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued.There are many limitations to price to earnings ratio.

One analyst team sees continued pain in the company's future.The RatingBank of America's Michael Carrier downgraded Charles Schwab to a Neutral rating and cut the price target from $40 to $35.The ThesisThe analysts expect high unemployment to weaken Charles Schwab's growth.""Despite SCHW being a high quality company with attractive organic growth and AMTD deal synergies ahead, we expect rate headwinds, moderating net new assets (NNA) growth, and deal/integration/competitive risks to be an offset and limit earnings growth and the multiple over the coming year,"" Carrier wrote in a note.They anticipate the Fed maintaining interest rates at zero and the 10-year Treasury rates lingering below 1% for the foreseeable future. Even in the absence of other rate-pressuring policies, the current environment presents 5% downside risk to Bank of America's 2021 forecasts.""Schwab generates roughly 65% of its revenues from interest income and money market fees, both of which are rate sensitive,"" the analysts wrote. ""While we previously lowered our estimates for the impact from the Fed moving to zero, lower rates along the curve could have an ongoing impact and lower the growth outlook further.""Still, they remain generally positive on Charles Schwab long-term given the firm's second-quarter activity strength and first-quarter records in accounts, trading and new net assets metrics.""We expect Schwab to continue to put up industry leading growth and should gain further scale with the pending AMTD deal, though we expect some moderation ahead,"" Carrier and Murukutla wrote.SCHW Price ActionAt the time of publication, shares traded down marginally around $33.22.Related Links:Big Banks: Playing A Rebound Within The Financial SectorCharles Schwab Launches Fractional Shares, The Ability To Gift StockLatest Ratings for SCHW  DateFirmActionFromTo  May 2020B of A SecuritiesDowngradesBuyNeutral  May 2020Compass PointDowngradesBuyNeutral  May 2020Deutsche BankMaintainsHold    View More Analyst Ratings for SCHW   View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from Benzinga  * Improvement In US Weekly Jobless Number Weaker Than Expected, Continuing Claims Top 25M  * Southwest, United Start To See Signs Of Relief For Airline Industry  * Who Could Win, Lose As US Homebuilding Starts Decline: Home Depot 'Performing Well' During Coronavirus Crisis(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The investments start at a minimum of $5 and the maximum is $10,000, she said.As U.S. brokers and fund managers eliminate fees on stock trades and offer some other investments at no cost, many are turning to innovation to remain competitive and capture new customers. Schwab isn’t the first to introduce fractional investing for individual stocks -- Robinhood Financial LLC, Social Finance Inc. and Stash Investments LLC, among others, have launched similar products in the past two years.Fractional shares make investing more accessible for popular securities such as Facebook Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., whose prices are higher than the amounts many new investors have available, Hathi said.“Instead of investing one time, you can do it every week because it’s affordable,” said Brandon Krieg, co-founder and chief executive officer of Stash. “Customers invest in companies that they understand, and over time they move past fractions and into full shares.”The concept is simple: An investor chooses a desired dollar amount to invest, usually as low as $1, and gains a fraction of the total value of a share.On the back-end, brokerages hold inventory accounts of full shares and allocate portions of those to their customers as they are purchased. When a company doesn’t already hold a particular security desired by an investor, it purchases a full share from the market, gives a fraction of ownership to the customer and holds the rest in its portfolio.Fractional-share technology is also behind products such as Stash’s “stock back” debit card, which offers share rewards on purchases, and Robinhood’s recurring investments tool, which allows users to set up automated share purchases in designated amounts.The goal is to bring new, under-served customers into investing, Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi, said in an interview.“Innovations make investing more accessible to people, there’s an insatiable demand for it,” Noto said.(Updates with minimum and maximum in the second paragraph.

""Whether it's a new investor who simply wants to get started or someone more experienced who still finds the stock price of some companies daunting, giving investors the opportunity to buy small slices of stocks is an extremely powerful tool to help people get engaged.""With Stock Slices, investors can select a single stock or collection of stocks such as Amazon Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), and the total dollar amount invested is split evenly across each stock.Once trades are executed, the shares are accessible in the client's brokerage and can be sold individually. Additionally, Stock Slices offer users the ability to gift fractions of shares.""We developed Schwab Stock Slices to meet two important needs we heard from clients - newer investors who want the ability to buy multiple stocks in small dollar amounts and older more affluent investors who want to more easily gift stock ownership to younger generations,"" Hathi said.""This is our first use of fractional shares, and we're looking forward to exploring additional ways we can use the functionality to improve how clients invest.""To learn more about financial wellness with Stock Slices, please visit schwab.com/stockslices.Photo by bongkarn thanyakij from Pexels.See more from Benzinga  * Trading 212 Takes On Disciplined Investing With 'Next Generation Product'  * Options Trading: What Is It And How To Do It?  * M1 Finance Prepares Launch Of M1 Spend: 'It's Really A Next Generation Personal Finance Account'(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-04-29	2020-04-29 14:09:23	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	The Main Street Faces of the Fierce Rebound in Stocks	(Bloomberg) -- Back on March 23, it seemed like stocks would never stop falling. Congress was struggling to pass stimulus, coronavirus cases were climbing, futures were pinned to their bottommost tick and $10 trillion in value had vanished.Meanwhile in Northern Virginia, Nicole Kelleher was opening her very first brokerage account. Little did she know, the S&P 500 was about to surge 30%.The romance novel writer and administrative aide at George Mason University spread $5,000 across Peloton Interactive Inc., Fitbit Inc., Trivago and Dropbox Inc., among others, on the Robinhood Financial app. Her husband, a restaurant executive, told her she needed some real estate. So Kelleher bought shares of MFA Financial Inc. Five weeks later, the portfolio is up almost 12%.On their own, Kelleher’s purchases don’t amount to much. But combined with similar decisions by tiny investors around the country, the buying represents a formidable force that has helped the market claw back more than half the ground lost in its fastest bear-market drop. A trio of giant retail brokerages, E*Trade Financial Corp., TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., and Charles Schwab Corp., each saw record sign-ups in the three months ending in March, with much of it coming at the depths of the swoon.“I’m a complete noob when it comes to stocks,” the mother of high school senior twin boys said while sheltering at home. “It’s not thousands and thousands of dollars that I invested, but it’s a start. We’ll see what happens. I hate to say it, but it’s like gambling, isn’t it?”There may be something to that. “When the casinos/sport betting closed down, some of that action went to stock markets,” speculated Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek Research, in a note Wednesday. “Google Trends data supports that idea.”More accounts were opened and dollars invested at E*Trade in the first quarter than in any prior full-year period, according to a company statement. The brokerage added 329,000 retail accounts and over $18 billion in net retail assets.A week after Kelleher’s moves, Tommy McDougall, a retired firefighter, opened an account with E*Trade. He bought two shares of PayPal Holdings Inc. when the stock was trading at $92. It wasn’t much, but it was his first foray into investing. McDougall, a freelance podcast host on topics ranging from fantasy football to hot yoga, spends his days recording in a home studio and taking care of his four kids. Lately he’s been keeping an eye on share prices, too.“When I put money into the market, I did have the theory that we had hit rock bottom,” said McDougall, 37, from his home in Bethpage, New York. “I’ve been checking in and trying to be in tune with the stock market more than I ever have in my life.”Overflowing enthusiasm among mom and pop isn’t universally adored by market pros, given the tenuousness of the rebound. Confidence that President Donald Trump will quickly solve the pandemic crisis may prove unfounded, and as fast as these investors entered the market, they may flee, says Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA.“It’s a question of how they react to the market sell-off,” Gaffney said. “If they don’t have the staying power that some of the institutional investors typically have that are more accustomed to these swings, it can create even more volatility.”Steven Quirk, the executive vice president of trading and education at TD Ameritrade, says that’s an antiquated assumption, though. Historically, the brokerage’s clients have in aggregate bought and sold shares at opportune times, he said. They’re also accessing educational tools in record numbers.Professional investors can debate the staying power of the rally. These believers are betting on unprecedented stimulus combined with curve flattening and re-opening economies, while bears highlight the depth of recession and a slow return to growth. What’s undeniable, though, is that retail’s fingerprints have been all over the rebound, raising questions over whether or not a true capitulation ever happened.At Charles Schwab, clients opened a record 609,000 new brokerage accounts, with almost half of them created in March alone. The firm saw 27 of its 30 most-active trading days ever, including every session in March, Schwab said. Omaha, Nebraska-based TD Ameritrade observed record trading, account openings and net new assets of $45 billion --about 60% of which came from retail clients, as opposed to institutions.“Retail investors -- with more time on their hands -- were watching and stepped in early, which considering the rally we have seen so far appears to be right on time,” Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone, said by phone. “That of course can change as we are still in a tape that is very susceptible to headlines around the virus.”Before the coronavirus shuttered economies and sent stocks reeling, the sight of individual investors embracing the run was a key crux in bull cases across Wall Street. Late last year, multiple brokerages cut trading commissions to zero. That was expected to help the public fall in love with equities again.Even in the midst of the most volatile period on record, it did. Kelleher says part of the attraction of opening a Robinhood account was that there was no fee. McDougall didn’t know if the economy would fall into a recession -- or worse, a depression -- but the E*Trade platform is very user friendly, he said. He got a call from an employee of the brokerage a few days in to make sure he was comfortable using the services.“What’s happening right now is that fear has turned to greed for the retail investor. Nobody wants to be left behind,” said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark. “Have they been part of what has driven the market in the past month? I think so.”Sector-focused equity exchange-traded funds have taken in more than $16 billion in April, the most for any month since 2016, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. So far in 2020, stock ETFs have taken in $60 billion altogether.But even in the wake of increased interest, retail traders aren’t completely letting their guards down. A Charles Schwab survey of 500 active traders found 60% expect the stock market to remain in a bear market through the end of the year. That would mean they believe the rally they’re currently enjoying is likely to fade, demarcating the comeback as a bear market bounce.Kelleher is staying vigilant to that risk. She monitors her portfolio daily and even used videos on YouTube to learn how to create her very own stock-watch list. She regrets not buying Square Inc., and has her eye on United Natural Foods Inc., among others. Still, with the coronavirus not yet contained, she worries.“I would only say that I am being very conservative in the amount that I am investing because of not knowing what is next,” she said. “It’s coming directly from savings, and I just want to make sure we are covered in case everything closes down.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/main-street-faces-fierce-rebound-100000633.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-23	2020-04-23 17:43:43	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Stock Traders Thought This Quarter Would Be Worse Than the First	(Bloomberg) -- How can traders in the equity market be so sanguine when economic tumult on the order of a depression is blaring all around them? Possibly because they expected even worse.That’s one takeaway from data compiled by Charles Schwab Corp. on the brokerage’s most active clients, which shows almost 60% were bracing for volatility to rise in the second quarter. Dread is a natural emotion when things are falling apart, but that’s an awfully pessimistic take considering the first three months of the year saw equity turbulence surpass levels seen in the 2008 financial crisis.“Nobody knows what to expect right now,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.Volatility has subsided in April compared with the back half of the first quarter, when the coronavirus sent stocks to the fastest 30% drawdown on record. The Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX, averaged 49 from Feb. 19 to end of March, after holding near 14 for the first part of the year. It has averaged 44 so far this month.The S&P 500, down 34% at its lows, rose or fell by 1% or more on 30 occasions during the first quarter, almost three times what’s typically seen in the first three months of the year, according to DataTrek Research. The VIX surged to a record in March, and the S&P lost more than 5% on multiple occasions, with March 16 seeing a 12% decline, the worst one-day drop since 1987. It’s now up more than 25% from its March lows.Three in five respondents to the Schwab survey of 500 active traders said they expect the stock market to remain in a bear market for the remainder of the year, and only a quarter of the traders say they’re bullish on U.S. equities.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-traders-thought-quarter-worse-174343203.html?.tsrc=rss

For hours at a time, stocks went nowhere or darted to and fro, causing confusion and frustration.Source: Shutterstock That's going to happen sometimes and traders need to be ready for noncommittal price action in the markets. Head-fakes and sucker's rallies are commonplace. Big stock charts can help us to see the big picture and make sense of seemingly senseless markets.Stocks that move sideways or show choppy price action are sometimes worth watching. If you look for the signs, you might find a stock that's ready to trend in one direction or the other.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Asian Stocks to Buy for a Post-Coronavirus Recovery And so, today we're going to check three big stock charts for Friday that look indecisive but might just be coiled for a serious move in the near future. Let's end the week on a high note and bring out the charts! AT&T (T)Source: Provided by Finviz Some folks consider AT&T (NYSE:T) stock to be a safety investment. It's the type of stock that your father and your grandfather might buy and hold for decades. Thus, it's not always the most volatile stock in the world, and Thursday's price action confirmed this. But maybe the future will bring some excitement for AT&T shareholders.  * Thursday's candlestick for T stock has a small body, indicating that the stock's opening and closing prices are not very far apart. On the other hand, the lower wick and the small body form a hammer candle. That's typically considered a bullish candlestick formation.  * T stock is still for below the 200- and 50-day moving averages. However, the stock has managed to stay above the 20-day moving average. The bulls really need for the price to hold above that moving average.  * Support is at the $26 level. That could be a buy zone if there's a bounce there, but if T stock breaks below it, that would be quite bearish. Broadcom (AVGO)Source: Provided by Finviz Semiconductor standout Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is sometimes volatile, sometimes not. On Thursday AVGO stock chopped up, down, and sideways. Ultimately, there just wasn't much meat on the bone here for momentum or directional traders. Still, this stock has made some sizable moves in the past and you never know what's right around the corner.  * Although AVGO stock barely went anywhere on Thursday, at least the overall trend is still upwards. Still, the bulls will want to see higher prices in order to maintain that trend.  * The megaphone chart pattern has become extremely wide. This suggests broadening price moves in both directions, so caution is definitely advised.  * Momentum traders seeking to ride the uptrend should observe that AVGO still needs to break through the 50- and 200-day moving averages. Plus, there's some resistance at the $320 level. Charles Schwab (SCHW)Source: Provided by Finviz Some banks and brokers are thought of as American institutions. The third of our big stock charts, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), would probably fall into that category. It's an older company that's highly respected, but SCHW stock isn't always a lightning rod in terms of price action.In fact, on Thursday the stock fluctuated within a range, much to the chagrin of action-seeking traders. Nevertheless, it's a perfectly tradable stock that could have strong profit potential for nimble market participants.  * There wasn't a whole lot of action in SCHW stock on Thursday. The market is evidently still deciding whether the $35 level is going to provide support or resistance.  * SCHW stock is sitting right on the 20-day moving average. Hopefully for the bulls, the stock won't break below that important line.  * Volume has been dwindling, so that's another sign that the market hasn't made a firm decision on this stock yet. It's perfectly okay to sit on the sidelines and wait until the market is more decisive.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Almost two hours later, Robinhood Markets Inc. said the problem had been identified and its staff was working on a fix. By 4 p.m. in New York, access had not been restored.Clients blasted the closely held company on social media and several said they would close their accounts. “One of the most anticipated trading days and your service is down at market open,” one user wrote. Another user said: “What is going on -- I can’t do any trades -- you will lose me as customer going forward. This is ridiculous.”The failure was a setback for a Silicon Valley startup that has sought to lure young, tech-savvy investors who want to trade entirely online. Founded in 2013, the Menlo Park, California company made a name for itself by offering commission-free trading on a mobile app. Since then, it has garnered millions of customers and a valuation of $7.6 billion.Financial technology companies may have difficulty dealing with higher trading volume in more volatile markets, said Craig Pirrong, professor of finance at the University of Houston. “Particularly, is the technology scalable enough to handle the amount of orders they’re getting?” he said.Recently, much larger competitors including Charles Schwab Corp. and Fidelity Investments have dropped some trading fees, essentially matching Robinhood’s offering. Companies including Jack Dorsey’s Square Inc. have also started offering the ability to trade stocks for free.U.S. stocks surged the most in 14 months on Monday as investors gained confidence that central banks would intervene to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus.

2020-02-23	2020-02-23 09:30:00	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Ignore 'short-term noise' like coronavirus, Hong Kong protests and focus on US health care stocks, says Charles Schwab	Investors should dismiss &quot;short-term noise&quot; like the anti-government protests that have rocked Hong Kong and the outbreak of coronavirus if they want their portfolio to work for them in the long run, according to Charles Schwab.The American bank and brokerage recommended US health care stocks as the only reliable long-term investment.The civil unrest that has crippled Hong Kong's economy and the current Covid-19 crisis are merely &quot;noise&quot; in the market and investors should not let &quot;knee-jerk reactions&quot; affect their long-term financial planning, said Michael Fong, managing director at Schwab.&quot;We feel that focusing upon long-term is much more important than letting short-term noise impact decisions,&quot; said Fong in an interview in late January. &quot;Take away the noise and actually focus on fundamentals. [Investors should] focus on looking at what they're trying to achieve as a long-term goal.&quot;That, actually, is a very important element of financial planning. In reality, that is [important] when issues like this come up, like the virus or any other issues in the market.&quot;Fong's view is echoed by Ricky Tang, deputy head of multi-asset product, North Asia, at Schroders. He said investors should avoid &quot;knee-jerk reactions&quot; like the sell-off sparked by coronavirus in sectors like consumption, and the rush to buy pharmaceutical companies, seen as benefiting from the outbreak. China floods economy with cash with coronavirus outbreak set to hit economy&quot;These crowding or herding behaviours tend to be short-lived, and ultimately reverse themselves as reality sets in,&quot; said Tang in an email last week. &quot;As such, rather than chasing the crowd and trying to be part of the herd, which could potentially infect your portfolio with poor performance, the wise response to these market volatilities is to focus on long-term outcomes, and ensure your portfolio has some investments which are more resilient to smooth out the volatility.&quot;Health care in the US is the &quot;only sector&quot; that &quot;really has some potential&quot;, said Peter Yiu, associate director and private client adviser at Charles Schwab. &quot;We're all getting older and more and more people are getting older. So in the long run, health care should be a sector that will benefit from that trend.&quot;Stocks in the sector include drug maker Pfizer, medical device company Medtronic, and Johnson& Johnson, which produces medical devices, pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods.In an interview in late January, Yiu said the recommendation is despite health care being &quot;one of the worst sectors on a relative basis&quot; last year in terms of share price, even though it still &quot;went up about 18 per cent&quot;. In contrast, the technology sector surged &quot;48 per cent on average&quot; last year, he said. Hong Kong home prices no longer among world's fastest-growing: Hurun&quot;It will be pretty difficult to repeat that kind of performance again this year,&quot; added Yiu, referring to the tech sector's growth. &quot;We like technology in the long run. But from a diversification perspective, it might be the time when you balance your portfolio.&quot;[For] growth or large cap stocks, they do not always lead. A lot of times, they take rotations in terms of the leadership.&quot;This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

2020-02-20	2020-02-20 21:36:04	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	E*Trade Deal Highlights Tech-Driven Change Felt in Many Markets	(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley’s $13 billion deal to acquire E*Trade Financial Corp. is driven in part by the bank’s need to meet equity investors’ demands for the latest technology and digital trading tools -- and the same forces are reshaping the fixed-income market.A report released Thursday by Greenwich Associates found an appetite for “new and better digital products and tools” among fixed-income investors is fueling competition at banks. Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and technology research at Greenwich, said the elimination of trading commissions by many firms including Charles Schwab Corp. has freed investors to choose a brokerage based on services alone.“A lot of it is based on the tools you provide to the end-user, and I’m not sure the institutional market is much different any more,” he said in an interview. “Compute power is effectively limitless at this point.”In earlier research, Greenwich asked investors how they choose a top-tier bank, and 18% of respondents said technology services like execution algorithms and analytics were a factor. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, machine learning and the ability to mine huge pools of data have radically changed investing, McPartland said.The E*Trade deal, announced Thursday, helps Morgan Stanley add clients who are less wealthy than its traditional customers, but a state-of-the-art platform for investors was another draw. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman cited E*Trade’s “innovation in technology” as a reason for the acquisition, according to a statement.&#92;--With assistance from Sridhar Natarajan.To contact the reporter on this story: Matthew Leising in Los Angeles at mleising@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

2020-01-25	2020-01-25 12:00:00	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	World About to Learn If $1 Trillion Tech Rally Was a Good Idea	(Bloomberg) -- Companies in the Nasdaq 100 are headed into earnings season with momentum that approaches the unprecedented, their value up by more than $1 trillion since October.Now the world finds out if the rally made any sense.Twenty-six constituents are due to report quarterly results next week, including three of the four biggest U.S. companies, over one blistering 48-hour stretch starting Tuesday. With trillion-dollar-plus market capitalizations and a doubling in Apple Inc. since 2018 to account for, it’s possible investors will be in a less-forgiving mood than usual.As things stand now, Nasdaq stocks are perched at the highest forward valuation since 2007 and investors are getting progressively less patient with failure. Already this reporting season, companies in the broader market whose sales and earnings trailed analyst estimates have seen their shares pummeled the next day by the most in five quarters.“The market isn’t going parabolic, but some of these tech stocks really have,” said Randy Frederick, a vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. “If you miss the bar, you’re going to get punished, no question about that.”A four-day week before the landing of big tech earnings saw the Nasdaq 100 slip 0.4% as stocks wavered amid concern over the spread of a virus that started in China. Seven straight weeks of gains have pushed the index to 23 times its forecast earnings, about 30% higher than its 10-year average. That valuations are stretched doesn’t mean stocks can’t rally further. It does raise the drama headed into earnings season.The latest leg of the bull market has come at a time when overall earnings have stopped rising for most industries -- the reason valuations have swelled so much. While the index rose every quarter of 2019 in terms of price, profits fell in two and are now forecast to contract in a third. Given the Nasdaq surged 38%, investors have obviously been OK looking past those numbers. But any indication that 2020’s expectations are optimistic may be taken poorly by stock bulls.That dynamic is writ large in the tech industry, where earnings have dropped 3% or more in each of the past three quarters. Computer and software makers are expected to post a 0.8% profit contraction in the three months through December. Early returns have been encouraging. Texas Instruments, a bellwether for chip stocks, posted results that topped estimates. Intel Corp. reported sales guidance that came in above industry trends.Despite the recent quarterly hiccups, combined net income of five largest tech companies -- Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Facebook -- totaled $40 billion in the third quarter, 38% above the same period two years ago.“Multiples have expanded, but quarter-over-quarter these companies continue to grow earnings and that’s the whole key,” said Gary Bradshaw, a Texas-based portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, who owns shares of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. “It’s one of the areas in the marketplace where you’re seeing good growth. This isn’t 1999 or 2000 when you were valuating those tech stocks on eyeballs.”The cost of falling short has risen as well. A broader gauge of tech, online retail and Internet services stocks dropped 0.9% the day after reporting a miss on second-quarter sales and earnings per share, data compiled by Credit Suisse show. In the third quarter, the average slump was 6.8%.Apple will release quarterly figures on Tuesday, and analysts are focused on how the firm fared during the holiday season and dealt with uncertainty around tariffs. Microsoft, up 62% since the start of 2019, reports Wednesday. Investors will see whether the demand for its cloud-computing programs remains strong. Facebook, which has rallied 66% over that stretch, reports the same day.“I’d expect a little more leadership out of value-oriented sectors, more economically sensitive parts of the market,” Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Schwab Center for Financial Research, said by phone. “I think investors seem to be comfortable with sticking with the leaders that got them here, at least for the time being,”&#92;--With assistance from Wendy Soong.To contact the reporters on this story: Elena Popina in Hong Kong at epopina@bloomberg.net;Sarah Ponczek in New York at sponczek2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brad Olesen at bolesen3@bloomberg.net, Chris Nagi, Richard RichtmyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-learn-1-trillion-tech-120000327.html?.tsrc=rss

Another day of quiet trading means major market indices are basically flat over the past three sessions.Source: Shutterstock The lack of movement makes some sense. A hugely important batch of earnings reports loom next week, with four of the five most valuable U.S.-listed companies -- Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) -- releasing earnings. The impeachment trial is dominating the headlines. And there are some signs of weakness in broader macroeconomic performance.  * Invest in America's Most Trusted Brands With These 7 Stocks to Buy Of course, those factors also suggest that some sort of movement is coming, particularly given that the last two earnings season peaks led a July sell-off and catalyzed an October rally. Friday's big stock charts feature three names that on their own seem set to make a move, each of which could be amplified by broader sentiment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips General Motors (GM)Source: Provided by Finviz On a forward price-to-earnings basis, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is the fourth-cheapest stock in the S&P 500. But low valuation alone has done little for GM stock, which has remained stuck for years.That may not change for some time -- if ever. But the first of Friday's big stock charts does at least suggest some near-term optimism ahead of earnings early next month:  * GM stock sits near the support line of a narrowing descending wedge, which often is a reversal pattern. The wedge does have a sideways lean, and likely still is too wide, but it's worth noting that support for the last few years generally has held not far below current levels. A &quot;hammer chart&quot; pattern on Thursday helps the bull case as well. The chart isn't perfect, but there is some evidence to suggest another reversal from levels under $35.  * Fundamentally, again, the valuation seems ridiculously attractive. GM stock trades at 5.5x forward earnings. Its dividend yields 4.4%. There are worries, among them &quot;peak auto&quot; and the rise of self-driving cars and electric vehicles from the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). But even those worries would seem to be priced in to at least some extent.  *   Click to Enlarge Source: Provided by Finviz But the core problem here is that the same bull case has held for years now and GM stock has gone nowhere. It generally has outperformed rival Ford (NYSE:F), but that's a low bar to clear. General Motors still has a lot of work to do to change sentiment to the point where it can have a bull case that goes beyond &quot;its stock is too cheap.&quot; But it's possible, if not likely, that the stock might be at least a little too cheap from a near-term perspective. Charles Schwab (SCHW)Source: Provided by Finviz Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) isn't as cheap as GM. Its long-term performance hasn't been quite as stagnant, but there are some similarities between the stories. The second of Friday's stock charts also suggests potential near-term bullishness:  * SCHW has established a flag pattern. A big jump in November after the company announced its plan to acquire online brokerage rival TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) creates the 'flagpole,' while sideways trading since represents the 'flag.' Flag patterns usually are continuation patterns, which suggest another leg up. And while an ascending narrowing wedge does raise the risk of a reversal, the 50-day moving average has provided support, while a golden cross from early December hasn't yet led to a rally. Here, too, the chart isn't perfect, but it does lean positive.  * Schwab stock isn't as cheap as GM, but at 19x 2020 earnings per share estimates is hardly expensive. Multiples pro forma for the TD Ameritrade deal are even lower. But there are fundamental worries facing a well-known U.S. consumer brand. Commissions in the industry are going to zero. Lower interest rates have pressured income from cash held in customer accounts. And SCHW stock has struggled over a broader period: shares actually are down 12% over the past two years.  * As with GM, while the near-term chart looks positive, secular risks explain a seemingly attractive valuation. For both stocks, market sentiment would help. That could either be a continued rally -- or, perhaps, a long-awaited shift in investor demand from growth names to value plays. LyondellBasell (LYB)Source: Provided by Finviz LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) is another value play that has struggled to drive shareholder value. But the third of our big stock charts looks much more concerning:  * LYB stock simply looks like it's rolling over. $90 clearly has been established as a key level, providing resistance last year and support more recently. Shares now have breached that support while also reversing out of both an ascending narrowing wedge and a descending triangle. The one piece of good news is a hammer chart pattern on Thursday, in which shares held just below the 200-day moving average. But LYB seems to be hanging on by a thread at the moment.  * The trading looks particularly worrisome given that LyondellBasell reports fourth quarter earnings next week. The lack of confidence implied by recent trading doesn't necessarily bode well. It's possible a lower price will mean lower expectations. But it's just as likely that the breakdown in LYB suggests that some investors are predicting a weak report -- and others won't be swayed by even a better-than-expected quarter.  * Bulls would respond that LyondellBasell stock is cheap. At less than 9x 2019 earnings per share, it is. An attractive dividend yield makes the stock an income favorite; as with other widely-held names, it's possible that yield could provide support around $84 (at which point the yield would clear 5%). But LYB stock has been cheap for years, and other chemical giants like Dow (NYSE:DOW) and DuPont (NYSE:DD) look inexpensive on paper as well. &quot;Too cheap&quot; hasn't been enough for LYB stock for most of the past decade, and it doesn't look like it's enough yet, either.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2020-01-19	2020-01-19 13:00:43	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Brexit, Facebook, Endowments and Other Errors	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Every year for the past decade I have been making a list of what I got wrong. This act of contrition allows me to own my mistakes, recognize my fallibility and learn from the experience. I hope you find some value in doing the same exercise.Let’s get to the errors:No. 1. Trading commissions: Last February, I cited a Morningstar survey that found that “fees fell 8 percent in 2017, the largest one-year decline ever reported.” It seemed, according to data on fees, that the point of diminishing returns had been reached. “The race to zero may be reaching its natural limits,” I wrote.Boy, did Charles Schwab Corp. prove me wrong.Although commission-free trading has been around awhile, it was either a niche product or offered as a teaser for other products. After investment giant Schwab said in October that it would offer commission-free trading, everyone from Fidelity to Vanguard to TD Ameritrade followed suit.One caveat: There is no free lunch, and free trading means that offsetting fees may be hidden or buried in the fine print. I continue to believe that, at least in finance, cheap is better than free. No. 2. University endowments underperform: Each October, many college endowments release their investment performance data for the past fiscal year. I wrote about the Ivy League endowments and how they had failed to beat benchmark returns.But I made an assumption that the benchmark these endowments were being compared against was a globally diversified portfolio. I was wrong. As it turns out — buried in a footnote of the research I relied on — the benchmark used for the study was a domestic portfolio.  This is not a good comparison because the endowments invest globally. It stands to reason that they would look like laggards in a period of U.S. market outperformance versus the rest of the world. The lesson learned: The footnotes matter — a lot.No. 3. Brexit: I have been saying that the British will eventually come to realize that Brexit is a self-destructive and needless exercise and eventually would reverse the referendum mandating that the U.K. leave the European Union. I said it here, here and here.The election as prime minister of Boris Johnson, an opportunistic Brexiteer, pretty much means that the exit is going to be fast-tracked in a way that his predecessor, Theresa May, could never manage. There is no need to wait for it to be official: I was wrong about Brexit. The only argument left is whether the U.K. will leave the EU with or without a deal setting the terms of the departure.No. 4. Fiduciary rule: I have long argued that the brokerage industry owes consumers a higher level of care than now on offer and that putting client interests first should be the standard. In other words, rules should require brokers to serve as fiduciaries rather than as the glorified used-car salesmen that they historically have been.Despite opposition from the brokerage industry to any rule change, investors have been voting with their dollars and hiring financial advisers that conform to this better standard. It is all but inevitable, I wrote, that this fiduciary standard would be adopted by the industry, albeit with a nudge from the government.But I underestimated what the deeply motivated and deep-pocketed brokerage industry can accomplish in a deeply corrupt Washington. For now, rules requiring the adoption of the fiduciary standard are on hold.No. 5. Facebook didn't flip the 2016 election: I made a mistake on the long-running debate about the role of a weaponized Facebook in the 2016 election, arguing that very few people change their minds based on social media. Mostly, I argued, social media is a giant echo chamber and that people aggressively avoid ideas that challenge their established opinions.Given how close the 2016 election was — decided by a tiny share of the votes cast in three or four states — I am willing to admit that maybe Facebook content did persuade a few people to change their votes or stay home. Theoretically, this could have swung the election. And while I was predisposed to discount the role of social media in 2020, I now believe it could matter a lot. Let’s hope the 2020 election isn’t so close that the role of social media even matters.To contact the author of this story: Barry Ritholtz at britholtz3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Barry Ritholtz is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-01-16	2020-01-16 21:12:01	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Charles Schwab’s Zero-Fee Plan Pushes Assets to Record $4 Trillion	(Bloomberg) -- Charles Schwab Corp.’s plan to eliminate trading fees pushed client assets to a record, surpassing $4 trillion and sending shares higher, even as the firm faced a decline in trading revenue.Customers opened 433,000 new brokerage accounts in fourth quarter, bringing the total to 12.3 million, according to a statement issued Thursday. Trading revenue plunged 58% to $86 million in the period after the company introduced zero-commission trades.The results are the first view of how the largest discount broker’s fee change, which was followed by rivals, is impacting Schwab’s bottom line. And it comes after the company’s $26 billion agreement to buy rival TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.The shares rose more than 4% to $49 in New York trading, the biggest gain since Nov. 21 when news of the Ameritrade deal first broke.Schwab incurred $17 million in pretax acquisition-related expenses in the quarter, which weighed on profit. Schwab reported earnings of 62 cents per share, compared with the average estimate of 64 cents.While earnings missed estimates, the growth in assets, new accounts and client cash pointed in a positive direction, said to Devin Ryan, an analyst with JMP Securities.“There’s reason for optimism on the underlying outlook for the business,” Ryan said in an interview.Other highlightsFourth quarter net interest revenue -- the money Schwab makes from client cash and the largest source of profits -- fell about 2%Total quarterly revenue declined to $2.6 billionSchwab plans a business update conference call with investors on Feb. 4 at 11:30 a.m. New York time.Read moreSchwab Triggers Online-Broker Bloodbath as Price War DeepensBrokers Profit From You Even If They Don’t Charge for TradingSchwab to Acquire TD Ameritrade in Reshaping of Industry (1)(Adds account graphic and shares after third paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: John Gittelsohn in Los Angeles at johngitt@bloomberg.net;Annie Massa in New York at amassa12@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sam Mamudi at smamudi@bloomberg.net, Alan Mirabella, Melissa KarshFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-zero-fee-plan-140740845.html?.tsrc=rss

Net income fell to $852 million, or 62 cents a share, from $935 million, or 65 cents a share, in the year-ago period. The results include an expense related to pending acquisitions of 1 cent per share. The FactSet consensus for earnings per share was 64 cents. Revenue fell 2% to $2.61 billion, matching the FactSet consensus, as net interest revenue declined 1.9% to $1.60 billion. Asset management and administration fees revenue rose 12% to $845 million, just shy of the FactSet consensus of $846 million, while trading revenue dropped 58% to $86 million but beat expectations of $78 million. Schwab caused a stir in the discount broker industry during the fourth quarter, when it dropped commissions on U.S. stocks, ETF and options, then announced a deal to buy rival TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.  in a $26 billion deal. Schwab's stock has soared 20.8% over the past three months through Wednesday, while the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF  has gained 9.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has advanced 7.5%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b8beaa32-586e-3d2e-8005-9478c5ddcc75/charles-schwab%26%2339%3Bs-stock.html?.tsrc=rss

Between the 2008-09 financial crisis and the increased scrutiny of investment management conflicts of interest, the balance of power in the retail channel has shifted more heavily toward the distributors.  This has led to not only increased fee compression, with investors (put off by the poor relative performance of actively managed funds) increasingly seeking lower-cost index-based options, but also product rationalization on the major retail distribution platforms, with broker/dealer and advisory networks culling funds with poor performance records, high expense ratios and/or low inclusion rates.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/717c154a-8eeb-3cec-9c8b-405ef08dbec5/4-traits-asset-managers-need.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-03	2020-01-03 11:30:37	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	The Death of Brokerage Fees Was 50 Years in the Making	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It looks as if 2019 will be remembered as the year when stock brokerage fees, having declined for years, finally disappeared altogether. Led by the free stock-trading startup Robinhood Markets Inc., a host of big names have eliminated fees: E*Trade Financial Corp., Charles Schwab Corp., TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. and many others.Although it’s tempting to credit this development to online platforms, this is a revolution 50 years in the making. In the late 1960s, some iconoclastic reformers started a campaign to kill off fixed brokerage fees. Today, we’re witnessing the logical culmination of that effort.It’s hard to imagine now, but for most of Wall Street’s history, the New York Stock Exchange required member brokers to charge customers a minimum commission rate, typically a percentage of the par value of the shares traded. This was a function of the NYSE’s identity as a quasi-cartel that ensured all member brokers a share of the commission pie, shielding them from the ruinous effects of no-holds-barred competition.That one of the primary engines of American capitalism once engaged in deeply anti-competitive behavior may seem strange, but for the architects of the NYSE, this was a sacred creed. In 1894, the NYSE’s Governing Committee called the minimum commission rule “the fundamental principle of the Exchange … on its strict adherence hangs the financial welfare and the life of the Institution itself.”This sentiment prevailed well into the 20th century, surviving the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 1930s. In fact, New Deal reformers didn’t want to touch minimum commissions, fearing that their removal would spark dangerous speculation in the stock market.By the 1960s, though, the brokerage fee structure had come under strain. The key was the rise of institutional investors. Big players like insurance companies and pension funds accounted for only a fifth of total trading volume in 1950; a decade later they accounted for a solid majority.Stock brokers welcomed them. After all, they got a far larger commission with the buying and selling of large blocks of shares, even though it wasn’t really any more work. But these large commissions had the inadvertent effect of undermining the minimum-fee structure: Brokers were so desperate to land big customers that they began bending the rules.How they did so was a testament to the brokers’ ingenuity. The NYSE brokers couldn’t abandon the fixed-rate structure, so they negotiated what was known as a “customer-directed give up.” A big institutional investor would buy (or sell) a large block of shares and pay the broker the standard fee. But the customer would then direct the broker to “give up” upward of 70% of the fee, redirecting it to other brokers who had done other work for the client: equity research, for example.This was price competition camouflaged via an elaborate network of rebates and redistributions — and it worked, if imperfectly. As the Wall Street Journal observed, “There was so much fat in the commission on large orders that brokers were willing to negotiate the size of their fee with the large customers, then give away the rest.” Of course, the same privilege wasn’t extended to individual investors; they had to pay full freight.The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division knew what was happening, and as early as 1967, it urged the NYSE to abandon its attachment to fixed commissions. The NYSE fought back. Robert Haack, its newly appointed president, warned Congress that negotiated rates might lead to the “undoing of the world’s principal securities market.” But the government would not be moved, with the Securities and Exchange Commission likewise recommending reform.What changed things, though, was the conversion of none other than Haack himself. In what the New York Times would describe as “perhaps the most controversial speech ever given by a Big Board president,” Haack in late 1970 got up in front of a dinner attended by the governors of the NYSE and other Wall Street players. The attendees expected a conventional boring speech. Instead, as historians Janice Traflet and Michael Coyne have chronicled, the listeners received a tongue-lashing.Haack blasted the fixed-rate rule, blaming it for what he described as “indiscreet excesses” and “inept management” at brokerage firms battening on excessive fees. He counseled the NYSE to abandon “archaic and anachronistic practices and procedures,” and bluntly told his listeners that the “vestiges of a private-club atmosphere which remain at the New York Stock Exchange must be discarded.”This speech aroused intense indignation, with many calling for his removal. But Haack didn’t back down: The fixed-commission system was driving a growing number of investors into third-party contracts outside the purview of the NYSE. If this continued, the Big Board might become irrelevant.Haack wasn’t alone. Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers issued calls for reform, recognizing that they could readily compete — and profit — in a world of competitive bidding. Others, like newly created discount broker Charles Schwab, also pushed for deregulation, seeing an opportunity to grab business from firms ill-prepared to fend for themselves.The SEC forced reform on the NYSE in several steps. The first was an order that brokers making transactions of half a million dollars or more had to submit to negotiated rates, but only on the amount above that critical threshold. This led to additional changes. In 1973, the SEC demanded that the NYSE abolish fixed rates by May 1, 1975; Congress followed suit, writing this date into an amendment of the Securities Act.Robert Baldwin, the head of Morgan Stanley, dubbed the deadline “Mayday,” after the common code for distress. But May 1 came and went, and the world did not end. A year later, 11 underperforming brokerage houses had merged with competitors; nine more failed altogether. But this was a far cry from Baldwin’s prediction that up to 200 investment banks would go under.The benefits of competitive pricing, though, overwhelmingly went to the biggest institutional investors, with brokerage fees declining as much as 50 percent. Wealthy investors also managed to secure cut-rate commissions. Small investors initially saw their rates go up, largely because the big brokerage houses had no interest in dickering over fees for a tiny trade.But as fees rose for ordinary investors, this opened the door to yet another revolution: the proliferation of bare-bones discount brokers operating along the lines of Schwab. A decade after Mayday, the Wall Street Journal counted more than 600 discount operations luring away investors from conventional stock brokerages. This in turn helped fuel a democratization in stock market participation. As trading costs fell, more investors dabbled in the market, fueling yet more competition for their business.The advent of computerized trading platforms drove the decline in fees as well, but in reality, the key steps had been taken many years earlier, when the NYSE finally unleashed capitalist forces on their own brokers. Indeed, one researcher who has researched commission costs has tracked a long steady decline that dates back to 1975.And now we’re finally at zero: Trading is free. The revolution started by government regulators and Robert Haack has reached its inescapable conclusion.To contact the author of this story: Stephen Mihm at smihm1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Stacey Shick at sshick@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Stephen Mihm, an associate professor of history at the University of Georgia, is a contributor to Bloomberg Opinion.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/death-brokerage-fees-50-years-113037121.html?.tsrc=rss

And Robinhood sparked a movement toward free stock trading that has shaken the business models of the likes of Charles Schwab Corp. and E*Trade Financial Corp.Still, analysts and experts say there’s more to come. Sweeping mergers and acquisitions have transformed some of the industry’s largest incumbents in payments, who are gearing up for a bigger fight for market share with newcomers. And regulators are looking to have more say over how technology companies venture into financial services.Here’s our annual list of the most important trends, challenges and companies to watch in the New Year.Exit StrategiesMergers and acquisitions have historically been small and rare in the fintech space, but that changed in a big way in 2019. Fiserv Inc., Fidelity National Information Services Inc. and Global Payments Inc. did a series of deals that transformed payment processing in the U.S. More recently, PayPal Holdings Inc. made its largest acquisition ever and Charles Schwab announced it would buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for about $26 billion. That frenzied pace of deal-making might continue through (at least some of) 2020.Lindsay Davis, senior intelligence analyst, CB Insights: “Wealth management will likely see more consolidation from incumbents, who are under pressure to compete for next-gen customers and an army of virally growing fintech apps who have abstracted the client relationship away from the old guard. Charles Schwab buying TD Ameritrade is just the beginning of more strategic consolidation to come.”Matt Harris, partner, Bain Capital Ventures: “I think there is a window during the first half of the year for IPOs, but once summer hits people will be fundamentally distracted by the election. I certainly don’t think it will be fast and furious.”Regulatory ScrutinyMemorably, in 2019 Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook Inc.’s plan to overhaul the world banking system in front of Congress. (Legislators were not amused.) Our experts think there’s plenty more government scrutiny ahead for financial technology players. That’s even though regulators including the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have sought to encourage banks to work with newer technologies like alternative data in their underwriting in an attempt to bring more people into the financial services ecosystem. Companies will need to adjust their strategies accordingly.Alyson Clarke, principal analyst, Forrester: “Regulators are going to start taking a closer look and scrutinizing artificial intelligence. The whole Apple Card and the supposed gender bias -- I think we’ll see more things like this surface. Transparency in AI is critical and ethics in AI is critical and it needs regulatory oversight.”Vanessa Colella, Chief Innovation Officer, Citigroup Inc.: “We want to make sure the people who are transacting are who they say they are. As we get to 40 billion devices online, you can see it’s not just about KYC, or Know Your Customer, it’s KYM, or Know Your Machine -- and being sure that, as these transactions are happening at the edge, that you’re able to validate what the machine is, and whether the machine has the permission and the capability to make that transaction.”The Rise of Digital BanksChime, the leading U.S. digital bank, is now valued at $5.8 billion. That makes it more valuable than some of the country’s largest banks, including New York Community Bancorp, CIT Group Inc. or Synovus Financial Corp. It’s part of a new class of entrants, known as “challenger banks” or “neo-banks,” that’s raised more than $3 billion in venture funding in the first three quarters of this year. With that has come millions of customers. Will they remain loyal? Or will traditional lenders be able to win them back?Frank Rotman, founding partner, QED Investors: “While these neo-banks can’t yet match the complete suite of banking products that a traditional branch-based bank can, this doesn’t matter to the typical consumer because they rarely, if ever, use any of the hundreds of products that are in a bank’s arsenal. So we’ll be talking about challenger banks in 2020 and in 2021 and in 2022 and eventually the ‘challenger’ title will be dropped because they’ll be major players in the ecosystem.”Mitch Siegel, principal, KPMG: “I do believe 2020 is an arms race: You’re going to see a lot of people launching digital banking initiatives. Personalization is what’s changed that game. Cross-selling without personalization seems sleazy but if you can personalize offers, and give me things that are high probability that I actually want them, I’m OK with you trying to sell me other products and services. Make it easy. Know me. Value me. Protect me.”The Bank of Apple? Big Tech Moves InIf you’ve read this annual post before, you’ll be no stranger to predictions that the technology giants of the world will move deeper in to finance. The pace of those moves accelerated this year, however, with Apple launching a credit card with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Alphabet Inc. announcing a checking product with Citigroup, and Facebook attempting to make a new global currency.Matt Harris: “I think this is inevitable. Tech companies, large and small, will be looking to incorporate payments, lending and insurance in their business models in the coming years, and the smartest and most capable banks will want to be part of that movement. I do think this raises the stakes for pure fintech startups.”Frank Rotman: “The trend is broader than ‘tech getting into finance.’ It should be seen as ‘customer-facing organizations’ offering their customers banking products. Many customer-facing organizations have built up trust with their customers -- as evidenced by high engagement and high net promoter scores -- but don’t want to, nor see the need for, officially becoming a bank. Instead, they can partner with banks that are willing to co-brand or white label their services and offer great banking products to their loyal customers.”Lindsay Davis: “Netflix could also leverage financial services to compete and enable gig-economy workers and freelancers in the film and TV industry, which have been traditionally too niche to serve, and have a unique set of pain points.”To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.net;Jenny Surane in New York at jsurane4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

2019-12-12	2019-12-12 15:30:00	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Tech Makes Life on the Coasts Tough for Banks	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Why is the nation's financial industry concentrated in just a few very costly cities?The latest actions by the Charles Schwab Corp. suggest there's less reason than there once was amid the squeeze the industry has been feeling since the Great Recession ended. In Schwab's case -- amid slow economic growth, low interest rates and continued pressure on trading commissions -- the discount brokerage firm slashed its fees, said it would buy a main rival and move its headquarters from high-cost San Francisco to more-affordable Dallas. It may not be the last to make such a move.No matter what part of the financial services or banking ecosystems you look at, revenues are harder to come by today than they were 10 or 20 years ago. Trading commissions have fallen, with online brokerages ushering in zero commissions. Bid-ask spreads for market makers have narrowed. Management fees for mutual funds and hedge funds continue to shrink. Mutual funds are losing market share to low-cost exchange-traded funds. Net interest margins for banks have been compressed by both low interest rates and a flatter yield curve. The Volcker rule restricted some of the more lucrative activities banks can do. Higher capital requirements have reduced the profitability of the banks. Loan growth has been anemic since the financial crisis. And increasingly, private companies are looking to do direct listings on stock markets rather than initial public offerings, threatening bank underwriting fees.And at the same time that revenues have been pressured, the costs of operating in coastal urban hubs where the finance industry has traditionally been clustered continue to rise. Although conservatives might snicker and chalk it up to the higher taxes in coastal finance centers, the bigger story has been the concentration of the technology industry and the young, highly paid knowledge workers they hire. In the first decade of the 2000s, when the credit and housing booms were roaring, the tech industry played second fiddle to finance when it came to urban employment. Even San Francisco was relatively tech-free until Twitter set up shop in the latter half of the decade. Rents, although high, were manageable for many workers with good financial industry jobs.That's no longer the case. With tech on a tear, young college-educated workers have, in turn, clustered in a handful of cities to gain access to more job opportunities. This dynamic has driven up rents in New York and San Francisco, posing stiff competition for financial companies looking to hire workers with the same types of skills prized by tech firms. The mediocre post-recession environment in finance has also meant banking and investment firms often find themselves outbid for talent.For the financial industry, that means if you can't beat 'em, retreat to cheaper pastures. That helps explain why Goldman Sachs has expanded in Salt Lake City; AllianceBernstein is planning to move its headquarters from New York to Nashville, Tennessee; and BlackRock is opening an &quot;innovation center&quot; in Atlanta. Perhaps the most significant announcement was made by JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon in October, when he said that he expects Texas to eventually overtake New York as the state with more of the bank's employees than any other.As with the shifts in the manufacturing industry, these changes take place over years and decades, but it's likely that the trend of decentralization will continue. Although Schwab is a high-profile financial firm moving its headquarters out of San Francisco, a much bigger one -- Wells Fargo -- remains based there. But for how long? The scandal-plagued bank recently hired a new chief executive, but he plans to remain in New York rather than move to the West Coast. The bank has five times as many job postings on its website in Charlotte, North Carolina, thanks to its acquisition of Wachovia, as it does in San Francisco. It wouldn't be a surprise if -- as part of its long-term repositioning strategy -- a headquarters relocation is part of the mix.It's been a bit more than a decade since the financial crisis, and banks and financial-services firms have had enough time to dust themselves off and adjust to the new environment for the industry. If the 2000s were defined by the bust, and the 2010s were a period of recovery and sluggish growth, then maybe the 2020s will be when the industry consolidates and finally lowers costs by shifting to cheaper cities.To contact the author of this story: Conor Sen at csen9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Conor Sen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2019-12-11	2019-12-11 22:20:10	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Brazil Broker XP Surges in Debut After $1.96 Billion IPO	(Bloomberg) -- XP Inc., Brazil’s largest brokerage by equity-trading volume, rose 28% in its trading debut after its initial public offering topped expectations to raise $1.96 billion.Shares of XP, Brazil’s answer to Charles Schwab Corp., opened at $32.75 each in New York trading Wednesday after pricing at $27 Tuesday. The company had marketed the shares for $22 to $25.The shares closed at $34.46 in New York trading, giving the company a market value of $19 billion. That makes XP more valuable than Banco BTG Pactual SA, Brazil’s biggest standalone investment bank, which is worth $15.7 billion.The company and its existing shareholders sold 72.5 million shares Tuesday. XP also granted its underwriters the option of selling an additional 10.88 million so-called greenshoe shares, according to a statement.XP is poised to fully exercise that overallotment option, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because that information wasn’t public. That would bring the amount raised in the IPO to about $2.25 billion.The listing is the biggest by a Brazilian firm since finance company Pagseguro Digital Ltd.’s $2.6 billion offering on the New York Stock Exchange in January 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.$1 Billion ClubThe IPO is the fourth-biggest in the U.S. this year, after listings by Uber Technologies Inc., Avantor Inc. and Lyft Inc. It’s one of nine exceeding $1 billion, four of which -- including Uber and Lyft -- are now trading below their offer prices.XP, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. acting as the stabilization agent, has experienced a smoother trading debut than other listings. SmileDirectClub Inc. fell more than 27% on its first day of trading after its $1.35 billion IPO in September.The offering was also led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, XP Investments and Itau BBA. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol XP.XP is based in Sao Paulo and incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Its existing investors XP Controle, General Atlantic (XP) Bermuda and DYNA III Fundo de Investimento em Participacoes were among sellers, according to its filings. Itau Unibanco Holding SA isn’t divesting any of its 49.9% stake, according to the filings.Expansion, AcquisitionsXP plans to use the proceeds to finance growth, make acquisitions and enter new businesses such as digital banking, payments and insurance. It took over the No. 1 spot for Brazil equity trading this year, surpassing UBS Group AG’s local broker-dealer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The broker received a banking license last year and plans to become a full-service lender.“We’d be interested in business that have synergy with ours, but Brazil’s regulators prevent us from buying other brokers,” founder and Chief Executive Officer Guilherme Benchimol told reporters Wednesday. He said there were no ongoing talks for acquisitions currently.Benchimol said the company is focused on Brazil, where “banking concentration is still brutal, presenting a big opportunity.” XP’s principal new initiative is creating a bank, which will allow it to launch new products that capture a bigger share of clients’ investments, he said.Brazilian ShareHe added that he would have liked the company to be listed in Brazil, but couldn’t because of regulations that include restrictions on the dual class structure of its Nasdaq offering. Holders of Class B stock will get 10 votes a share while the Class A shares will come with one vote apiece.XP said it allowed Brazilian funds to have a bigger share of the IPO than usual, he said.Inspired by Charles Schwab, the biggest U.S. discount brokerage, XP has been at the forefront of changing the way Brazilians invest by offering middle-class investors products that were once only available to the rich, while luring money away from the nation’s biggest banks at a breakneck pace.For the nine months ended Sept. 30, XP earned 699 million reais ($169 million) on revenue of 3.7 billion reais, according to its filings.1.5 Million ClientsThe company has more than 1.5 million clients and 350 billion reais in assets under custody as of September, according to its filings. Benchimol has said that he expects the company to have 1 trillion reais under custody by the end of 2020.Benchimol was 24 when he created XP in 2001 with Marcelo Maisonnave.

2019-12-11	2019-12-11 20:15:35	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	XP’s Surge After IPO Gives Its Founder a $1.2 Billion Fortune	(Bloomberg) -- Guilherme Benchimol decided to set up his own firm when he was 24 with only 10,000 reais in his bank account and after being fired from a brokerage firm. Now, at 43, that venture’s success has placed him among Brazil’s richest people.Benchimol’s fortune surged Wednesday to about $1.2 billion after XP Inc.’s initial public offering in New York. Shares of the Sao Paulo-based brokerage he co-founded opened at $32.75 -- above the IPO price of $27 -- and climbed as much as 28%, valuing his stake at roughly $1 billion. He also sold $200 million of shares in the offering, according to Bloomberg calculations based on the prospectus.“We will not rest until we completely transform the Brazilian financial system and improve people’s lives,” Benchimol, the firm’s chief executive officer, wrote in a letter to clients after the IPO. The company is his “life project,” he said.Inspired by Charles Schwab, Sao Paulo-based XP is changing the way Brazilians invest by offering middle-class investors products that were once available only to the rich. XP, Brazil’s largest brokerage by equity-trading volume, is luring money away from the nation’s biggest banks at a breakneck pace.The company had more than 1.5 million clients and 350 billion reais ($85 billion) in assets under custody as of September, filings show. Benchimol said last year that he expects 1 trillion reais under custody by the end of 2020. Brazil’s five biggest banks account for 93% of the 8.6 trillion reais in investment assets under custody in the nation, according to a report by Oliver Wyman.A spokesman for XP declined to comment on Benchimol’s wealth or the ownership arrangement.XP was founded in 2001 by Benchimol and Marcelo Maisonnave, who later left the company. It was named after XPTO, a generic placeholder in Portuguese, somewhat like XYZ in English. After a year, Benchimol had to sell his car and borrow 5,000 reais from his half-brother, Julio Capua, to keep things going, operating only as a stock brokerage.The company was reinvented after the 2008 economic downturn, when Benchimol attended a Charles Schwab Corp. event in San Francisco. That inspired him to follow Schwab’s model by creating “the first real one-stop investment shop” in Brazil, Benchimol said.Benchimol showed up at the Nasdaq on Wednesday wrapped in the Brazilian flag and gave a quick, teary speech, capped by a song associated with his idol Ayrton Senna, a Brazilian racing champion who died in 1994. Benchimol said in an interview with Bloomberg late last year that he admired Senna mostly for his “impossible victories,” something he aimed to emulate at XP.&#92;--With assistance from Vinícius Andrade.To contact the reporters on this story: Felipe Marques in Sao Paulo at fmarques10@bloomberg.net;Tom Maloney in New York at tmaloney38@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

2019-12-11	2019-12-11 19:22:53	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Robinhood Launches Its Cash Management Service, a Year After Botched Launch	(Bloomberg) -- Robinhood Markets Inc. has finally launched its take on a bank account, albeit a very different version of the service it once hoped to offer. On Wednesday, the online brokerage firm rolled out Cash Management to a subset of users. The product will sweep the money customers don’t currently have in stocks into a separate account with 1.8% interest.The introduction comes after a debacle for the company last year, when Robinhood, known for popularizing free stock trading, announced a product called Checking & Savings that drew swift backlash. The startup has spent much of the past 12 months retooling how it would offer cash management services and making sure that this time, it wouldn’t raise any red flags with industry watchdogs or regulators.The product is part of a larger effort at Robinhood to broaden its business model. “Our entire business was built knowing we weren’t going to be charging trading commissions,” said Co-Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev. “We’ll still have existing revenue streams, and in addition we’ll add revenue from interchange on debit card transactions. As we launch even more products covering even more needs of customers, that revenue stream will continue to diversify.”Cash Management will offer bank-like services—including debit cards and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. coverage on deposits— through a partnership with an existing bank, unlike Checking & Savings, which did not have such a partnership. The product represents a scaling back of banking ambitions for the startup, which had originally planned to become a bank itself. But last month, the company withdrew its application for a national banking charter. Being granted such a license would have allowed the company to offer checking accounts, debit cards and similar services on its own. No fintech startup has so far successfully won a charter.The debut of Cash Management comes after several other financial technology startups have rolled out their own banking services, leading to an increasingly crowded field. Betterment LLC and Wealthfront Corp. also have their own versions of cash management services, as do more traditional competitors like Charles Schwab Corp. At the same time, Robinhood’s main business of free stock trading is also seeing more competition. Over the last several months, Charles Schwab, E*Trade Financial Corp. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. all eliminated trading fees for U.S. stocks, exchange traded funds and options.To contact the author of this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-launches-cash-management-botched-192253797.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-10	2019-12-10 19:59:52	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	How a Chat With Chuck Schwab Inspired an S&P 500 Call for 3,950	(Bloomberg) -- In a recent surprise encounter, BTIG’s Julian Emanuel met Charles Schwab. It took just 20 minutes of chatting for the finance legend to spur a bold call from the Wall Street strategist: A 25% gain for stocks in 2020.It’s not his base case, but BTIG’s chief equity and derivatives strategist says it’s possible that the S&P 500 Index surges to 3,950 next year, driven in part by the fee war that’s swept the asset management industry. It was just after Charles Schwab Corp. cut commissions to zero when Emanuel and the brokerage’s founder met.“His enthusiasm over the whole idea that this was another step in the democratization of markets for the public, it was so profound and it really hit me,” Emanuel said in an interview. “To me, his belief in the benefits of markets and investing seem to be stronger than ever. That really focused our attention on the potential.”The logic goes like this. For much of the past decade’s bull market, investors have remained under-invested, preferring the safety of cash over the risk of equities. But history shows that typically near the end of cycles, “the public investor falls in love” with risk assets, often “resulting in a parabolic move higher,” Emanuel wrote to clients this week. To him, zero-fee trading could be the spark that ignites the rush even after the 25% gain so far this year.Charles Schwab said it would cut commissions on trades for stocks, options, and exchange-traded funds to zero in October, sending shares of its competitors spiraling. TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. did too the same day (although Schwab later agreed to buy the broker), and E*Trade Financial Corp. made the move the day after.In the month that followed, clients opened 142,000 new brokerage accounts at Schwab, a 31% jump from the prior period.“If you’re going to have more account openings, those people aren’t buying bond funds,” Emanuel said by phone. “People are starting to pay incrementally more attention. The move to zero fee online trading is one of those things that makes is so incredibly easy.”His discussion with Chuck Schwab reminded Emanuel of rule changes in the past that weren’t expected to have outsize effects on stocks, but did. Take the turn of the century, when a move by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that ordered stock prices be reported in decimals instead of fractions led to higher trading volumes. Or in 2007, when the regulator removed the so-called Uptick Rule, introducing new market dynamics, he said.To Ryan Nauman, a market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence’s Zephyr, the connection makes sense. But a 25% gain from the S&P 500’s current levels seems a bit lofty considering risks including U.S.-China trade war, a presidential election and geopolitical tensions abroad will likely persist.“If there is less cost, trading should pick up and you’d assume trading to the upside,” Nauman said by phone. “That definitely could help drive markets. I’m not quite that optimistic though. There’s just too many headlines out there.”But Kelly Bogdanova, vice president and portfolio analyst for RBC Wealth Management’s Portfolio Advisory Group, says investor mindsets have changed, and memories of the financial crisis are still fresh. That means the public could grow more bullish in surveys and the like, yet not cut loose on savings and deploy cash into the market.“When the crisis occurred and then the country started to come out of it, a lot of households changed their behavior, paid down debt and then accumulated savings,” Bogdanova said. “So while there’s a lot of savings on the sidelines, we may not be at the point where those savings gets freed up to flow into the market heavily because people are still in the mindset of being cautious.”To contact the reporter on this story: Sarah Ponczek in New York at sponczek2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Dave Liedtka, Rita NazarethFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chat-chuck-schwab-inspired-p-195952914.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-09	2019-12-09 13:00:09	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Bank of America Expands Free Trading to Legions of Merrill Edge Customers	(Bloomberg) -- Bank of America Corp. is expanding commission-free trading -- again.The lender said it will give unlimited free stock trades to all customers on its Merrill Edge Self-Directed platform, seven weeks after handing that perk to members of its Preferred Rewards loyalty program. The move, announced in a statement Monday, follows Charles Schwab Corp.’s decision to eliminate charges and acquire TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for about $26 billion. It all underscores fierce competition in the discount-brokerage business.“Everyone is aggressive right now, because the question is: How do you prove value, how do you attract clients?” Aron Levine, Bank of America’s head of consumer banking and investments, said in a phone interview. “We want to make sure that all clients who are interested in our platform have access to it in a comparable way to the rest of the industry.”As other firms face pressure to bulk up through mergers, Bank of America will focus on boosting activity among its existing clients, Levine said. The company has about 66 million consumer and small business clients.“We look at a client holistically,” Levine said. That means the lender can make money on customers’ broader financial activities, including banking, credit cards and mortgages, rather than focusing purely on brokerage revenue. Any lost revenue from the latest move will be marginal, given 87% of trades were already commission-free, he said.To contact the reporter on this story: Lananh Nguyen in New York at lnguyen35@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

2019-12-07	2019-12-07 12:00:00	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Traders Are Already Bracing for a Wild Week Ahead	(Bloomberg) -- Investors face a crush of events next week that could sweep away the biggest hurdles to a full-blown race into riskier assets, if things line up just right.Over the second half of the week, possible catalysts for a Treasury market sell-off will arrive in close succession: Policy decisions from the U.S. and euro-zone central banks are expected to offer no fresh hints of easing in the cards, and the U.K. election could finally pave a more resolute course for an exit from the European Union.Treasuries were already on the ropes Friday, thanks to a U.S. payrolls report that surpassed analysts’ expectations. That pushed the S&P 500 to the brink of a record high, drove market pricing for a full Federal Reserve rate cut to the end of 2020, and thrust the 10-year yield toward the upper end of its recent range, at around 1.84%.The events ahead will determine the macroeconomic backdrop heading into the new year, but the question for investors is how much of the real action next week is already baked in. For Kathy Jones at Charles Schwab & Co., the more pressing issue remains U.S.-China trade talks. The big catalyst for risk appetite and significantly higher yields in one of the last actively traded weeks of the year would be a credible signal that the U.S. will forgo the additional tariffs it’s threatening to impose on Chinese goods on Dec. 15, she said.“We do have a confluence of things next week and there’s a good likelihood that yields will rise -- but will they just rip higher?” said Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab. “You’d need some really surprisingly good news on the trade war.”Global growth headwinds from trade friction have helped pull benchmark U.S. 10-year yields down about 80 basis points in 2019, driving Treasuries to a 7.3% return this year through Dec. 5. It’s shaping up to be the best annual performance since 2011.Some SwayAnd in Jones’s view, economic numbers could still have sway.Treasuries could take a hit ahead of the week’s high-profile events if the consumer price index reading due Dec. 11, the same day as the Fed decision, shows an annual increase faster than the expected 2%. That could unsettle the widely held view that inflation pressures are nowhere near strong enough to fit the Fed’s stated criteria for a rate hike. But there’s also potential for yields to fall should the Dec. 13 retail sales figures counter the market’s conviction that the U.S. consumer is holding up.While the data may fall short of alarming the Fed’s inflation hawks, it’s clear from Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent statements that his view of the economy is biased toward optimism -- as a glass “more than half full.”There hasn’t been much in comments from Fed speakers to suggest they’ve downgraded projections for interest rates -- which will be updated Wednesday -- since September. At the time, the “dot plot” of policy makers’ views suggested that the majority see the next move as a hike rather than a cut, and most expect rates to remain on hold or move higher in 2020.Whichever way traders see the risks tilting through year-end, the coming week could be one of the last good opportunities of the decade to jump into the fray, before clearing out for the holidays.What to WatchMuch of the potentially market-moving action in the week ahead is offshore, with the European Central Bank’s decision and the U.K. election. But markets will also be looking for signs of movement in trade talks ahead of the Dec. 15 U.S. tariff deadlineThe FOMC’s meeting tops the domestic agenda:Dec. 11: FOMC rate decision and Powell press conferenceDec. 13: New York Fed’s John Williams discusses topics in monetary policyHere’s the economic calendar:Dec. 10: NFIB small business optimism; nonfarm productivity; unit labor costsDec. 11: MBA mortgage applications; consumer price index; real average earnings; monthly budget statementDec. 12: Producer price index; jobless claims; Bloomberg consumer comfort; household change in net worthDec. 13: Import/export prices; retail sales; Bloomberg U.S. economic survey; business inventoriesAnd the auction schedule:Dec. 9: $42 billion of 13-week bills; $36 billion of 26-week bills; $38 billion 3-year notesDec. 10: $24 billion of 10-year notesDec. 12: 4-, 8-week bills; 30-year bond re-openingTo contact the reporter on this story: Emily Barrett in New York at ebarrett25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Mark Tannenbaum, Nick BakerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/traders-brace-wild-week-awaiting-120000765.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-02	2019-12-02 15:51:39	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	The Man You Brought Tech and Humor to the Brokerage Business	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Talk about timing: Masters in Business sat down with Joe Ricketts, founder of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., on Nov. 12 and 10 days later Charles Schwab Corp. offered to buy TD for $26 billion (Ricketts still owns more than 8% of the company).TD Ameritrade has its roots in First Omaha Securities, a Midwest retail brokerage firm that Ricketts started in 1975. First Omaha introduced a series of technological firsts that helped drive its rise: It was the first to advertise a toll-free telephone service for investors to call and place buy and sell orders, and it was the first to provide price quotes and accept orders via touch-tone phone. Not so novel today, but big innovations more than 30 years ago. In 1995, the company became the first brokerage firm to handle online trading over the internet.In an attempt to cut through the clutter, Ricketts tried to use humor to reach potential clients. Ameritrade became famous for its slack stick dot-com-era TV advertising. The best known was the “Let’s Light This Candle” ad, featuring Stuart the office boy as the main character. It became a viral meme before such things even existed. First Omaha bought lots of other regional brokers, eventually going public in 1997 and later merging with TD Waterhouse in 2006. Now it's TD that's being bought.Ricketts is the author of &quot;The Harder You Work, the Luckier You Get: An Entrepreneur’s Memoir.&quot; His family trust has owned the Chicago Cubs since 2009; the team won the World Series in 2016, its first championship in 108 years.

But all apps aren't created equal, and some are easier to use and more consumer friendly. Then there are the free investment management apps and others that require a fee.Following are a few investment apps with solid reviews and free portfolio management software. Which Investment Apps Have Good Reviews?QuickenThe free Quicken mobile app is a companion to the computer-based Quicken investment and financial management platform. Launched in 1991, this is one of the grandfathers of financial management. Quicken enables users to manage their investments, although not buy and sell, through the app.This app is not a standalone, but once your computer-based financial management system is set up on the Quicken platform, you can use the app on the go.With a 4.6 rating, out of 3,500 reviews, this app offers a lot for those seeking a comprehensive money app.Personal CapitalThe free Personal Capital financial management tools are so popular that the company claims more than 2 million users. The Personal Capital investment tracker is a close second to Quicken's paid product. After uploading your financial data you can access a multitude of reports and information including: net worth and account balances, budgeting help and investment check-ups. Personal Capital's retirement planner and fee analyzer both stand up well to other paid apps.This company also offers paid investment management services, but anyone can download the free app to manage their investments.SigFig Wealth ManagementSigFig is a robo-advisor with a free online portfolio tracker. With a &quot;freemium&quot; model, similar to Personal Capital, it offers many useful investment management features. With the free SigFig app, users can monitor their investments, asset allocation, fundamentals and returns.The SigFig Wealth Management app received strong reviews and the company promises to keep the app free. Like Personal Capital, SigFig also offers a paid investment management service. More About MintRun by Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), the same firm that owns Quicken, Mint is known for a money management web-based platform. Appropriate for small investors, newbies to financial management might appreciate the Mint app. The app is great for income and expense tracking as well as budgeting.In the Mint against Quicken app competition, the Quicken app wins for sophisticated investors. But on Mint, investors can compare their portfolio to market benchmarks and view asset allocations across all accounts. The app offers tips and advice for both active and passive investors and a sound tool for beginning and intermediate users. The Bottom Line on Investing AppsThere are many investment apps that can help manage your investments on the go. Additionally, each investment brokerage company also offers their own apps. So if you have investments through Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) or Fidelity, their apps will enable you to manage just your holdings holdings at the respective firm. Unfortunately, these apps won't provide a holistic view of your investments across a realm of accounts.Although you can manage your investments with an app, you may not want to.Once your investment portfolio becomes more sizable, managing your holdings on a phone or tablet may be insufficient. The benefit of a larger screen and the privacy of secure internet in your residence might be preferable to managing your investments with an app.Ultimately, the convenience of investing apps is handy. Only you can decide whether to handle a large portfolio on the fly.As of this writing, Barbara Friedberg did not hold any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-26	2019-11-26 12:14:10	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Developed Stocks Hit a Record as Merger Mania Tops $70 Billion	(Bloomberg) -- A buyout frenzy is taking hold of boardrooms from Tokyo to San Francisco, and it’s adding fuel to a record-breaking rally across the world’s major stock markets.More than $70 billion of deals has already been announced this week, with Charles Schwab Corp.’s $26 billion buyout of discount brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. leading the pack. Luxury goods giant LVMH, Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG and Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Corp. are among a slew of companies which have also announced multibillion-dollar transactions.For investors, the sudden burst of activity is being seen as a vote of confidence in the outlook as recession fears ebb and the U.S. and China edge toward a trade deal. The S&P 500 Index, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite Index all closed Monday at records, and the MSCI World Index of developed-market stocks was trading at an all-time high on Tuesday.“The recent M&A explosion reflects an undeniable economic optimism,” said Brock Silvers, managing director at Adamas Asset Management in Hong Kong. “The U.S. enjoys both low inflation and unemployment, while the Fed looks dovish, and trade talks are rumored to be nearing an initial success. Investment capital is plentiful and cheap.”That cheap cost of funding is the common denominator across the deals, which have motives ranging from industry consolidation to diversifying into new markets. Policy makers across the world have been cutting interest rates in a bid to shore up economic growth, and the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have even been forced to expand their balance sheets.Given the low cost of borrowing, it’s surprising there hasn’t been even more merger and acquisition activity, according to Rhett Kessler, senior fund manager at Sydney-based Pengana Capital Group Ltd., which oversees about A$3 billion ($2 billion).For all the optimism spurred by the flurry of dealmaking, there are reasons for caution. Merger and acquisition activity typically tends to peak along with the business cycle, meaning some market participants will read this as a late-cycle signal. Meanwhile deals like Schwab’s purchase of TD Ameritrade are symptoms of structural industry changes, rather than the health of the economy.Investor exuberance beyond the U.S. appears more measured. While the Stoxx Europe 600 is at about the highest since May 2015 and Japan’s Topix Index touched the strongest level this year on Tuesday, both lag the performance of the S&P 500 in 2019.There were at least 10 deal announcements worth $1 billion or more on Monday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Here’s a rundown of the key details:Industry ConsolidationCharles Schwab, the San Francisco-based brokerage, announced it would acquire TD Ameritrade, amid a collapse in investing costs as providers embrace $0 feesCanada’s Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. announced a C$4.9 billion ($3.7 billion) all-share agreement to buy Detour Gold Corp.EBay Inc. is selling its ticket marketplace StubHub to European rival Viagogo for $4.05 billion in cashBranching OutLVMH, the luxury giant that already sells everything from Louis Vuitton bags to Dom Perignon champagne, is adding the 182-year-old U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co., known for its robin’s egg blue boxesNovartis AG agreed to buy Medicines Co. and its promising heart drug for $9.7 billion, the latest move in the Swiss drugmaker’s push to amass novel treatments for complex conditionsCanadian convenience-store giant Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. offered A$8.6 billion ($5.8 billion) for fuel retailer Caltex Australia Ltd., sweetening its bid for about 2,000 sites as it seeks to broaden a global expansionJapan Goes AbroadAsahi Kasei is buying Veloxis Pharmaceuticals for $1.3 billion, the latest of a series of deals by Japanese drugmakersMitsubishi Corp. and Chubu Electric Power Co. are expected to buy Eneco of the Netherlands after being selected as the preferred bidders.

2019-11-26	2019-11-26 00:21:01	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	In a $0 Fee World, Charles Schwab Muscles Its Way to the Top	(Bloomberg) -- For decades, Charles Schwab Corp. quietly plotted to unleash its ultimate weapon against rivals: $0 fees.Schwab considered eliminating charges in the 1990s after the advent of online trading, and again in the 2000s during the financial crisis, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Each time, it dismissed the idea as too risky -- a danger to its own bottom line.But with investing costs collapsing across Wall Street, the San Francisco-based firm finally took the leap in October -- and, in a matter of weeks, it drove a major rival into its arms.On Monday, days after reports of a possible acquisition first surfaced, Schwab formally announced that it would acquire TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. in an all-stock deal valued at roughly $26 billion.The deal caps a year of off-again-on-again negotiations and cements Schwab’s position in the industry it pioneered a half-century ago.For TD Ameritrade, one of Schwab’s keenest rivals, the tie-up is an acknowledgment of a stark, new reality: One of finance’s most basic businesses, stock trading, has become so mundane that brokers are giving it away for free.Schwab played its hand deftly. First, it sent shockwaves through its industry -- and sent TD Ameritrade stock into a tailspin -- by abruptly announcing last month that it would allow customers to trade stocks and exchange-traded funds for free. Then, it reentered talks that culminated in Monday’s announcement.Chief Executive Officer Walt Bettinger was blunt in early November, telling Schwab clients that discount brokers were headed for a shakeout. But as recently as last week, the company’s Chief Financial Officer, Peter Crawford, was holding his cards close in discussions with industry executives.“What a poker player,” Matt Witkos, head of global distribution at Eaton Vance Corp. in Boston, said of Crawford. “It was pretty shocking.”Falling CostsTradecraft aside, Schwab and TD Ameritrade are both responding to the tectonic shifts in their business. Price competition extends beyond commissions to investment products, too: Fidelity Investments is now charging nothing at all for a handful of its funds.Pressure has been intensifying: In the 1970s, Schwab charged about $70 for a stock trade. By the 1990s, the price had dropped to as little as $30, and in the mid-2000s it cost about $13. After Schwab’s move in October, it was free.The race to zero, after so many years of resistance, partly reflects a generational shift. While many baby boomers are accustomed to paying fees, younger people have come to expect free trading from a new crop of competitors such as Robinhood Financial.Schwab’s TD Ameritrade deal, expected to close in the second half of 2020, would create a formidable giant with $5 trillion in assets. The company would be so large that some analysts have said the deal might draw antitrust scrutiny.Bettinger, the CEO, flicked away those concerns on a call with analysts Monday.“We have numerous competitors, many of which are far larger than us today and far larger than a combined organization,” he said, naming Fidelity and Vanguard Group among the bigger challengers. “They’re going to continue to come right after us, as they are now in all aspects of the business.”Toronto-Dominion Bank, which owns 43% of TD Ameritrade, initially reached out to Schwab, people familiar with the matter said.Schwab’s eliminating of fees prompted TD Ameritrade and other rivals to follow suit. In the wake of the move, TD Bank again reached out to Schwab to restart the discussions, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.Representatives for TD Bank declined to comment.The marriage of Schwab and its smaller Midwest rival left independent advisers and competitor firms scrambling to decode how the combined company will transform the brokerage business, which has already undergone considerable upheaval in recent years.Schwab worked its way up the food chain by leaning into the “discount” part of the discount brokerage business, fueling more than a decade of expansion.The firm got its start in the 1970s by undercutting Wall Street firms that would charge hundreds of dollars per order. It thrived on comparatively low-cost trading into the 1990s, moving online to compete with upstarts including E*Trade Financial Corp.But Schwab lost its way in the early 2000s, charging more than competitors for trading and juggling disparate business lines. To reverse course, founder Charles Schwab returned to the helm and refocused on one thing: cheap fees. That decision to reconnect to the discount ethos helped it grow to its dominant position today.“The logic of Schwab has been -- will always be -- to reduce commissions,” said Robert Burgelman, professor of management at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, who’s followed Schwab for two decades and written case studies on the company.Schwab was able to kneecap its competitors last month with zero fees in part because it relies less on trading for income.Its other business lines include adviser services and its own low-cost investment products. And the firm earns most of its revenue from reinvesting customer cash through its bank division. When falling interest rates threatened that income stream, Schwab announced in September that it was cutting 3% of its staff or about 600 jobs.Monday’s announced deal puts additional heat on E*Trade, which was long thought to be a potential acquisition target for TD Ameritrade. After falling 9% on the day news of Schwab’s move broke, E*Trade’s shares rose more than 3% on Monday.“Frankly, if I’m on the E*Trade board I’m certainly feeling a sense of urgency to find a buyer,” said Thomas Bradley, former president of TD Ameritrade.An E*Trade spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours.Some advisers were on edge about the tie-up. Those who use Schwab to safeguard assets wonder if they’ll be able to maintain the same level of service, especially for smaller clients.“Less competition can lead to less negotiating power,” said Matt Cosgriff, a wealth management group leader at BerganKDV.Roger Ward, principal wealth adviser at TrueWealth Management in Atlanta, said that Schwab’s dominant position in the industry made Monday’s announcement almost inevitable.“When they change course it can take time,” he said of the 20,000-person company. “But when they get on the desired course, they are financially strong enough and culturally motivated enough to roll over smaller contributors like TD Ameritrade.”&#92;--With assistance from Suzanne Woolley, Michael McDonald, Matt Turner and Doug Alexander.To contact the reporters on this story: Annie Massa in New York at amassa12@bloomberg.net;Matthew Monks in New York at mmonks1@bloomberg.net;John Gittelsohn in Los Angeles at johngitt@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sam Mamudi at smamudi@bloomberg.net, David GillenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/0-fee-world-charles-schwab-002101574.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-25	2019-11-25 17:27:54	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Schwab's Mammoth Deal Has to Win Over the Little Guy, Too	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s official: Charles Schwab Corp. has agreed to buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for $26 billion in an all-stock transaction. Now the question on Wall Street is whether the acquisition, which would create a behemoth with $5 trillion in assets, will come under scrutiny from antitrust regulators. There are a number of arguments for an antitrust review. For one, Schwab is the market leader in safeguarding assets managed by registered investment advisers, holding about half the market. By purchasing TD Ameritrade, it would add another 15% to 20% share, according to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. The deal also could allow Schwab to boost fees on other services, or reduce interest paid to investors on their accounts. Effectively, the company eliminated commissions for U.S. stocks, exchange-traded funds and options, but that headline-grabbing move could very well mask hidden charges elsewhere.Bloomberg News’s Felice Maranz and David McLaughlin compiled a roundup of analysts’ expectations. Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg suggested regulatory scrutiny could stretch into the third quarter of 2020. UBS’s Brennan Hawken sees “a lot of execution risk.” Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Carrier said Toronto-Dominion Bank’s 43% stake in TD Ameritrade could cause “some complications,” including tougher regulatory approval.While the potential hurdles are very real and Wall Street’s concern about them are valid, I’d add another concern: namely, that combining Schwab and TD Ameritrade could be considered “anti-trust” in a different way.One of Schwab’s main competitors, Fidelity Investments, was quick to release a statement on Monday that piggybacked on some of these concerns, noting that &quot;acquisitions of this size can be long, complex, and unsettling.” Kathy Murphy, president of Fidelity’s Personal Investing business, added this:“Unfortunately for investors, the combination of Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade means they will likely be doubling down on revenue practices that directly disadvantage investors, including paying extremely low cash sweep rates and taking significant payment for order flow. These practices can easily outweigh any benefit of $0 online commissions.”Schwab’s path forward most likely lies in expanding its reach in financial advisory services. That’s a highly personal industry by nature. Sure, some people are willing to take financial planning into their own hands, or use algorithms to help them invest. But even with the internet democratizing all aspects of society, it still feels like the average person would want to have someone holding their hand as they lay out a strategy to buy a house, or send children to college, or save most efficiently for retirement. When it comes to bond markets, for instance, it’s clear that a good chunk of investors don’t have a good handle on what fixed income is all about.   Walt Bettinger, Schwab’s chief executive officer, said in a statement that the combined firm will “be uniquely positioned to serve the investment, trading and wealth management needs of investors across every phase of their financial journeys.” It’s an open question, though, whether Americans prefer to use a massive institution as a one-stop shop. As Cowen’s Seiberg pointed out, there’s something of a growing “anti-big business” sentiment focused on large banks and technology companies. Schwab would seem to be the cross-section of both of those targets.Many details on Schwab’s acquisition and the potential synergies are still to come. But industry consolidation and the growing emphasis on technological innovation will clearly put increased pressure on its small and mid-sized competitors. For those firms, “the risk is that they lose market share, including in smaller communities where more personal brick-and-mortar financial services are harder to come by,” according to Bankrate.com senior economic analyst Mark Hamrick. I’ve written before about how finance industry professionals can easily get lured into sweeping generalizations. In the case of discount online brokers, the line is that no-fee trading is a big win for the consumer. “I’ve been on that pursuit, that mission basically for almost 40 years,” Charles Schwab (the founder) said after the company’s move to zero commissions. “We just hope more people will come and enjoy the benefits that Schwab provides.”If successful, this combination will almost surely bring more investors under Schwab’s tent. It’s up to the company to convince them that even as an industry giant, it’ll always keep the little guy in mind.To contact the author of this story: Brian Chappatta at bchappatta1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2019-11-25	2019-11-25 16:41:45	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	TD Would Unlock Value by Selling Schwab Stake, CIBC Says	(Bloomberg) -- Toronto-Dominion Bank sees “significant value” from Charles Schwab Corp.’s purchase of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. -- but that will only be realized if the Canadian lender opts to unload its minority stake in the combined entity, according to one analyst.Schwab agreed Monday to buy the U.S. discount broker that’s 43% owned by Toronto-Dominion in a stock deal valued at $26 billion. The Canadian lender said it supports the transaction, and will exchange its ownership investment for a 13.4% stake in San Francisco-based Schwab. Toronto-Dominion said in a statement that it expects to record a “sizeable” revaluation gain when the deal closes next year.“There is significant value being created by this combination -- value that in TD’s case will only surface if or when the bank decides to monetize its stake,” CIBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Sedran said in a note to clients, adding that the deal will have a “minor near-term impact” for the bank.As part of the deal, Toronto-Dominion will get two seats on Schwab’s board and the firms agreed to a revised insured deposit account agreement that gives the Toronto-based lender a continued earnings stream. Currently, Omaha-based TD Ameritrade has a so-called sweep agreement that shifts its deposits to Toronto-Dominion’s balance sheet for a service fee. Starting July 2021, those deposit accounts, which were $103 billion as of July 31, can be reduced at Schwab’s option by up to $10 billion a year, with a floor of $50 billion. The fee under the 10-year agreement will be set at 15 basis points on closing.The earnings and capital “plusses and minuses” from the deal more or less balance each other out from Toronto-Dominion’s perspective, according to Sedran. The deal is “modestly accretive” to adjusted earnings in the second and third year, given the anticipated expense savings, he said.The transaction is expected to reduce the bank’s adjusted earnings by about C$25 million ($19 million), or 1 cent a share, in its first year, while adding C$65 million, or 4 cents, to earnings in the second year. The earnings lift will rise by the third year to C$125 million, or 7 cents, according to Toronto-Dominion.“We’re looking forward to being large beneficiaries of those synergies as they come through,” Toronto-Dominion Chief Executive Officer Bharat Masrani said Monday in an investors’ call. “I think this is the right thing for TD to do and we look forward to an ongoing relationship with Schwab and participating in this terrific combination.”Toronto-Dominion sees a potential for a C$4 billion to C$6 billion increase in the value of its investment from the deal. Shares of Toronto-Dominion rose 0.5% to C$77.44 at 11:02 a.m. trading in Toronto. A 13% stake in Schwab would be worth about $8.2 billion based on the current share price for the company.“Given that the need for scale in the ebroker sector necessitates a bigger entity than TD would like to allocate sufficient capital to, the reduction in its relative stake should not come as much of a surprise,” Barclays Plc analyst John Aiken said in a note. “As we believe that TD feels it has greater strategic priorities for its capital, we agree with the strategic rationale for a reduced ownership stake.”(Adds analyst, company comment and transaction details from sixth paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Doug Alexander in Toronto at dalexander3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

2019-11-25	2019-11-25 16:23:10	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Charles Schwab to Buy TD Ameritrade, Extending Brokerage-Industry Sway	(Bloomberg) -- Charles Schwab Corp. agreed to buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for about $26 billion in a deal that will reshape the retail brokerage business.TD Ameritrade stockholders will receive 1.0837 Schwab shares for each TD Ameritrade share, the companies said in a statement Monday. That’s a 17% premium based on the average share price as of the close on Nov. 20.Announcement of the deal comes after news of an acquisition broke on Thursday, sending up shares of both firms. Schwab, America’s original discount broker, will now have even more sway over the sector it pioneered nearly a half-century ago.“Our view is that this is a great deal for the consumer,” Schwab Chief Executive Officer Walt Bettinger said on a conference call Monday with analysts. “We’ve been doing nothing but driving costs down for decades.”The equity value of the deal is $28.3 billion based on Schwab’s closing price of $48.20 on Nov. 22. Schwab shares fell 0.3% at 10:16 a.m. in New York trading. TD Ameritrade, the Omaha-based brokerage that’s partly owned by Toronto-Dominion Bank, rose 4%.The tie-up creates a mega-firm with $5 trillion in assets -- a Goliath that may attract the attention of antitrust regulators, analysts say. Smaller brokerages like E*Trade Financial Corp. will have to contend with a much more formidable competitor.The combined firm will relocate its headquarters to Schwab’s new campus in Westlake, Texas. Schwab’s San Francisco operations will remain a sizable hub.TD Bank, which holds 43% of TD Ameritrade, will own roughly 13% of the new business. Its voting stake will be limited to 9.9%, with the rest of its position in a non-voting class of stock. The Canadian lender will have two new seats on the combined firm’s board, while TD Ameritrade will name a single director.As a result of the deal, Schwab will see its business add 12 million client accounts, $1.3 trillion in assets, and roughly $5 billion a year in revenue.Bettinger downplayed the potential antitrust risks of the combination.“We have numerous competitors, many of which are far larger than us today and far larger than a combined organization,” he said on the call. “They’re going to continue to come right after us, as they are now in all aspects of the business.”Schwab said in the statement that the new firm will have “the resources of a large financial services institution that will be uniquely positioned to serve the investment, trading and wealth management needs of investors across every phase of their financial journeys.”Schwab last month eliminated commissions for U.S. stock trading, forcing other brokerages to follow suit and sweeping away an important revenue stream. Analysts speculated that online brokerages might have to cut deals to survive the increased industry pressure.TD Ameritrade has relied more on commissions than some competitors, drawing 36% of its net revenue from commissions in 2018, compared to 7% at Schwab.QuickTake: Farewell, Fees? How Zero-Cost Investing Caught OnFounder Charles Schwab hinted he was open to dealmaking in an interview with Bloomberg Radio in October.“I don’t know whether we’ll be successful in that pursuit, but in the industry you’re going to see more consolidation, more firms getting together,” he said. “You just have to have that scale and volume.”If the deal goes through, the combined company will have unparalleled clout as top custody service providers to independent financial advisers. That may give authorities pause, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Kyle Voigt wrote Thursday. He estimates Schwab has about a 50% market share of registered investment adviser custody assets, while TD Ameritrade may have as much as 20%.The acquisition comes after TD Ameritrade announced in July that CEO Tim Hockey would leave early next year. Hockey denied at the time that his departure had anything to do with a potential deal.Credit Suisse Group AG advised Schwab on the deal, while PJT Partners and Sandler O’Neill & Partners advised TD Ameritrade’s board. JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised TD Bank and Barclays Plc advised the family of Joseph Ricketts, TD Ameritrade’s founder and largest individual shareholder.(Updates with names of advisers in final paragraph.

2019-11-25	2019-11-25 15:53:16	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	A $56 Billion Thanksgiving Deal Feast to Make Bankers Fat	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s the time of year to give thanks, especially if you’re a mergers-and-acquisitions banker. In what marks the merger-est Monday of 2019, the stock market awoke to four large deals, while a fifth — potentially the biggest leveraged buyout of all time — still looms. The pre-Thanksgiving holiday dealmaking frenzy centers on U.S. targets that span numerous industries: Online brokerages Charles Schwab Corp. and TD Ameritrade Holdings Corp. agreed to combine in a $26 billion all-stock merger; luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton SE is acquiring retailer Tiffany & Co. for about $18 billion; Novartis AG is buying Medicines Co., the developer of a cholesterol-lowering drug, for $7.7 billion; and EBay Inc. is selling its StubHub tickets business for about $4 billion to Viagogo Entertainment Inc. That’s as KKR & Co. has reportedly  approached Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. about taking the $54 billion pharmacy chain private.Nearly $2.7 trillion of deals were struck globally so far this year, as a merger wave now long in the tooth continues into 2020. The M&A market’s tenacity — in the face of a trade war with China, a spate of high-profile merger-related writedowns and deal duds and the possible impeachment of the leader of the free world — is pretty stunning. An index that measures CEO confidence, often looked to as an indicator of the M&A market, has slipped to levels not seen since 2016. But the S&P 500 index touched a new high on Monday, and Ebitda multiples remain elevated. Meanwhile, billions of dollars in banker fees have been generated even though dealmaking was already expected to slow. Those with the largest shares of the pie are Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JP Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley. The feast will end sooner or later, but for now, the oven’s still hot. The question remains, though: Will investors later feel they got burned?To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

It means Schwab itself, with a market capitalization of $61.7 billion, could be in the crosshairs.The catalyst is said to be Schwab's move to eliminate commissions on common stock trades. The October decision sent TD Ameritrade stock down by nearly one-third. The bid price is near where AMTD stood prior to slashing commissions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the Schwab bid didn't come out of the blue. It was prompted by competition from a smaller fintech, Robinhood. It launched no-fee trading in 2013 and was valued at $7.6 billion in its latest funding round. The Debt, The Debt, The DebtThe problem for Charles Schwab and for all brokers is technology debt, the same force driving credit card processors together to compete with Square (NYSE:SQ).Once a technological solution is put in place, a company immediately starts accumulating technology debt, as new and cheaper solutions become possible. Robinhood is built on the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS cloud, while older brokerages were built on mainframes.Assuming the deal gets done, Schwab and Ameritrade face the task of integrating disparate hardware operations, software teams and tools. Only their larger scales will let them do this. Schwab has also been gearing up to allow the purchase of fractional shares, which is expected to be a challenge to the mutual fund industry.Schwab's elimination of trading fees brought it 142,000 new accounts in October alone. Another big surge is expected early next year, when Schwab takes on 11 million brokerage accounts from USAA, a privately owned organization. That deal also brings $7 billion of cash on which Schwab will pay much less than USAA was offering. It's small spreads on cash balances, and other fees earned from just handling money, that make up for the elimination of commissions. Should You Buy Schwab Stock?Schwab was founded in 1971 and TD Ameritrade four years later. Schwab spent a reported $313 million in advertising last year. TD Ameritrade was reported to be spending $62 million per quarter on ads three years ago. Together they probably represent $2 billion in ad billings. Some of that money, along with management savings, can help offset system integration costs.Schwab brings in $10 billion of revenue each year and Ameritrade about $5.8 billion. Together they reported net income of $5.8 billion last year. This may be why Schwab stock also popped, by over 7%, once its bid was announced. E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC), on the other hand, dropped by 9%.Consolidation could continue if larger financial players decide to come in. The big banks, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C), all do brokerage, and their systems are now as automated as the discounters. The merger mania, in other words, may have just begun. The Bottom Line on Charles Schwab and TD AmeritradeThe cost of bringing financial transaction processing from the mainframe era into the cloud era is enormous. For companies to survive, they must do it at scale, so the costs are spread out across giant balances and transaction volumes.That's why the rise of fintech has caused a merger mania across the financial landscape. Robinhood has been trying to obtain a bank charter, but various technology missteps have so far kept it out.Once it does get such a charter, expect banks to start merging the way the credit card processors and brokerages are.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-11-21	2019-11-21 20:30:28	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Schwab-Ameritrade Deal Seen Drawing Tough Antitrust Review	(Bloomberg) -- Charles Schwab Corp.’s plan to buy rival TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. could face tough antitrust scrutiny over a deal that combines two of the biggest companies that run platforms used by independent financial advisers.The tie-up would create a $5 trillion giant, advancing Schwab’s leading position as custodian for assets managed by financial advisers. That could raise antitrust concerns even as competition among brokerages is driving down fees for investors.“We think this deal may face somewhat significant antitrust hurdles,” Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Kyle Voigt said in a note Thursday.Schwab is the number one player in the market for safeguarding assets managed by registered investment advisers, followed by Fidelity Investments, Voigt said. Schwab may hold about half of the market, while TD Ameritrade may have around 15% to 20%, he said. TD Ameritrade surged as much as 26% Thursday -- the most in 20 years -- while Schwab rallied 14%.Schwab Nears Deal to Buy TD Ameritrade in Industry OverhaulStill, the market is fairly fragmented with smaller competitors and falling management fees have been a boon to investors, a trend that looks unlikely to change, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst David Ritter.“It’s hard to imagine that that train is going to be slowed by one merger like this,” he said.One of the last major deals in the industry -- TD Ameritrade’s acquisition of Scottrade in 2017 -- won approval from U.S. antitrust officials without conditions. Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada’s second-largest lender by assets, owns a 43% stake in TD Ameritrade.Although fees are going down for consumers, antitrust officials will focus on whether the deal will mean less competition for the interest paid to investors on their accounts and whether fees on other services could rise, said Robert Litan, a partner at Korein Tillery and a former official with the Justice Department’s antitrust division. The tie-up will likely be reviewed by the Justice Department, he said, instead of the Federal Trade Commission, which also reviews mergers.“The intense competition in the industry has forced them to go to zero commissions, but that doesn’t mean that the market still isn’t susceptible to having consumers hurt as a result of further consolidation,” he said.Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note that the takeover will get significant scrutiny from regulators that could stretch into the third quarter of 2020, though he said he expects it will be completed before the next presidential inauguration.“The concern is that this becomes political,” Seiberg said. “Democratic candidates including Senator Elizabeth Warren have been railing against big tech and big banks. It is easy to see how this could get drawn into this anti-big business campaign.”Here’s a sample of other commentary on the deal:UBS, Brennan HawkenThe very large and surprising deal “carries a lot of execution risk,” particularly regarding legal and regulatory issues, Hawken warned in a note.Hurdles include the “size the combined entity would represent in the discount brokerage space,” even if regulators were to take into account full-service wealth management firms like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp., he said. Schwab cutting commissions and then bidding for its “most hindered” competitor might also draw legal challenges and further anti-competitive scrutiny, Hawken said.Hawken added that E*Trade was “left out in the cold,” and appears vulnerable as it had begun to reflect an M&A premium and the Schwab-Ameritrade tie-up would reduce the number of potential buyers. E*Trade slumped as much as 10% today.BofA, Michael CarrierTD Ameritrade’s relationship with holder Toronto-Dominion Bank “creates some complications,” Carrier wrote, including “dis-synergies and a bit tougher regulatory approvals.”Carrier expects merger discussions and activity in the sector in the near term, which is likely to benefit online broker stocks. He sees the Schwab-Ameritrade deal making “strategic sense” as the two have similar business models, particularly regarding retail and registered investment adviser, or RIA, platforms, and TD Ameritrade lacks a permanent CEO.Most firms in the sector, including E*Trade, will likely conduct merger talks given the “pressures on the business, this transaction, game theory, as well as the attractive synergies and accretion,” he said. Shares of companies that get left out may face pressure.Vital Knowledge, Adam CrisafulliNews of Schwab potentially buying TD Ameritrade may weigh on some asset managers as the combined company would be able to exert even more pressure on industry fees, Crisafulli wrote.National Bank, Gabriel DechaineA Schwab deal to acquire TD Ameritrade may be helpful for Toronto-Dominion Bank’s long-term U.S. strategy, according to Dechaine.Toronto-Dominion may end up with 10% to 15% stake in the combined entity, assuming an “all-stock transaction and no additional deal twists,” he said in a note to clients.“Assuming a smaller stake in a bigger player situation, TD could have a more liquid asset that it could potentially sell to finance a future U.S. regional bank acquisition,” Dechaine said. “As such, it would make it easier for TD to make future acquisitions accretive.”(Updates with antitrust analysis starting in second paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Doug Alexander and Joshua Fineman.To contact the reporters on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.net;David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, ;Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Divya BaljiFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-ameritrade-deal-seen-drawing-203028909.html?.tsrc=rss

U.S. discount broker Charles Schwab Corp. is in talks to buy rival TD Ameritrade in a $26 billion deal that would create an online brokerage behemoth, according to media reports. The discount brokerage business model is facing increasing pressure, as financial technology disruptors like Robinhood pushed legacy firms to cut commissions to zero, and the increased use of technology has required huge spending on platforms. The solution to managing costs is getting bigger and acquiring more clients, which is exactly what Schwab could achieve by acquiring its smaller rival.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-schwab-td-ameritrade-deal-171953498.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-11-21	2019-11-21 17:14:16	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Schwab’s Deal to Buy TD Ameritrade Boosts Billionaire Founders	(Bloomberg) -- Charles Schwab Corp.’s plan to buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for $26 billion is proving a boon for the fortunes anchored by two of America’s biggest brokerages.TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts is set to add $400 million to his $2.4 billion net worth after his firm’s shares rose 21% in Thursday. Charles Schwab’s $8.8 billion fortune will increase by about $500 million based on his company’s gains. The deal is worse news for Thomas Peterffy, chairman of rival Interactive Brokers Group Inc., whose net worth was down about $100 million at 11:50 a.m. in New York.The transaction could be announced as early as Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter. It would create a firm with roughly $5 trillion in combined assets, consolidating an industry under pressure from a price war that escalated when Schwab last month announced plans to eliminate commissions for U.S. stocks, exchange traded funds and options.The combination may pose a threat to fund managers such as Vanguard Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc., according to Bill Capuzzi, chief executive officer of Apex Clearing, a custodian that focuses on fintech firms.“It signals Schwab is going to continue to lean really hard into the advisory side,” he said. “A gigantic percentage of the advisory world will be leveraging one firm for passive custody and clearing services.”For Schwab, the net worth gain may be particularly sweet. In an October interview, he criticized wealth taxes like those proposed by Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as a “negative reward for success.”Other winners from the potential acquisition include Toronto-Dominion Bank, which owns 43% of TD Ameritrade, and Canadian insurer Sun Life Financial Inc. with a 3.9% position as of Sept. 30. Generation Investment Management LLP, the firm co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, owned a 2% stake in Schwab at the end of the third quarter.(Updates net worth totals in second paragraph, adds Apex CEO’s comment in fourth.)To contact the reporter on this story: Tom Metcalf in London at tmetcalf7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, ;Michael J.

2019-11-21	2019-11-21 15:53:03	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Schwab Seizes on Industry Turmoil With Plan to Buy TD Ameritrade	(Bloomberg) -- First, Charles Schwab Corp. upended the retail brokerage business by cutting commissions to zero. Now, it’s seizing on the turmoil it unleashed to acquire one of its biggest rivals, TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.Just weeks after Schwab stunned competitors by letting customers trade stocks for free, the company is moving to tighten its grip on the industry with talks to acquire TD Ameritrade, according to a person familiar with the matter.The deal would give Schwab, America’s original discount broker, even more sway over the industry it pioneered nearly a half-century ago -- and an edge in the intensifying battle for ordinary investors’ dollars, and the investment adviser business. The tie-up would result in a $5 trillion titan, but analysts say it could attract antitrust scrutiny.“An acquisition of TD Ameritrade would expand Schwab’s roster of active traders and solidify its leading position serving independent advisers,” said David Ritter, a financials analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.A transaction could be announced as early as Thursday, the person said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private. The companies didn’t immediately respond to emails and phone calls seeking comment.TD Ameritrade jumped about 20% at 10:33 a.m. in New York trading, the most since 2008. Schwab gained 8.1% after earlier rising as much as 14%.Shares of E*Trade Financial Corp., which analysts have speculated TD Ameritrade might want to buy, fell 9%. A deal between its two rivals could leave smaller brokerage E*Trade contending with a more formidable competitor than ever.Schwab’s move to zero commissions forced other brokerages to follow suit and triggered a slump in the shares of firms, with TD Ameritrade among the hardest hit. It swept away a revenue stream and rekindled speculation that online brokerages might have to cut deals to survive the increased industry pressure.TD Ameritrade has relied more on commissions than some competitors, drawing 36% of its net revenue from commissions in 2018, compared to 7% at Schwab.For founder Charles Schwab, ending commissions has been a longtime goal.“I hated commissions,” Schwab said at the Impact 2019 conference in San Diego. “I hated them then. I hate ’em now. I took ’em away.”Schwab had also hinted he was open to deal-making.“I don’t know whether we’ll be successful in that pursuit, but in the industry you’re going to see more consolidation, more firms getting together,” he in an interview with Bloomberg Radio in October. “You just have to have that scale and volume. So we’re prepared to do it if the opportunity arises. If not we’re perfectly happy to go it alone.”A deal between the two companies could face anti-trust scrutiny, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Kyle Voigt wrote in a client note Thursday.Schwab and TD Ameritrade are both top custody service providers to independent financial advisers, which could give authorities pause. Voigt estimates Schwab has about a 50% market share of registered investment adviser custody assets, while TD Ameritrade may have up to 20%.An acquisition would come at a time of transition for TD Ameritrade. The Omaha-based brokerage said in a surprise announcement in July that Chief Executive Officer Tim Hockey would leave no later than the end of February 2020, rekindling questions of whether it would pursue a deal. Hockey denied that his departure had anything to do with a potential deal at the time. Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada’s second-largest lender by assets, owns a 43% stake in TD Ameritrade.Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA Research, said that a tie-up of the two firms could help address the burn of zero commissions with increased scale.“It would reduce the likelihood that investors bounce around,” he said. “They’d have a go-to destination.”Rosenbluth added that the same principle would apply for independent advisers, who increasingly choose between the two firms for clearing and trading services.“There’s scale benefits for them to provide,” he said.&#92;--With assistance from Doug Alexander and Felice Maranz.To contact the reporters on this story: Annie Massa in New York at amassa12@bloomberg.net;Matthew Monks in New York at mmonks1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sam Mamudi at smamudi@bloomberg.net, Alan MirabellaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-nears-deal-buy-td-134225210.html?.tsrc=rss

(NASDAQ: AMTD) shares jumped 24% on Thursday and Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) shares gained 11% on reports that a merger between the two online brokers could be imminent.  Fox Business reported Schwab wants to buy TD Ameritrade for $26 billion.

2019-11-21	2019-11-21 15:31:43	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Charles Schwab Takes Charge in Brave New Zero-Fee World	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- You have to hand it to Charles Schwab Corp. As the market leader in the online brokerage industry, the company seems to have realized the inevitable endgame of zero fees and consolidation and decided that it really ought to get on with it.Schwab, just seven weeks after rocking Wall Street by announcing plans to eliminate commissions for U.S. stocks, exchange-traded funds and options, is now set to buy rival TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for $26 billion, according to reports Thursday. The combined company would have an impressive $5 trillion of assets and be better equipped to step forward into this new, no-fee world than competitors such as E*Trade Financial Corp. and Interactive Brokers Group Inc. The concept of a first-mover advantage usually applies to marketing, but it’s a relevant way to think about Schwab’s strategy, too. By staying ahead of the competition, Schwab is reshaping the discount brokerage space on its terms rather than waiting to react to any changes. Bloomberg News’s Annie Massa smartly broke down the various brokerage companies’ commissions as a percentage of net revenue in 2018, which makes it obvious why Schwab chose to take the plunge toward zero fees: It stands to reason that Schwab’s calculus went something like this:Yes, our stock price will take a big hit when we announce that we’re eliminating commissions (it did, dropping to the lowest since 2016 last month). But the short-term pain will be worth it because our rivals will have no choice but to follow suit (as they did within days). Because they depend on fees much more than we do, investors should sell our competitors’ shares to a greater extent (this happened, too).  That will put us in a position to more cheaply execute the next phase of our plan, which is to grow. (It’s possible Schwab already had this deal in mind after TD Ameritrade announced in July that Chief Executive Officer Tim Hockey would leave by the end of February 2020.)Investors expressed approval of Schwab’s decision, lifting its shares as much as 13.9% on Thursday to the highest in more than a year. It’s not as if purchasing TD Ameritrade will solve all that ails the company and the online brokerage industry. But, like the consolidation in the mutual-fund space, it ensures survival. And in an era of rapid technological change on Wall Street, living to see another day and having the size and scope to keep pace with advancements is critically important. What’s next for Schwab? My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Nir Kaissar posited last month that the only option seems to be a more urgent push into financial advisory services. That will most likely be more of a grind for the company compared with the big splashes of the past two months. Schwab is competing with other market stalwarts like Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group Inc., which are more difficult to push around than its discount broker rivals.Still, even if this is the last big move for now from Schwab, it has been a whirlwind couple of months. In two sweeping moves, the company has radically reshaped an industry and positioned itself to remain the market leader for the foreseeable future.To contact the author of this story: Brian Chappatta at bchappatta1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

Total brokerage accounts climbed to 12.2 million and firmwide assets grew to a record $3.85 trillion.Schwab escalated the brokerage industry’s price war on Oct. 1 when it eliminated commissions on U.S. stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and some options. The move is likely to hit revenue but is aimed at wooing new assets to the San Francisco-based firm, which has been generating most of its income from interest earned on client cash holdings.Average interest-earning assets were $266 billion in October, little changed from September and up about 1% from a year earlier. The gain in brokerage accounts is just 7% more than October 2018.Other brokerages that cut commissions have reported divergent trends in October client activity:E*Trade Financial Corp., which announced zero commission trades shortly after Schwab, posted 9% month-over-month and year-over-year jumps in daily average revenue trades, or DARTs, a key measure of customer activity.TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.said DARTs were 11% higher in October than September but down 8% from a year earlier.Interactive Brokerage Group Inc., which announced commission-free stock and ETF trading in September, said DARTs dropped 5% month-over-month and 19% year-over-year.A more detailed picture of the bottom-line impact of the fee change will be available in January, when Schwab reports fourth-quarter results.(Adds interest earning assetsd in fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: John Gittelsohn in Los Angeles at johngitt@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sam Mamudi at smamudi@bloomberg.net, Josh Friedman, Alan MirabellaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-boosts-trading-accounts-31-151133873.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-08	2019-11-08 12:40:17	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	A One Day Earnings Rally Might Be All Square Stock Will Get	Square (NYSE:SQ) had an intriguing bull case heading into its earnings release on Wednesday afternoon. Coming out of the Q3 report, Square stock admittedly still has that bull case.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com The problem, however, is that earnings don't look quite strong enough to be the huge catalyst for which bulls were hoping.So far, SQ stock has avoided the fate which befell it after the last three quarters. But an 8% rally seems to price in the news for the quarter -- which means hoping for a rally back to 2018 highs of $100 might be too much to ask for.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips SQ Stock Holds up After EarningsFrom a headline perspective, earnings would seem bearish for SQ stock, at least if history is any guide. Both adjusted earnings per share (by 5 cents) and revenue (by a little over $5 million) came in ahead of analyst estimates. But guidance for the fourth quarter was below consensus on both lines.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Before They Roll Over That's exactly how the last three quarters played out. And each time, Square stock plunged, falling 14% after the Q2 release, 8% after Q1, and 6% (over three sessions) following the Q4 report at the end of February.This time, however, SQ stock actually gained 1.3% in after-hours trading. And the differing response does make some sense. For one, investors may finally have realized that Square guides conservatively. Second, the company's sale of Caviar to DoorDash is having a larger effect on revenue than projected, which explains the soft top-line outlook for the fourth quarter.This time around, the combination of an earnings beat and soft guidance has moved SQ stock up some 8%. That's a nice gain in context: fellow growth name Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) had a seemingly spectacular quarter and saw its shares plunge in after-hours trading. At least in terms of the initial reaction, investors seem at least content with Square's report. The Details Look MixedIt's also possible that investors are looking beyond the headline numbers -- and there were some interesting developments in the quarter.On the positive side, Square gave yet more detail on its Cash App product. Cash App seems to be competing well against PayPal Holdings' (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo, and apparently it still is.According to figures from the Q3 shareholder letter, Cash App revenue excluding bitcoin in the quarter was $159 million. PayPal said after its Q3 that Venmo had reached an annual revenue run rate just shy of $400 million -- or less than $100 million a quarter.Cash App thus seems to be outperforming Venmo. Square is seeing profits on that revenue too, with gross margins near 80%. Meanwhile, Square is adding new functionality to the app including fractional stock ownership, allowing it to compete with well-known start-up Robinhood and traditional discount broker Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), which itself is launching fractional ownership.Cash App performance seems like good news. But initial preliminary guidance for 2020 might shake investor confidence. Square said its EBITDA margins for 2020 would be roughly flat to the ~18% it expects this year.Combined with a guided revenue increase in the &quot;low 30s&quot; on a percentage basis, that suggests EPS growth next year likely below current Street estimates, which project a 41% increase.That projected revenue growth is about in line with expectations (the consensus estimate is for 33% growth). But part of the pressure on SQ stock, which still is down 38% from 2018 highs, has come from increasing fears that competition is catching up.Square management positioned the lower margins as due to sales and marketing spend needed to drive growth -- an investment that will pay for itself in a matter of quarters.  But some investors may worry that the spend is what's needed to differentiate the company in an increasingly crowded space. The Bottom Line on Square StockAgain, Square stock is cheaper, but one concern at the moment is that it isn't necessarily cheap. The 2020 consensus EPS still suggests a 60x forward multiple, and next year's estimates may come down after this quarter's commentary.Even backing out cash, price to 2020 revenue is over 4x on a GAAP basis, and around 8x using the company's 'adjusted' figure which will be discontinued after Q3. Adjusted revenue excludes transaction costs and bitcoin revenue, both of which offer minimal gross profit. In fact, Square made just $2 million in gross profit on bitcoin sales in the quarter.In the market of the last few years, those multiples don't necessarily stand out. But clearly investors have had some worries about SQ's valuation of late -- and those worries have spread to other growth stocks. Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), to which SQ stock often is compared, trades 25% below late August highs. Formerly high-flying cloud names have pulled back as well.For that reason, I argued ahead of earnings that the relatively flat trading in Square stock was bullish. It certainly seemed to give Square an opportunity to deliver an earnings release that could re-ignite optimism toward its stock. An 8% rally suggests that case did play out. The problem is that I'm skeptical there's enough in Q3 to keep that rally going.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-11-05	2019-11-05 17:47:57	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	‘I Hated Commissions,’ Says Charles Schwab After Ending Them	(Bloomberg) -- Charles Schwab, founder of the giant discount brokerage, said he has always hated charging commissions and he’s glad to be “out of the business.”“I hated commissions,” Schwab, 82, said Tuesday at the Impact 2019 conference in San Diego. “I hated them then. I hate ’em now. I took ’em away.”Charles Schwab Corp. roiled the brokerage industry when it eliminated fees for U.S. stocks, exchange traded funds and options. The move escalated a long-simmering price war spurred by investors who have moved to the cheapest investment products.Also at the conference, Schwab Chief Executive Officer Walter Bettinger said the firm plans to build its lending business for financial advisers. This will allow them to challenge bank-affiliated brokers, he said.“You’ll see us building out more capabilities when it comes to lending, so you can compete with anyone who offers lending,” Bettinger said. Schwab aims to offer loans including mortgages and other lending through registered investment advisers.While Schwab’s roots in the 1970s were as a discount broker, the company, like industry rivals, is seeking to lure more investors to its advisory business. It has a range of advice offerings, from a free basic robo-advice platform to dedicated financial advisers, whose fees can start at 0.8% of assets per year.Some on Wall Street are skeptical of the strategy. Raymond James downgraded Charles Schwab on Tuesday to market perform from outperform on skepticism the company can “meaningfully pivot towards a more advisory-type business model in a zero commission world,” analyst Patrick O’Shaughnessy wrote in a note.(Adds comments from CEO Walter Bettinger starting in the fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Felice Maranz.To contact the reporter on this story: John Gittelsohn in Los Angeles at johngitt@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sam Mamudi at smamudi@bloomberg.net, Alan Mirabella, Vincent BielskiFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hated-commissions-says-charles-schwab-171828693.html?.tsrc=rss

Despite offering zero-fee crypto trading since Feb. 2018, Robinhood’s impact on bitcoin exchanges has been, well, negligible.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/46eb6402-4545-3a05-900f-a93f6c5eca2c/stock-trading-is-virtually.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-10-28	2019-10-28 18:50:26	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Can Square Stop the Slide of SQ Stock?	When will the weakness of Square (NYSE:SQ) stock end? Despite a pretty good year for tech stocks, SQ stock has struggled throughout 2019. And lately, things have been going from bad to worse, as Square stock fell below the $60 mark again recently before making a modest recovery.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Analysts have added to the general negativity towards Square stock. More analysts have &quot;hold&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot; ratings on SQ stock than &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;outperform&quot; ratings.That's quite rare, particularly for a promising growth company like SQ. However, analysts are frustrated by Square's uneven profit margins and the lack of certainty regarding its income over the next year. That uncertainty is due to  the company's flood of investments in its non-core businesses. How should investors view the debate around SQ stock?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 AI Stocks to Buy to Profit from the Recent Tech Correction  High-Growth Stocks Have Been Under Some PressureAggressive, high-valuation growth stocks in general have not had a great autumn. The slump of multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud stocks appears to be spreading. For the time being, the collapse of WeWork has caused investors to flee many speculative growth companies. That's an understandable reaction. But some folks may be dumping good stocks along with the losers.Many of the SaaS stocks dropped as much as 30% from peak to bottom before starting to recover last week. Even payment names like Visa (NYSE:V) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) were getting hit until PayPal came through with great earnings last Wednesday.Now Square stock's drop doesn't look quite so bad. Still, the company has clearly underperformed both its payment peers and the tech sector. The Valuation of SQ Stock Is SteepThe main issue that analysts dislike about SQ stock is that its revenue growth has fallen significantly. Yet the company still hasn't become meaningfully profitable. The forward price-earnings ratio of SQ stock still comes in above 50, which is rather steep.A huge valuation multiple would make sense if Square still had a clear path to growth. However, its revenues are decelerating, with its competition mounting. It's far from certain how successful Square's investments outside of its core payment business will be, either. More than 50 times forward earnings and nearly seven times sales is not exactly a cheap price for SQ stock given those facts. Will Cash App Become a Big Success?A big part of the reason for the conflicting narratives around SQ stock is what to make of Cash App. The bulls can certainly make a solid case for Cash App being a strong driver of SQ stock going forward.The revenue of the Cash App ecosystem has reached a run rate of about $1 billion annually. Net revenues are less, of course, but they are still running well over $500 million annually at this point, making up a meaningful part of Square's overall $4 billion in annual sales.And you have to give credit to Square's management team for being innovative. It made bitcoin trading a main feature of the Cash App well before other services got into that game. Similarly, Cash App recently launched an effort to offer free stock trading within the application.Both of those specific efforts come with clear downsides, however. Bitcoin's price has never come close to reclaiming the heights of late 2017, and after a rally earlier this year, crypto is skidding lower again.Meanwhile, the effort to be the Robinhood of stock trading fell flat as Charles Schawb (NYSE:SCHW), TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) and a host of other brokerages just announced commission-free trading as well.Consumer financial services is exceptionally competitive, and it's not clear that Cash App has established much of a meaningful and durable competitive advantage. Its business has done well so far, and Square's leadership deserves credit for that. But it's hard to get a good sense of what Cash App will be worth to Square in five or ten years. There are simply too many unpredictable factors at this point. The Verdict on SQ StockI'd love to get on the bandwagon  of Square stock. There's a lot to like about SQ, particularly if it can keep evolving Cash App so it stays on top of emerging consumer trends. SQ certainly has the potential to be a stock that, over the long-run,  produces multiples of one's original investment. And with the shares down 40% from their all-time highs, the entry point is certainly reasonable.That said, there are still a few too many question marks on SQ stock for me to get completely on board. And the bull case seems a bit too easy. Payments is a difficult business; for every PayPal that succeeds, there are  a bunch of also-rans that have fallen by the wayside.Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) successfully turned things around, or at least was on the right path until recently. So folks believe that Jack Dorsey, the CEO of both companies, can  potentially achieve similar success with Square. But the payments business is harder than advertising on social media.SQ could certainly be successful. The selloff of tech stocks generally is overdone, and SQ stock will probably bounce going forward There is a lot left to prove in terms of the longer-term investment case, however.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned none of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-24	2019-10-24 19:31:38	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Square Officially Announces Free Stock Trading on Cash App	(Bloomberg) -- One more company has officially jumped on the free stock trading bandwagon. Over the next few weeks, Jack Dorsey’s Square Inc. will start allowing customers to buy and sells stocks for free on its cash payments app.The company started testing the new feature of its Cash App in September, Bloomberg earlier reported. Now, Square has begun rolling it out to non-employees, though it’s still only available to a small subset of the app’s customers, a company spokesman said. The product will be available for all users by the end of 2019.For years, free stock trading was the purview of only a few platforms like Robinhood Markets Inc., which now has a valuation of $7.6 billion. But earlier this month, one of the largest brokerages, Charles Schwab Corp., announced plans to eliminate commissions for U.S. stocks, exchange traded funds and options. TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. followed suit, slashing its commissions to zero the same day, and E*Trade Financial Corp. the day after. Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group and Interactive Brokers have also eliminated fees and commissions on a range of offerings.Square’s Cash App started out by letting users send money to friends, and has since expanded into debit cards and Bitcoin trading. While Square doesn’t consistently give updates on how many people are using Cash App, the company said it had more than 15 million monthly active users as of last December. In its most recent letter to shareholders, Square said that revenue from Cash App was $135 million for the quarter, excluding Bitcoin.To contact the reporter on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMey, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/square-officially-announces-free-stock-193138745.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-10	2019-10-10 15:59:03	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Fidelity Joins Price War With No Online Trade Commissions	(Bloomberg) -- Fidelity Investments is crashing the free-trading party, challenging rivals in a gambit to lure assets by ending commissions.The firm will offer not only zero commissions for online buying and selling of U.S. stocks, exchange-traded funds and options, but also provide higher yields for cash balances and better trade execution, according to an announcement Thursday.The move is the latest leg in the price-chopping frenzy engulfing retail brokerages. Fidelity is the fifth major industry player since last month to roll out some form of zero-commission online stock and ETF trading as companies duel to win investors gravitating toward the cheapest products. Fidelity and its rivals have also been slashing other trading commissions and fees.The Boston-based firm, the largest online brokerage with almost 22 million accounts, boasts in a new ad that retail customers will earn 1.58% on their cash balances automatically swept into a money-market fund, based on yields as of Oct. 8. That tops rates at rivals, the firm said, asserting that customers also save by using Fidelity’s trade execution.“This combination is something that no other firm offers,” Kathleen Murphy, president of the closely held company’s personal investing business, said in the statement.Vanguard Group, a low-cost fund leader, said the firm also sweeps investors’ brokerage account cash balances into higher-yielding money market funds with a low expense ratio. The Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund, for example, yielded 1.9% with an expense ratio of 11 basis points as of Oct. 9. For mutual fund investors with less than $50,000, Vanguard charges $7 for the first 25 online trades and $20 thereafter, according to the firm’s website.Competitors’ MovesThe competition among banks, brokerages and money managers has been intensifying. The investing industry crossed a milestone in August as assets in index mutual funds and ETFs surpassed those in actively run vehicles for the first time, and heavyweights like Charles Schwab Corp., Vanguard and BlackRock Inc. have stepped up the battle for market share.Interactive Brokers Group Inc. announced commission-free trading of U.S.-exchange listed stocks and ETFs in late September. Schwab, TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. and E*Trade Financial Corp. rolled out similar offerings the following week. The announcements of the free service, which threatens the revenue of the brokerages, spurred share declines for the publicly traded companies.Schwab, with more than 12 million brokerage accounts, dropped its commissions from $4.95 per trade, starting Oct. 7. The company had previously matched cuts by Fidelity, reducing its retail trading commissions to $4.95 from $6.95 in February 2017.Index FundsFidelity’s latest move is part of an ongoing shuffle at the firm, which had $2.8 trillion of managed assets as of Aug. 31.The company that built an empire on the prowess of its stock pickers startled the industry last year by offering several zero-fee index mutual funds and has since expanded its slate of commission-free ETFs, giving investors more options with smart beta and active products.Abigail Johnson, the company’s chief executive officer, said in an interview with Bloomberg Markets magazine in November 2018 that offering a series of zero-fee funds and eliminating investment minimums were aimed at allowing the firm to “find other ways for people to give us a try.”(Adds Vanguard comment in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Michael McDonald in Boston at mmcdonald10@bloomberg.net;Melissa Karsh in New York at mkarsh@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Mirabella at amirabella@bloomberg.net, Josh Friedman, Vincent BielskiFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fidelity-joins-price-war-zero-040100483.html?.tsrc=rss

TD Ameritrade has plunged 29% in the past month, while Schwab and E*Trade have both tumbled 13%, as brokers gave up on commissions.“Product pricing is now in-line across e-brokers and Fidelity and removes a near-term overhang,” Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Cyprys wrote in a note. He flagged Fidelity leaving its contract fee on options at 65c per contract, and said, “fears around margin lending going to zero are well overdone.”Cyprys added that Fidelity highlighting its money fund sweep option, which pays a higher yield on customer cash balances than bank sweep offerings at Schwab, TD Ameritrade and E*Trade isn’t new. “They’ve been touting this for a while now, and concerns around this are already reflected in the price for Schwab,” he said.Read more: Schwab, E*Trade Fall as Fidelity Directs Cash to High YieldsFidelity said Thursday it will offer zero commissions for online buying and selling of U.S. stocks, exchange-traded funds and options, and also provide higher yields for cash balances and better trade execution. The move came after four major industry players rolled out commission-free stock and ETF trading:Interactive Brokers Group Inc. announced commission-free stock and ETF trading in late SeptemberSchwab and TD Ameritrade then slashed trading fees to zero on Oct. 1E*Trade joined its rivals and cut commissions to zero the next dayFidelity’s price cut may have other impacts as well, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst David Ritter:“Fidelity’s move to free online trades may spur Schwab to cease accepting payments for order flow (1% of net revenue), likely improving prices received by clients and enhancing its appeal. We think the company is also likely to default to higher interest-bearing options for customers’ cash balances.”Last week, Cyprys said that he saw a higher probability Fidelity would reduce prices after E*Trade, TD Ameritrade and Schwab slashed commissions to zero.Read more: Schwab Triggers Online-Broker Bloodbath as Price War Deepen(Updates share trading in second paragraph.

2019-10-09	2019-10-09 09:00:11	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Central Banks Can't Create Negative Rates by Themselves	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s been a decade since the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and yet here we are in a world where the highest government bond yield starts with the number “2.” Among the world’s major developed economies, only the English speaking countries – the U.S., U.K., Canada, New Zealand and Australia - still have monetary policy rates above zero. But there is more to low yields than monetary policy rates, and those factors are likely to stay in place for an extended period.The following table shows the highest interest rates culled from the 20 largest developed countries from the policy rate to the 30-year bond. Over 200 interest rates were considered and the only one to yield above 2% is the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond at 2.04%. Never has the highest yield among these countries been so low.Start with technology, whose effect has been to make companies more efficient and competitive on prices. So much so that core inflation is considered high if it reaches a 2% rate. Think about how smart phones have reduced the need to buy a separate camera or other devices, websites that make searching for a job or seeking qualified job candidates far more efficient, or the falling price of computing power enabling Charles Schwab Corp., E*Trade Financial Corp., and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. to announce last week that they are eliminating commissions.Core inflation has been low and stable for 15 years and shows no signs of a secular acceleration anytime soon. Low rates of inflation mean interest rates should be in the low single digits. Without a serious return of developed world inflation, which has not been the case for almost 25 years, gone are the days of 4% to 6% yields without a crisis, like the one in Europe’s government debt market around 2012.Next is the global savings glut, a phrase coined by former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2005. As populations age, they have a propensity to save. This is shown by the following chart from the International Monetary Fund. Note that prior to 2005, the global saving rate was never above 24.5%. Since then, it’s only been lower during the panic of 2009. The rate equaled its record high of 26.7% in 2018. This works out to roughly $21 trillion saved every year. Since many seek to match the investments in their savings to their life expectancies, they tend buy bonds. The savings glut is leading to massive bond buying that is resulting in yields dropping below the inflation rate nearly everywhere in the developed world. How unusual is this? As the next chart shows, it is unprecedented in the last quarter century. Only two countries in the developed world have real 10-year yields above zero: Portugal and Italy. Everywhere else, older people are buying bonds and driving yields below the technology-inspired depression in the inflation rate. Demographics tells us the developed world is not running out of old people anytime soon. The savings glut will continue.The two factors above alone should be enough to make investors understand that the fair value for developed world yields now start with a “1” or “0,” but two other factors are driving yields even lower, and into negative territory.One is the global flight-to-quality. As the world economy slows, the natural reaction is to allocate into safe fixed-income securities. Look no further than last week’s reaction to the poor manufacturing data in the U.S. Bonds rallied and equities slid. Yes, flight-to-quality is a cyclical factor that is present when the concern is about a slowing world economy. So, expect this factor to come and go over time. Right now, though, it is “coming.” This flight-to-quality has created to much demand for bonds that the amount of negative yielding debt increased by $8 trillion this year to $14 trillion.Yes, central banks might reverse from their negative interest-rate policies, but that only means developed world rates, without a crisis, will only go up to 1% or maybe 2%. Every future downturn will add back in flight-to-quality buying and negative central bank rates, and down market rates will go again to zero or even lower.The secular outlook has changed and those applying the thinking from previous economic cycles about inflation and real yields conclude these low yields represent a bubble. They are not considering aging populations that are buying bonds and pushing yields below inflation rates driven lower by advances in technology. Add aggressive central banks willing to take monetary policy rates into negative territory and the standard rules that say bubble have not worked for almost a decade. Don’t expect this to change anytime soon.The most commonly asked question from U.S. investors is where they can find yield. Unfortunately, for those still hoping for a previous cycle to return, we have bad news, you have it now at 1%. Embrace it and be lucky U.S. yields are not negative - yet. To contact the author of this story: Jim Bianco at jimb@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Robert Burgess at bburgess@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Jim Bianco is the President and founder of Bianco Research, a provider of data-driven insights into the global economy and financial markets.

2019-10-08	2019-10-08 14:00:02	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Robinhood Gives Banking Another Shot a Year After Botched Launch	(Bloomberg) -- Robinhood Markets Inc. is giving banking another shot, 10 months after its first attempt at a checking and savings product flamed out in spectacular fashion. On Tuesday, the company laid out a new feature, called Cash Management, which takes a more traditional regulatory approach than the startup’s last foray into bank accounts.The service will move customers’ uninvested cash from their Robinhood accounts into existing banks, which are already insured the through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. By working with established players, Robinhood will avoid a hurdle that flummoxed it last time, when it erroneously assumed that the Securities Investor Protection Corp. would cover the insurance on its planned checking product.Robinhood will offer customers a 2.05% interest rate on cash deposited through the program. That’s higher than many traditional banks, but in line with what a number of other financial technology startups currently offer. The product will not be immediately available on Tuesday, but Robinhood will open a waitlist for interested customers.The new product launch comes as competition intensifies around the startup’s core product of free stock trading. Just last week, Charles Schwab Corp. announced plans to eliminate commissions for trading U.S. stocks, exchange traded funds and options. While fees have been on a downward trajectory for some time, Schwab’s decision sent shock waves through the industry, and the move was quickly followed by E*Trade Financial Corp. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.“I think when you look at Schwab and E*Trade and these other brokerage houses, we’ve fundamentally changed the way that a lot of these businesses operate,” said Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt. Now, with Cash Management, Robinhood is looking to diversify its offerings beyond the free trading that roiled the finance world. “This is one of the biggest features that we’re bringing to the Robinhood experience and app in quite a long time,” said Josh Elman, Robinhood’s vice president of product. Today when someone deposits money into a Robinhood account, all they’re able to do with it is trade stocks, cryptocurrencies and other investments, Elman said. With the new product, customers will also be able to earn interest on the money that’s sitting in an account, and make withdrawals or go shopping with a Robinhood debit card.The Cash Management service will be structured as a deposit sweep account, so called because it “sweeps” uninvested money into a separate program. Robinhood will generate revenue from the service through interchange fees via its debit cards, as well as some payments from the banks where it sends customer deposits, the company said.The product is a more modest advancement than the checking service Robinhood announced last year, which promised a virtually unheard-of 3% interest rate. But quickly after Robinhood unveiled its plans, the SIPC said it would likely not insure the product, and appeared taken by surprise at Robinhood’s suggestion that it would. “Had they called us, I would have told them what I just told you in that I have serious concerns about this,’’ Stephen Harbeck, then president and chief executive officer of SIPC, said in an interview at the time. Robinhood bailed on its plans to offer the checking and savings products just one day after announcing them.Last year, “we took the product down almost immediately and hit the reset button,” Bhatt said. But with the launch of Cash Management, “we’ve had a pretty thorough vetting process for this program, and we’ve been working with a lot of external parties,” he said, adding that the company is now working more closely with regulators.On Monday Robinhood announced the addition of a former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission official to its board.To contact the author of this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-gives-banking-another-shot-140002505.html?.tsrc=rss

Subscribe via Pocket Cast or iTunes.Investors pared expectations for future Federal Reserve rate cuts this year after the September jobs report showed the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to a 50-year low.Fed funds futures shows there’s around 17.5 basis points of easing priced in for the central bank’s Oct. 31 meeting. November fed funds futures imply a rate of 1.655% at the end of 2019, having indicated 1.645% just before the release of the data. That’s based on an effective fed funds rate at 1.83% as of Oct. 3.While the U.S. added less jobs than anticipated last month, the market was bracing for a much larger drop after a series of disappointing data, according to TD Securities. Additionally, significant upward revisions to August report and the fall in the unemployment rate is “encouraging,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, the firm’s senior U.S. rates strategist.“It’s a bit of relief for the market following a string of weaker-than-expected data earlier in the week,” Goldberg said. “The market was set up for a lower headline number overall.”Short-dated Treasuries underperformed, with 2-year yields little changed at 1.39% after hitting a 2-year low Thursday. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index traded 0.2% lower, halving daily losses after the release.The jobless rate unexpectedly dropped to 3.5% from 3.7%, the lowest since December 1969. While the U.S. added a below-forecast 145,000 jobs in September, August’s figures were revised to 168,000 from 130,000.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell highlighted the labor market’s strength at an event in Washington on Friday, saying that the U.S. economy is in a “good place.”“It may not be as weak as needed to confirm an October rate cut, but it leaves the door open for it,” said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. “It confirms the slowdown in the economy that has been evident in other reports, but it’s not so weak as to change expectations significantly.”To contact the reporters on this story: Katherine Greifeld in New York at kgreifeld@bloomberg.net;Alexandra Harris in New York at aharris48@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Debarati RoyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/traders-trim-bets-october-fed-123653644.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-03	2019-10-03 15:37:10	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Schwab’s Next Target? Your Financial Adviser	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There’s a showdown looming between financial advisers and the custodians that safeguard their clients’ money. It’s been brewing for some time, and the move by Charles Schwab Corp. on Tuesday to offer commission-free trading makes the clash all but inevitable.Retail investors know Schwab as a discount broker, but it’s also a custodian for financial advisers who break away from banks, insurance companies and other financial firms, or set up shop on their own. Those advisers need someone to house client accounts and execute trades, and firms such as Schwab, Fidelity Investments, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. are popular choices. (My asset-management firm works with Schwab and TD Ameritrade.)It was a blissful union. Clients paid financial advisers a fee for constructing portfolios and financial planning, typically a percentage of assets under management, and custodians collected interest on clients’ cash and margin, distribution fees from mutual funds and, of course, commissions on trades. Lately, though, the relationship between advisers and custodians has become strained. While advisers continue to collect their fees, custodians are increasingly under pressure.Roughly 40% of Schwab’s revenue last year came from proprietary mutual funds and ETFs, third-party mutual funds, commissions and – importantly – advisory fees. The value of all but the latter is now zero or trending in that direction. The other 60% of Schwab’s revenue, which is interest income primarily from margin loans, bank loans and fixed-income investments, isn’t likely to make up the difference. Schwab can only boost interest revenue by gathering more assets or praying for higher interest rates. Few expect rates to rise any time soon, and Schwab’s competitors are now offering free trades of their own, so there’s little reason for investors to flock to the broker. TD Ameritrade announced it will cut its commissions to zero mere hours after Schwab, and E*Trade Financial Corp. followed on Wednesday. The market reaction? Investors have roundly hammered discount brokers: As custodian-brokers raced to the bottom on fund fees and commissions, advisory fees have remained remarkably resilient. The average financial adviser continues to collect roughly 1% a year on accounts of $1 million, and more for smaller accounts. Industry observer and financial adviser Michael Kitces isn’t surprised. “When price competition breaks out, whoever is closest to the client wins,” he says. That’s why advisers have been able to maintain their fees even as trading commissions and expense ratios for mutual funds and ETFs have plunged, in part due to advisers’ growing preference for low-cost funds.It may also explain why investors are sticking with advisers despite growing competition from automated investing platforms that typically charge lower advisory fees, and in Schwab’s case, no fee (although Schwab makes money on its robo-adviser through proprietary ETFs and interest on cash balances). Investors may eventually feel comfortable handing their money to the bots, but most still seem to value proximity to human advisers.The predictable result is that custodians, and even some mutual fund companies, are keen on getting closer to clients. Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard Group have all made a big push into the advisory business in recent years. While hard numbers are hard to track down, Kitces estimates that those firms now account for “a material slice of the overall market for financial advice and a huge portion of the cumulative growth of advisory assets over the last four years.”Custodians are likely to win. They have the expertise to navigate the dizzying array of mutual funds and ETFs sold to investors, plus the size and reach to undercut advisers’ fees and the resources to build technology advisers can only dream about. That doesn’t mean independent financial advisers will disappear, but many won’t survive the onslaught, and those who do can expect a pay cut. WealthManagement.com, a media and marketing outlet catering to financial advisers and wealth professionals, took a flash poll of advisers on Tuesday and concluded that many are skeptical of free commissions and question how Schwab and others will make up the lost revenue. “There’s no free lunch, after all,” it reminded readers.One adviser summed it up, saying he’s “looking for the catch.” Well, here it is: When the dust settles, financial advisers won’t be eating lunch – they’ll be on the menu.To contact the author of this story: Nir Kaissar at nkaissar1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nir Kaissar is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the markets.

2019-10-02	2019-10-02 20:28:22	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	E*Trade Joins Rivals by Ending Commissions in Race to the Bottom	(Bloomberg) -- E*Trade Financial Corp. cut trading commissions to zero, joining major rivals in the race to the bottom and setting the stage for mergers among discount brokerages.The end to commissions on U.S. listed stock, ETFs and options trades will go into effect Oct. 7, New York-based E*Trade said in a release Wednesday. Its options contract charge will be cut to 65 cents per contract for all traders. E*Trade estimates a loss of approximately $300 million per year in revenue from the drop in commissions.The move shows the intensifying competition to lure retail investors who gravitate toward the cheapest offerings. Interactive Brokers Group Inc. in late September announced commission-free trading of U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds on its IBKR Lite platform. Charles Schwab Corp. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. also slashed trading fees to zero on Tuesday. The Schwab announcement sent the shares of all the brokerages plummeting.Shares of TD Ameritrade extended their 3.3% decline in after-hours trading Wednesday.Since Interactive Brokers announced its commission-free offering, TD Ameritrade shares have fared the worst, losing nearly one-third of their value. E*Trade shares dropped about 20% in the period. Schwab is down about 13% and Interactive Brokers about 9%.E*Trade was an early disruptor in stock trading, offering retail investors a way to trade online. Amid heightened competition, the company has found itself searching for a way forward, making management changes, and reviewing its business. E*Trade named Michael Pizzi its chief executive officer in August, fueling analyst speculation that the company might be assessing strategic options like a sale.Possible MergerAnalysts have long pointed to TD Ameritrade as a prospective buyer of E*Trade, which is the smallest by market share of the top online brokers.San Francisco-based Schwab, with about $3.7 trillion of client assets, gets a majority of its revenue from net interest income. Its decision to eliminate trading commissions may be coming at a perilous time as interest rates remain historically low. In September, the brokerage said it was cutting 600 jobs, or about 3% of its workforce, citing “an increasingly challenging economic environment.”The company last cut its retail trading commissions to $4.95 from $6.95 in February 2017, matching cuts by Fidelity. Since then, assets at the firm have grown by about $800 billion from a combination of market gains and net new inflows.Source: company filingsSchwab can make up for lost revenue by offering advice to clients approaching retirement, said Alois Pirker, Aite Group’s research director for wealth management.Ameritrade shares took the biggest hit, tumbling the most since 1999, after Schwab’s move on Oct. 1. Ameritrade is more exposed than its closest rivals because the company gets more than a third of its revenue from commissions in fees, said David Ritter, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.The shift to free commissions may prompt Ameritrade and E*Trade to reconsider a merger, Ritter said. The combination would put the brokerages in a better position to compete with Schwab.The fee war has rattled the broader asset management industry as well. Since the middle of last year, firms including Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have eliminated fees and commissions on a range of offerings.(Updates with E*Trade CEO details in 7th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Josh Friedman.To contact the reporter on this story: Annie Massa in New York at amassa12@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Mirabella at amirabella@bloomberg.net, Vincent Bielski, Melissa KarshFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/e-trade-joins-rivals-ending-200504093.html?.tsrc=rss

Schwab's stock also tumbled on Tuesday, falling 9.7%, marking its worst single-session decline since June 24, 2016, while shares of E-Trade Financial Corp.  dropped 16.4%, representing its worst fall since 2009 and Interactive Brokers Group Inc.'s [IBKR] stock gave up 9.4%, also for its worst one-day drop in a decade. &quot;We've been taking market share with a premium price point, and with a $0 price point and a level playing field, we are even more confident in our competitive position, and the value we offer our clients,&quot; said Tim Hockey, president and chief executive officer of TD Ameritrade in a statement on Tuesday. Declines for the online brokers also came as the Dow Jones Industrial Average  and the S&P 500  suffered their worst daily losses since Aug. 23, following a disappointing survey on manufacturing that revived worries about a domestic recession.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/633b5d4e-a361-32b1-a049-0e761ac50d1a/td-ameritrade-joins-race-to.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-10-02	2019-10-02 10:00:00	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	With $0 Fees, Schwab Risks Blowing Up Brokerage Model It Built	(Bloomberg) -- Not too long ago, Charles Schwab Corp. helped to usher in the golden age of low-cost, online stock trading.Now, the brokerage may help to kill off the fee-based business model altogether.On Tuesday, Schwab said it will eliminate commissions on trades for all U.S. stocks and exchange traded funds. The announcement -- which was quickly matched by rival TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. after markets closed -- sent shock waves across Wall Street. Shares of E*Trade Financial Corp. slumped 16%, while TD Ameritrade lost more than a quarter of its stock market value. Schwab’s share price also took a hit, tumbling nearly 10%.The gambit is just the latest in an intensifying, industry-wide war over fees for everything from stock trades to index funds and financial advice. And it’s squeezing not only the likes of Schwab, but also BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments. These types of aggressive price cuts -- admittedly a small boon for ordinary Americans routinely nickel-and-dimed by financial firms -- have some observers wondering whether anyone can win in a business where more and more services are handed out for free.For Schwab, it’s a bold, but risky move. The firm, which relies less on trading commissions than its competitors, is betting it can offset any decline of revenue by attracting more clients. It can then use their assets to generate interest income, an essential feature of its business that’s come under pressure recently as interest rates have declined.“Maybe because of the inception and growth spurt of online brokers during the dot-com boom, there’s a romanticization of the individual trader,” said Michael Wong, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. “There’s still a mindset among the investing public around the importance of commissions,” which is less important to Schwab.While trading costs have declined across the board, Schwab comes from a position of relative strength. The firm takes in just 7% of its net revenue from commissions. That’s far less than Interactive Brokers Group Inc. or TD Ameritrade, which both collect more than a third from trading fees.Schwab estimated it could lose up to $400 million in revenue a year from its zero-fee offering. Wong said that in the current rate environment, the firm would need roughly $20 billion or more in new deposits to offset that loss. Currently, over half of Schwab’s net revenue comes from interest earned on its assets. The firm, which oversaw $3.72 trillion as of Aug. 31, took in almost $20 billion in net new assets that month.Schwab last cut its trading commissions in February 2017, when it reduced them to $4.95 per trade from $6.95 to match Fidelity. Since then, assets at the firm have grown by about $800 billion from a combination of market gains and net new inflows.Nevertheless, the company is looking for ways to reduce costs internally. Last month, Schwab said it would cut 600 jobs, or about 3% of its workforce, because of the “increasingly challenging economic environment.”Its latest move builds on an increasingly aggressive, slash-and-burn approach to price reductions. Late Tuesday, TD Ameritrade said it would match Schwab’s no-fee trading offer at a cost of as much as $240 million a quarter, or roughly 16% of its net revenue. Interactive Brokers announced just last week that it would provide free trades. And in recent months, Fidelity, Vanguard Group and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have all taken steps to eliminate fees and commissions on some offerings.According to Schwab Chief Financial Officer Peter Crawford, zero commissions are an inevitable industry trend. Schwab is just trying to get ahead of that.“We are seeing new firms trying to enter our market -- using zero or low equity commissions as a lever,” Crawford wrote. “We’re not feeling competitive pressure from these firms ... yet. But we don’t want to fall into the trap that a myriad of other firms in a variety of industries have fallen into and wait too long to respond to new entrants. It has seemed inevitable that commissions would head towards zero, so why wait?’The developments show just how online stock trading is becoming a commoditized business. As a result, Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, says brokerages will need to use their platforms to generate revenue from other services. Those include securities lending, charging asset managers fees to offer their funds, and advisory services.“They have to give a lot away for free to charge for parts of their platform that are less commoditized,” Ryan said. Firms like TD Ameritrade might start charging subscription fees for access to data, options and margin accounts.It’s not just brokerages that are facing pressure to cut prices. Fund managers like BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Corp. have also been forced to reduce the fees they charge, particularly for index-tracking funds. On the day that Fidelity announced it would offer several free index mutual funds last year, shares of other asset managers took a hit.While the splashy introduction of a free product may attract a lot of customer attention, it could also backfire, according to Dan Ariely, a behavioral economics professor at Duke University.“The odds are that what people will do is to say, ‘Schwab is offering these services for free, and so they can offer everything for free,”’ he said. The risk is that “when Schwab tries to get these same consumers to do something that costs money, they may say, ‘No thanks.’”&#92;--With assistance from Suzanne Woolley.To contact the reporters on this story: Annie Massa in New York at amassa12@bloomberg.net;John Gittelsohn in Los Angeles at johngitt@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Mirabella at amirabella@bloomberg.net, Michael Tsang, Vincent BielskiFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/0-fees-schwab-risks-blowing-230000624.html?.tsrc=rss

E*Trade Financial Corp. dropped 16%, the most in more than a decade. Shares of Interactive Brokers Group Inc. and Schwab both slid more than 9%.The move escalates a long-simmering price war as investors gravitate toward the cheapest products, with Interactive Brokers announcing just last week that it would provide free trades. Since the middle of last year, firms including Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have eliminated fees and commissions on a range of offerings.See also: JPMorgan offers free trades in escalating fight for retail“They’ll have to follow suit,” Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones, said of Schwab’s competitors. “It’s a commoditized business. When there’s an announcement by one firm, others play catch-up or take a more aggressive strategy.”Schwab’s online clients will qualify for zero commissions, down from $4.95 per trade, starting Oct. 7, the firm said in a statement. It will continue to charge a fee of 65 cents per contract for options trades.Double-WhammyAmeritrade is more exposed than its closest rivals because the company gets more than a third of its revenue from commissions in fees, said David Ritter, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.“It’s a double-whammy for them,” he said. “For the biggest of the big like Schwab, they’re best able to absorb and monetize in other ways.”While the San Francisco-based company, with about $3.75 trillion of client assets, gets a majority of its revenue from net interest income, its decision to eliminate commissions comes at a perilous time because of historically low interest rates. Last month, the brokerage said it was cutting 600 jobs, or about 3% of its workforce, citing “an increasingly challenging economic environment.”Read more: Schwab to cut 600 jobs as falling rates crimp interest incomeSchwab’s move also may prompt Ameritrade and E*Trade to reconsider a merger, Ritter said.Schwab previously doubled its suite of no-commission ETFs in March, bringing its total to more than 500 at the time. BlackRock Inc. iShares products were added to its platform, Schwab ETF OneSource, with 90 funds. Several fund issuers including State Street Global Advisors, Invesco Ltd., WisdomTree Investments Inc., J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Pacific Investment Management Co. also planned to add to their commission-free offerings already on the platform.The cut to zero commissions is an inevitable industry trend that Schwab is trying to get ahead of, its Chief Financial Officer Peter Crawford said in a separate statement Tuesday.“We are seeing new firms trying to enter our market -- using zero or low equity commissions as a lever,” Crawford said. “It has seemed inevitable that commissions would head towards zero, so why wait.”Robo-AdviceThe company last cut its retail trading commissions to $4.95 from $6.95 in February 2017, matching cuts by Fidelity. Since then, assets at the firm have grown by about $800 billion from a combination of market gains and net new inflows.The brokerage can make up for lost revenue by offering advice to clients approaching retirement, said Alois Pirker, Aite Group’s research director for wealth management.“They’re looking at their client base and saying, ‘what do our clients need right now?’ They need advice and they need portfolios,” Pirker said.Schwab has a range of advice offerings, from a free basic robo-advice platform to dedicated financial advisers, whose fees can start at 0.8% of assets per year.For Schwab, offering free trades is the ultimate extension of its roots in the 1970s as a discount broker.“Eliminating commissions ensures my ultimate vision is realized -- making investing accessible to all,” Schwab’s billionaire founder and Chairman Charles Schwab said in the statement.(Updates share prices in second paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Emma Vickers, Ben Steverman and Peter Eichenbaum.To contact the reporters on this story: John Gittelsohn in Los Angeles at johngitt@bloomberg.net;Annie Massa in New York at amassa12@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Mirabella at amirabella@bloomberg.net, ;Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Vincent Bielski, Melissa KarshFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-drop-online-stock-142058666.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-01	2019-10-01 13:51:25	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Charles Schwab to Drop Online Stock, ETF Fees in Price War	(Bloomberg) -- Charles Schwab Corp., in an escalating price war with rivals, plans to reduce U.S. stock, exchange traded funds and options online trade commissions. Shares fell the most in three years.Schwab clients using its web and mobile channels qualify for the new pricing from $4.95 to zero, which begins Oct. 7, according to a statement from the company Tuesday. They don’t have to open an account, make a new deposit or maintain a minimum balance. Clients trading options will continue to pay 65 cents per contract.Schwab’s move is the latest in a price war with competitors as investors flock to the cheapest products. Vanguard Group last year announced it would offer almost 1,800 ETFs commission-free on its platform. Almost every Vanguard ETF can now be traded without cost on the firm’s platform. In June, Fidelity Investments also expanded its lineup of commission-free ETFs.Last week, Interactive Brokers Group Inc. announced it also would offer free trades.“Since Schwab is the market leader, this is a significant development and will likely force peers to reduce their own commission rates,” Christopher Harris, an analyst with Wells Fargo & Co., said in a note Tuesday.The price cuts are more likely to hurt revenue at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. and E*Trade Financial Corp, which depend more heavily than Schwab on brokerage fees, Craig Siegenthaler, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group, said in a note Tuesday.Shares of Schwab fell about 9% to $38.09 at 9:50 am . Shares of Interactive Brokers Group also slipped on the news.(Updates with analyst comments in fifth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: John Gittelsohn in Los Angeles at johngitt@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Mirabella at amirabella@bloomberg.net, Vincent Bielski, Melissa KarshFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-end-online-stock-132203808.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-11	2019-09-11 01:50:40	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Schwab to Cut 600 Jobs on ‘Challenging’ Economic Climate	(Bloomberg) -- Charles Schwab Corp. said it is cutting 600 jobs, or about 3% of the workforce, as the San Francisco-based broker-dealer and wealth-advisory firm faces “an increasingly challenging economic environment.”“These actions are a prudent step to ensure we manage our expense growth while continuing to invest in initiatives that allow us to achieve greater scale and efficiency,” the firm said Tuesday in a statement. “Impacted positions span all staffing grades, as well as organizations and locations across the company.”Schwab, with about $3.75 trillion in client assets, derives the majority of its revenue from net interest on client cash, which has been squeezed by falling interest rates. The firm began to review its expenses this spring, according to the statement.Falling rates and narrower net interest income have spurred banks including Wells Fargo & Co. to cut earnings outlooks. Asset managers including Legg Mason Inc., BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. announced staff reductions this year as they spend more on technology and face unprecedented pressure to reduce fees.Schwab, which has been on the front lines of the fee-cutting war, has been pushing more deeply into advisory services. It agreed in July to pay $1.8 billion for the wealth management operations of USAA, the insurance company that serves military veterans and service members.The Wall Street Journal reported the job cuts earlier.(Adds information on other industry issues starting in fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: John Gittelsohn in Los Angeles at johngitt@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Mirabella at amirabella@bloomberg.net, Josh Friedman, Dan ReichlFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-cut-600-jobs-challenging-015040235.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-06	2019-09-06 18:01:00	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Should Investors Buy Bank of America Stock?	Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) investor position indicator recently fell below 2.0 for the first time since January. As a result, BofA market strategist Michael Hartnett hinted that investors should consider buying risk assets such as BAC stock.Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBefore you get mad at me for stretching the truth, here's what Hartnett actually said:&quot;The bank's investor position indicator, which tracks 18 measurements on asset flow, sentiment, and price, is falling below 2.0 for the first time since January--a level that signals that investor positions are extremely bearish and triggers a contrarian buy signal for risk assets.&quot;  * 7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Strong U.S. Economy He did not recommend buying BAC stock. However, trading at  1.o5 times its book value,  the BAC stock price certainly is attractive relative to some of its peers. Is that enough to make BAC stock a buy?Here are my arguments for and against buying Bank of America stock. The Argument for Buying BAC StockAs I stated above, Bank of America's price/book ratio is pretty darn low. According to a list of the 15 largest U.S. banks by total assets, the average P/B of the 14 banks not named Bank of America is 1.24, approximately 18% higher than BAC. So, on that front, BAC stock is cheaper than its peers. However, there are some outliers. For example, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) is the 12th-largest U.S. bank with $283 billion in assets. It has a P/B of 2.68 due to its wealth management and brokerage businesses. Excluding Schwab, the average P/B drops to 1.13, 7.5% higher than BAC.More importantly, compared to the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which trades at 1.53 times book, BAC stock provides better value. It also can't hurt to mention that BAC stock is Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) largest bank holding. Berkshire owns $26.0 billion of BAC stock, representing 12.5% of the holding company's equity portfolio. If you believe in Warren Buffett, that speaks volumes about BAC.     The Argument Against Buying Bank of America StockBetween the trade war, which is hurting a wide swath of U.S. companies and the recent interest-rate cut which lowered the amount banks make from their loans, banking stocks are cheap for a reason. And although Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell has said further interest rate cuts are unlikely, if the trade war continues well into 2020, the Fed will definitely reconsider its stance.Quite simply, banks' earnings are currently under pressure and will remain so for the foreseeable future. That makes all bank stocks less attractive.  Interestingly, despite the fact that all bank stocks are being hurt by the current economic climate, BAC was the only major bank stock to be downgraded by Raymond James analyst Michael Rose last week. Rose cut Bank of America stock from &quot;outperform&quot; to &quot;market perform,&quot; due to the bank's inability to generate positive operating leverage in 2020. InvestorPlace writer James Brumley recently referenced Rose's comments about BAC in his article about the bank.&quot;We now see its greater than peer asset sensitivity positing a greater challenge to net interest income given further flattening of the yield curve and the potential for several additional rate cuts from here,&quot; Rose stated. Brumley further noted that the bank has an unusually large amount of non-interest-bearing deposits that help it during periods of rising interest rates but hurt it when interest rates are falling. BAC 's non-interest-bearing deposits  account for 23% of its total funding sources.  BAC stock has risen more than most of its peers as a result of the possibility of higher interest rates. However, now that this has been thrown into question, Bank of America stock doesn't have nearly the momentum it did a year ago.    The Bottom Line on BAC StockI would wait until the trade war is settled and the direction of the U.S. economy is better understood before buying BAC stock.For those who don't want to wait, I see JPMorgan as the best of the major U.S. banks At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

During a tweetstorm, President Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.Source: Shutterstock Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.07%, and S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.18%. Nasdaq-100 futures have shed 0.56%.Yesterday's surprise Trump Tweet sent the options pits into a tizzy. Trade volumes exploded with puts slightly outpacing calls. By day's end, about 24.7 million calls and 25 million puts had changed hands.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe fear fest was enough to send the CBOE single-session equity put/call volume ratio to 0.75 -- a two-month high. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average bumped up to 0.67.Options activity was hot in Chinese stocks, banks and companies with earnings last night. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and Square (NYSE:SQ) all found themselves atop the most-active options leaderboard.Let's take a closer look: Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW)Yesterday's escalation in the trade war sparked a widespread flight to safety. Stocks died while bonds and gold flew. The ramp in bond prices sent interest rates plunging. By day's end, the 10-year yield had fallen to a two-and-a-half-year low at 1.87%.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond With banks being one of the more sensitive industries to interest rate movements, it should come as no surprise that the financial sector was one of the hardest-hit areas Thursday. Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) fell 4.5% on huge volume. With its price now below the 200-day, 50-day and 20-day moving averages, sellers have wrested control of the trend across all time frames.On the options trading front, demand was shared equally among calls and puts. Activity rocketed to 847% of the average daily volume, with 167,784 total contracts traded. Calls claimed 52% of the session's sum.The increased demand drove implied volatility to 29% or the 25th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of 75 cents or 1.8%. Square (SQ)While the broader market had the Fed and a trade war to wrestle with, Square was gearing up for last night's quarterly report. SQ stock was able to end the day up slightly but is falling 10% after hours to $73. It faces a test of its 50-day moving average at the open. Time will tell if buyers rise to the occasion and buy the dip or let further follow-through throw a wrench into its once robust uptrend.For the second quarter, Square saw revenue of $563 million, which is a 46% jump over the year-ago period. That translated into a net profit of just over $100 million or 21 cents per share. Both measures bested analyst estimates, but the Street was not happy with Square's guidance for the third quarter. The company expects profits in the 18 to 20 cents range, and analysts were aiming for 22 cents.On the options trading front, traders favored calls ahead of the event. Total activity popped to 276% of the average daily volume, with 170,478 contracts traded; 61% of the trading came from call options alone.The options board was pricing in a $5.25 or 6.4% gap after earnings. That means this morning's 10% whack falls well outside of expectations and should bring solid profits to traders swinging long volatility trades into the event. Alibaba (BABA)Given the catalyst for yesterday's beatdown, it should come as no surprise that Chinese stocks were particularly hard hit. Alibaba shares were rocked 4.3%, slicing below multiple moving averages in the process. Its price trend is now one banana peel away from reversing into a downtrend.  * 7 Charts That Should Concern Marijuana Stock Investors A close below $165 will seal the deal, and signal bears are back in town. The volatility surge comes as traders are prepping for the company's next earnings release on Aug. 15.On the options trading front, calls led the way despite the day's thrashing. Activity swelled to 208% of the average daily volume, with 310,204 total contracts traded. Calls accounted for 59% of the day's take.Implied volatility zoomed to 39%, placing it at the 39th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of $4.09 or 2.5%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But with global bond ETFs surpassing $1 trillion this year, debt funds are increasingly important for further growth.The firm is keen to fill “gaps” in its fixed-income lineup, CSIM’s Jonathan de St. Paer said earlier this year before taking over as chief executive in April.The planned funds and their trading tickers are:Schwab Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF (SCHJ)Schwab Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (SCHI)Schwab Long-Term U.S. Treasury ETF (SCHQ)The firm didn’t disclose the intended management fees.To contact the reporter on this story: Rachel Evans in New York at revans43@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Brendan WalshFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-tackles-gaps-bond-etf-174049736.html?.tsrc=rss

In place of next year’s trip to Hawaii for about 200 employees, the company will give those making the Chairman’s Club an after-tax check for $5,000 and a paid week off.  Ending the Hawaii trip reflects how no expense is overlooked in an era when Schwab faces pricing pressures from a new generation of competitors, such as Menlo Park-based Robinhood, with commission-free stock trades and margin rates on most loans about half of what Schwab charges.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a6e83da1-37b5-362d-92e1-45a972ac9f54/charles-schwab-dumps-hawaii.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-07-15	2019-07-15 20:29:31	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Schwab in Talks to Buy USAA Units to Diversify, WSJ Reports	(Bloomberg) -- Charles Schwab Corp. appears to be making a play to grab more advisory clients as fees fall for asset management and trading.The San Francisco-based brokerage firm is in talks to buy USAA’s brokerage and wealth-management operations for roughly $2 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. The deal may be reached this month, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter.The potential transaction underscores the increasing race by asset managers to diversify amid competition to lower fees for trading and fund management. In March, Schwab introduced the first monthly subscription plan for clients. Vanguard Group Inc., the low-fee fund leader, is devoting more resources to offering advice and Fidelity Investments last year started offering zero-fee index funds.“We’ve seen Schwab in general moving more in the direction of providing wealth-management and financial planning advice, more than just the DIY-investor platform,” Donnie Ethier, director of wealth management at Boston-based consulting firm Cerulli Associates, said. USAA’s clientele represent current and former members of the military who “tend to have a very strong culture and client loyalty and retention.”Traditionally viewed as an adviser and broker to the masses, Schwab’s USAA deal would fuel expansion in an arena that’s seen as having better growth prospects and a higher return on equity than most other retail banking businesses.In North America, personal financial wealth grew by nearly a quarter in the three years ending in 2018 to $90.3 trillion, according to a Boston Consulting Group report. Baby boomers are becoming increasingly dependent on money managers as they retire at a pace of 10,000 a day.The advisory business is undergoing a sea-change as financial technology, such as robo-advisers and index funds, are transforming client needs and expectations, according Ethier, who has no direct knowledge of the potential transaction.Representatives for Schwab and USAA declined to comment when reached by Bloomberg.Schwab has been trying to increase the share of revenue and income from adviser services, which made up 27.7% of revenue and 30.4% of operating income for fiscal 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The majority of Schwab’s revenue last year came from net interest margin, or earnings from client cash deposits, a source that would be threatened by falling interest rates.The potential transaction got a lukewarm reception from investors and some analysts.USAA would add about 3% to Schwab’s total of $3.6 trillion in client assets, so “clearly not qualify as a transformative deal although is not insignificant,” Wells Fargo & Co. analysts led by Christopher Harris said in a note Monday.Schwab shares climbed 0.4% to $40.30 in New York trading Monday. The stock has declined 3% this year, while an S&P 500 index of asset managers and custody banks returned 11%.On July 12, Bank of America Corp. cut its Schwab rating to neutral from buy, citing a tougher revenue and margin outlook.The company reports earnings tomorrow and will hold a business update call July 19.The sale of its wealth management unit would help USAA focus more on its core insurance business, according to Cerulli’s Ethier. On July 1, it completed the sale of its asset management business to Victory Capital Holdings Inc. for $850 million.(Adds analyst comments starting in fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: John Gittelsohn in Los Angeles at johngitt@bloomberg.net;Devon Pendleton in New York at dpendleton@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Mirabella at amirabella@bloomberg.net, ;Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Josh FriedmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-talks-buy-usaa-wealth-184053543.html?.tsrc=rss

Such a move has the potential of bringing in about $100 billion worth of assets to the firm from the closely-held USAA.The deal could be ironed out and carried to fruition as soon as the current month, according to people familiar with the matter. Such an agreement would mark a continuation of Charles Schwab's March decision to roll out a new subscription model that would reel in more clients in the wealth management space-it would do so by making such advice more affordable when compared to the traditional way of charging a percentage of the assets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe California-based firm also has its hand in the spaces of banking and custodial services, which has helped it attain a market value of roughly $55 billion, per the Wall Street Journal.

2019-07-12	2019-07-12 14:10:00	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Charles Schwab's stock falls after BofA Merrill Lynch downgrades on revenue headwinds from rate cuts	Shares of Charles Schwab Corp.  fell 1.1% in morning trading Friday, enough to pace the S&P 500's financial-sector decliners, after BofA Merrill Lynch downgraded the discount broker, citing a tougher revenue and margin outlook given expectations that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates. Analyst Michael Carrier cut his rating to neutral from buy, and dropped his stock price target to $43 from $49. Carrier said Schwab's revenue engine over the past few years has been net interest margin (NII), which would decline if the Fed lowers its target on overnight interest rates, as is widely expected. &quot;While we believe some of this risk is priced into the shares at the current valuation, we see more downside risk to estimates ahead,&quot; Carrier wrote in a note to clients. The stock has shed 12% over the past three months, while the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF  has gained 3.7% and the S&P 500  has tacked on 3.4%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1b8b17be-7fbd-3315-ae9a-6106caf7f378/charles-schwab%26%2339%3Bs-stock.html?.tsrc=rss

Shares of E-Trade Financial Corp.  lost 1.3%, putting them on track for the lowest close since Jan. 2; TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.  fell 0.3% toward the lowest close since Dec. 24; and Charles Schwab Corp.  edged up 0.1%, but had fallen as much as 2.1% earlier to the lowest intraday price seen since Dec. 26. O&apos;Shaughnessy cut his price target for E-Trade&apos;s stock to $57 from $60, for TD Ameritrade to $60 from $62 and for Schwab to $46 from $51. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 3.6 basis points to 1.985%, which would be the first close below the 2.00% mark since Nov. 8, 2016. O&apos;Shaughnessy said a lower interest rate environment weighs on net interest income. In addition, he said the continued decline in the yield curve, with the 10-year Treasury yield now below overnight rates, is likely weighing on securities re-investment yield for online brokers. Meanwhile, the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF  slipped 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 31 points, or 0.1%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e7a81053-c8bf-3e2f-85b2-2d16a68596c3/online-broker-stocks-fall.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-17	2019-06-17 12:29:32	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	3 Big Stock Charts for Monday: Centurylink, Allergan and Charles Schwab	Another day of indecision. The market is at least holding its ground above a key technical floor, even though the S&P 500 lost 0.18% of its value on Friday. It even logged a gain for the week. But, it's clear investors remain hesitant.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)The bulls weren't hesitant about Sprint (NYSE:S), pushing it up nearly 3% on renewed optimism the Federal Trade Commission could give its impending merger with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) a green light as early as next week after all. A much-ballyhooed Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) jumped more than 7% on news that its primary rival, Impossible Burger, was struggling to meet demand for its product.There just weren't enough names like Beyond Meat and Sprint to overcome dead weight like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). AMD shares fell more than 3% after rival Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) lowered its full-year guidance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today None of those names make for great trading prospects today, however … too much unpredictable volatility. Rather, it's the stock charts of Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), Allergan (NYSE:AGN) and Centurylink (NYSE:CTL) that are worth closer looks. Here's why. Centurylink (CTL)We've seen fakeout moves from Centurylink shares before, so take this one with a grain of salt. But, this one is different in the sense that it's starting to take hold after a major selloff that has left the stock oversold and ripe for a rebound. There's just one more hurdle to clear, though it's not a small one. It has proven to be a ceiling in the past, though in slightly different circumstances.  Click to Enlarge  * The slow break above the falling resistance level marked in yellow on both stock charts ultimately petered out, but the break above the falling ceiling plotted with blue lines since April seems to be taking shape at a much stronger pace.  * This time around the rebound move is materializing after the weekly chart's RSI indicator fell well into oversold territory. The move out of that condition in the meantime is a sign that a reversal is underway.  * The key from here is a move above the purple 50-day moving average line. That level was a ceiling a couple of times in the fall of last year, but that was when the selloff was just getting started. It really is a different scenario now. Allergan (AGN)Long-term Allergan shareholders are no stranger to disappointment. The stock has been in a choppy downtrend since 2015, managing to reach new multi-year lows on Friday of last week. It looks and feels like the stock is about to implode.And, maybe it is. But, with Friday's 4.1% meltdown, AGN stock has actually bumped into a very well-established technical floor that could throw bears for a loop. Although some sort of verification is necessary before jumping to any conclusions, the binary outcome that has to take shape from here is apt to offer some significant swing trading opportunities no matter what.  * 10 High-Yield Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy   Click to Enlarge  * As of Friday, Allergen shares are kissing the lower edge of a converging wedge pattern that extends back to 2015.  * The bullish case is simple enough -- at a major floor and with the weekly chart's RSI indicator almost into oversold territory, another rebound could be imminent. The bulls will have to confirm that's going to happen with a bounce this week.  * It's not a very well watched dynamic, but thanks to Friday's tumble, AGN shares are now 25% below their white 200-day moving average line. That was about the maximum divergence allowed to take shape in late 2017 and early 2018, also bolstering the bullish case. Charles Schwab (SCHW)A month ago, Charles Schwab shares were toying with a recovery move. Although a falling resistance line was still intact, a handful of other bullish clues were materializing.The effort never panned out. Instead, SCHW bumped into that technical ceiling one last time, fell back again and then continued to fall. The last bastion of hope was wiped away on Friday with a 3.1% setback that dragged Charles Schwab shares back to their lowest level in months. And, that's not even the worst of it.  Click to Enlarge  * The resistance line that remains intact is plotted in blue on both stock charts, tagging all the key highs since November.  * Support was developing around $41.40, by virtue of shares making a couple of major lows there since March. That floor was smashed on Friday.  * Although anything is still possible at this point, with a floor now taken out of the picture, the next most likely landing spot is the most frequent low seen since early 2017. That floor near $37.80 is marked in yellow on both stock charts.  * From the perspective of the weekly chart, the pattern since early 2017 loosely looks like a head-and-shoulders pattern. Should the &quot;neckline&quot; at $37.80 also fail, the ensuing selloff could be significant.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Though Ford lacks the large Mexican presence of its archrival GM (NYSE:GM), concerns about supply chains rattled investors in Ford stock and its peers.Source: Jens Mayer via Flickr (Modified)While this selloff will probably become a buying opportunity, traders should hold off in the near-term as the impact becomes fully understood. Tariffs Could Directly Affect Electric Car ProductionIn an unexpected move, President Trump slapped a 5% tariff on all goods coming from Mexico. Tariffs will begin on June 10 and will gradually increase until Mexico has done enough in the eyes of the Trump Administration to curb illegal immigration. News of these duties sent the market sharply lower, hitting Ford stock and auto stocks across the board.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Heavily Shorted Stocks to Sell -- Because the Bears Are Right For the first four months of 2019, Ford produced 20,234 vehicles in Mexico. This represents a 14.7% decline in Mexican production from the same quarter last year. That also makes up only a small percentage of production as Ford sold 590,249 vehicles in North America in the first three months of the year.Nonetheless, this could cause issues for Ford stock as the company had expected to produce more cars in Mexico, even as it cut overall production. The company has planned to build its battery-electric crossover vehicle at its Cuautitlan, Mexico plant. This means a change from its original plan to produce the car at its Flat Rock, Michigan facility.Moreover, Ford has lagged both long-time rivals and upstarts such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nio (NYSE:NIO) in electric vehicle production. Now, with that production happening in a country directly targeted by tariffs, worries become magnified. Most of the Concern Involves the Supply ChainHowever, the more significant concern might come from integrated supply chains. According to Liz Ann Sanders of Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), two-thirds of the imports between the U.S. and Mexico take place intra-company. Goods can also cross the border multiple times. Country wide, the Wilson Center says that 4.9 million U.S. jobs and more than $500 billion in economic activity depend on trade with Mexico.From an investor standpoint, traders now have to wonder if Ford stock can continue to recover as many had predicted. Even after the Friday swoon, Ford stock has risen by more than 25% since late December. However, that comes after the F stock lost nearly half of its value over a five-year period. That brought its multiple to just under seven times forward earnings. Given that low P/E ratio, I see it retesting the December lows only in a worst case scenario. Still, supply chain concerns may limit the upside for now.In the meantime, long-time holders of Ford stock can take solace in the dividend. The Ford stock price has fallen back below $9.50 per share. With the annual payout currently at 60 cents per share, this takes the yield to around 6.4%. Yes, it fell from last year's 73 cents per share. However, with the yield at more than triple the S&P 500 average, that still can bring investors substantial cash flows. The Bottom Line on Ford StockThe tariff on Mexican imports will delay but probably not deny the long-awaited recovery of Ford stock.In the near term, new tariffs on goods from Mexico bring a great deal of uncertainty for Ford. The status of Ford's push into electric vehicles comes into question. More importantly, owners of Ford stock now have to wonder what effects the duties will have on Ford's supply chain.Investors who have seen Ford stock slide for five years will face further delays in the stock's recovery. With the 6.4% dividend yield, long-term holders of Ford stock should probably ride out the trade dispute. Even if the company cuts the payout again next year, it will remain well above S&P averages.Prospective buyers face a more uncertain path. Six months from now, we do not know if this episode will be in the distant past or if consumers will face even higher tariffs on Mexican goods.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth Admittedly, the low multiple, the payout, and the recent history of Ford stock lessen the risk of buying now. However, until traders know more about the effects of tariffs on Ford's supply chain, new buyers should probably wait.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

In Charles Schwab’s annual Modern Wealth Survey, the amount people said it took to be considered rich averaged out to $2.3 million.  Among baby boomers (roughly age 55 to 73), the average net worth you need to be considered wealthy is $2.6 million, 35% higher than what millennials envision as the admission price to the plutocracy.  The Schwab survey, which took a national sample of 1,000 Americans between the ages of 21 and 75, also revealed that the majority of Americans really crave real estate. More than 50% of respondents across generations said that if they got a $1 million windfall, they’d spend it, and the most popular purchase would be a place to live—particularly among millennials (roughly age 22 to 37). Those millennials also took issue with the premise of the survey.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-money-wealthy-america-110015807.html?.tsrc=rss

That's another record.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)Leading the charge was Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), which shot up nearly 8% after posting impressive first-quarter numbers and following them up with an equally-impressive full-year outlook. The company earned 9 cents per share versus analyst expectations of 5 cents. General Electric (NYSE:GE) was a top performer too, up more than 4% on an encouraging first-quarter of its own.Holding the market back more than any other name was Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), which fell nearly 8% after missing last quarter's sales estimates.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 A-Rated Stocks the Smart Money Is Piling Into But despite all of yesterday's excitement, heading into today's session, it's the stock charts of American International Group (NYSE:AIG), Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) that are worth the closest looks from traders. Here's why. Activision Blizzard (ATVI)When ATVI stock broke down in October of last year and it broke down hard. Slipping under the support line that had held it up for the better part of 2018 started a landslide. Few would argue that it wasn't overdone, but nobody was willing to be the first to try and catch a falling knife.However, the knife appears to not only have landed now, but it appears to be on the rise again. There's just one more hurdle to move past before the masses will likely feel safe enough to power a rebound rally.  Click to Enlarge  * The line in question is around $48.80, plotted with a white dashed line on both stock charts. ATVI stock has peaked there several times this year, including this week.  * Underscoring the bullish case is the first higher low seen since late last year, which was provided courtesy of new support at the purple 50-day moving average line in mid-April.  * It's not the only gap to be filled, but if Activision Blizzard can get over the hump, there's a big gap from November that's beckoning ATVI back to the $62 area. Charles Schwab (SCHW)With just a quick glance, it only looks as if SCHW stock remains in a shallow, choppy downtrend. There's more underway here than it seems on the surface, however. Slowly but surely the bulls are moving toward a breakout thrust, having laid the groundwork for it over the course of the past several months.The good news is, the remaining lines in the sand are easily identifiable, and there's little left to impede a recovery move if those ceilings can just be cleared.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares   Click to Enlarge  * One of the lines in question is the resistance that has tagged all the key highs going back to November, plotted in blue on both stock charts. The other likely ceiling is the white 200-day moving average line.  * Bolstering the bullish case is the shape of the chart leading into the latest test of that technical resistance. SCHW stock logged its first higher low in months in March, and the pattern since November is an (admittedly sloppy) upside-down head-and-shoulders pattern that should fuel any breakout.  * It's not shown or evident on either of the stock charts, but small and mid-cap financial stocks are finding more bullish traction than most other groups. That's boosting Schwab shares as well. American International Group (AIG)Several months ago American International Group was featured as a potential breakout candidate, if it could shatter the technical ceiling that had been holding it down since November. That never happened. Although AIG took several more shots at that resistance, it never buckled.That has changed within the past month, and then some. Not only has American International broken through a major technical ceiling, it has broken above a key moving average line after finding resistance at that line just a few days ago. There's little left to hold it back now.  Click to Enlarge  * The technical ceiling in question is around $44.90, plotted in yellow on both stock charts.  * As of Monday, AIG is above the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. For good measure, AIG stock put some distance between itself and that long-term line on Tuesday.  * Underscoring the recent breakout thrust is a growing level of daily volume behind the advance.  * Although it's easy to overlook, bolstering the case that the move above the 200-day line is a key event is that the very same 200-day moving average line briefly quelled the rally effort in mid-April.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-16	2019-01-16 23:38:41	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Charles Schwab Earnings: SCHW Stock Surges on Q4 Earnings Beat	"Charles Schwab earnings (NYSE:SCHW) were released early in the day on Wednesday, helping to lift SCHW shares higher as the company's profit was stronger than what analysts were calling for in their consensus estimate.

The bank and brokerage firm said that for its fourth quarter of its fiscal 2018, it brought in profit of $935 million, or 65 cents per share, which is higher than the $597 million, or 41 cents per share, it brought in during its fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Analysts were calling for profit of 64 cents per share, according to data compiled by FactSet.

Charles Schwab added that it booked $2.67 billion in net revenue during the period, marking a 19% gain from its year-ago quarter, while also surpassing the $2.64 billion that analysts were calling for, according to FactSet. The company's net-interest revenue surged about 42% to $1.63 billion, while its asset management and administrative fees slid 13% to $755 million.

The company added that its trading revenue gained $52 million from $154 million to $206 million year-over-year. Charles Schwab also said that clients opened roughly 380,000 new brokerage accounts during the period, which is lower than the 386,000 new accounts opened during the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2017.

This decline is due to the fact that stock markets were volatile late last year, according to the firm.

SCHW stock is up about 5.5% during regular trading hours as of the end of trading on Wednesday. Shares did not move after the bell.

2018-11-30	2018-11-30 16:05:35	SCHW	The Charles Schwab Corporation	Best Online Brokers, 2018	As the world of online brokers continues to evolve, it has become increasingly difficult for firms to stand apart from one another. In this year&apos;s ranking, TD Ameritrade beat Charles Schwab by less than a nose, with Fidelity and then E*Trade close behind. But zoom in, and you&apos;ll find that each firm, along with the four others we surveyed, has something different to offer--a niche that lets it shine in one way or another. With commissions about $7 or less at most firms, we gave that category less weight this year. But because the firms we surveyed told us that investors increasingly interact with them on smartphones or tablets, we gave more importance to mobile apps. The biggest, best-known firms, you&apos;ll notice, score better overall in our survey. But almost all of the firms let you trade stocks, exchange-traded funds, mutual funds and individual bonds online, as well as offer some online advisory services.  Read on to find out how each of these eight firms scored--and which would be best match for you.

What are the payoffs from being vulnerable?  It can inspire awesome leadership.  For example, in 2017, under Bettinger’s leadership, Charles Schwab topped both the J.D.
