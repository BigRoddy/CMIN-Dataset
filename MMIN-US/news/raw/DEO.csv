2021-03-08	2021-03-08 22:24:46	DEO	Diageo plc	Diageo Debuts Ready-To-Drink Crown Royal Canned Cocktails	Diageo plc (NYSE: DEO) has launched a ready-to-drink canned cocktail line under its Crown Royal Canadian Whisky brand. What Happened: The new line comes in three flavors: • Washington Apple featuring Crown Royal whisky, apple and sparkling cranberry flavors • Whisky & Cola featuring Crown Royal whisky and cola • Peach Tea featuring Crown Royal whisky, peach flavor and brewed tea The new canned cocktails are available for a suggested retail price of $14.99 for a four-pack of a single flavor and $3.99 for a single 12-fluid ounce can. Why It Matters: Although the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the nation’s bars, liquor stores remained opened because state governments viewed it as an essential business. As a result, alcohol consumption shifted from local watering spots to living rooms and dining rooms, with ready-to-drink offerings taking on a new popularity. Diageo's North American market recorded a net sales increase of 12.3% during the last six months of 2020, which was also the company's first half of fiscal 2021. Much of the activity was fueled by sales of ready-to-drink offerings in its Smirnoff, Ketel One Botanical and Tanqueray portfolios. In an interview with Yahoo Finance Live last week, Diageo North America President Debra Crew did not see the trend abating. “We're just seeing that people want more optionality in their ready-to-drink,” she said. “It used to be if you wanted ready-to-drink, you could just have beer. Now you can have all sorts of cocktails as well. And people have really latched on to that trend.” (Photo: Diageo) See more from BenzingaClick here for options trades from BenzingaDid Burger King UK Tweet A Misogynist Message On International Women's Day?DuPont Acquires Laird Performance Materials For .3B© 2021 Benzinga.com.

2021-03-07	2021-03-07 09:02:34	DEO	Diageo plc	The best all-weather stocks to add to your Isa revealed	When weighing up how to use the annual Isa allowance, most investors stick to funds – and for good reason. They can own hundreds of stocks, so one dud firm will not do too much damage to a portfolio. It also helps that professional stockpickers are at the helm, ready to steer the fund through difficult markets. But owning lots of stocks through funds also limits how much money an investor can make. By investing in top shares directly, they can increase returns – the hard part is finding the companies which can be left alone to make money, rather than requiring constant monitoring. We asked fund managers which “all-weather” companies they would recommend a DIY investor added to their Isa if they wanted to increase their returns. First, investors must take a step back and review where they are in their investment journey. Young people can afford to take on more risk in the pursuit of higher returns, as they will not cash out until far into the future. Any short-term volatility can be absorbed without too much worry. Older people need to be more careful, as they may depend on investments for retirement income. Young investors For those in their twenties, Ben Barringer, of investment research group Quilter Cheviot, said big technology companies were a perfect fit for their Isas. Software giant Microsoft was his top pick. He said: “It has lots of recurring revenue from subscriptions, so keeps making money no matter what the economy does, and has a strong position in the booming cloud computing market.”	https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/best-weather-stocks-add-isa-090234404.html?.tsrc=rss

Strong US Market: Diageo's U.S. sales in the back half of 2020 were supported by more consumers switching away from beer and wine to spirits. Consumers have picked up a new habit of enjoying higher priced alcohol and duplicating a bar experience at their home. Global net sales were down year-over-year from 7.2 billion pounds ($9.86 billion) to 6.87 billion pounds. Sales of the tequila brands Don Julio and Casamigos surged by 80% and the spirit's percentage of total sales rose from 1% five years ago to 7%, according to The Wall Street Journal. Management's attempts to market Baileys as a year-long beverage paid off, as sales were up 12% in the period in the U.S. Related Link: Constellation Brands CEO: 'We're Going To Take A Significant Share' Of Seltzer Market View more earnings on DEO Global Environment Challenged: Despite strength in the U.S., sales in Europe and Turkey were down 10% and sales in the Asia Pacific fell 3%. The company noted consumers in several emerging markets were trading down to less expensive brands. Global beer sales were down 11% in the period, led by weakness in sales of Guinness, which is typically consumed at bars. Scotch sales were down 8% as sales at airports remained depressed. Recovery 'Hard To Predict': It is ""hard to predict"" when the COVID-19 pandemic will ease and sales at key categories like bars and airports will improve, Diageo CEO Ivan Menezes said on CNBC. When the world is ready to reopen, Diageo will be able to capitalize through a $100-million recovery fund it launched last year to address the pent-up demand, he said. ""The consumer desire to socialize, to go to sporting events, to go to festivals is stronger than ever,"" the CEO said. ""So the consumer is going to return."" Photo: Diageo.

2021-01-28	2021-01-28 09:09:15	DEO	Diageo plc	Diageo, Fevertree Rebound on U.S. Tequila, Cocktail Thirst	(Bloomberg) -- Diageo Plc, the world’s largest distiller, and high-end tonic maker Fevertree Drinks Plc signaled the drinks industry is set to benefit from rising U.S. consumption of tequila and cocktails.Diageo reported a surprise gain in revenue in the six months through December as sales of its tequila brands, which include Casamigos and Don Julio, soared 80% in North America. Fevertree’s 2020 sales dropped 3%, less than expected, as gains in the U.S. offset declines in Britain.“The pandemic led to a sustained shift to at-home consumption in the U.S., reflecting the growing interest in making long mixed drinks,” Fevertree said, adding it’s confident for 2021 despite uncertainties related to the coronavirus.Diageo’s North American sales rose 12%, offsetting declines in most other regions. Growth in tequila is partly attributed to Diageo’s 100% agave label, Chief Financial Officer Kathy Mikells said on a conference call with reporters, referring to the ingredient of the liquor which is increasingly becoming popular for perceived health benefits. Casamigos, a tequila brand co-founded by actor George Clooney and later acquired by Diageo, more than doubled its revenue in the period amid a surge in cocktail drinking at home during lockdowns.Shares of Diageo rose as much as 4.5%. Fevertree, which makes pink grapefruit soda for tequila-based Paloma cocktails, gained as much as 4.4%.Diageo said it expects to see improvement in sales and profit in the six months through June as the closure of bars and restaurants in the year-earlier period decimated a crucial source of its income.“Cocktail making continues to evolve -- we’re well beyond the margarita,” Mikells said. The CFO is set to leave in June after almost six years in her role, to be replaced by Lavanya Chandrashekar, head of investor relations and CFO for North America.Diageo is expecting “a significant improvement” in its performance during the key Chinese New Year celebrations over last year, although demand could be tempered in cities affected by local outbreaks, according to Mikells.(Updates with North American revenue in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/diageo-fevertree-rebound-u-tequila-090915468.html?.tsrc=rss

Investing in overseas stocks carries its own set of risks, including the impact of currency exchange and geopolitical turmoil.

2020-08-04	2020-08-04 18:26:59	DEO	Diageo plc	Diageo's Full-Year Results Offer Glimpse Into Alcohol Sales During COVID-19	Shares of Diageo plc (NYSE: DEO) were losing ground Tuesday after the parent company of Johnnie Walker and other alcohol brands released preliminary full-year results for fiscal 2020. What Happened: Diageo, the world's largest alcohol maker, said total net sales for the fiscal year were down 8.7% at 11.8 billion pounds ($15.4 billion).Diageo CEO Ivan Menezes said in the release that the COVID-19 pandemic more than erased gains made in the first part of the year.Diageo also owns iconic brands like Smirnoff vodka and Guinness beer.The North American market recorded organic net sales growth of 2%, mostly from strong sales in grocery stores.But this trend wasn't duplicated elsewhere, as Americans tend to consume more alcohol at home than in bars or restaurants.Diageo's second-largest market, India, recorded a 17% organic sales decrease, as alcohol sales were banned in the country amid the pandemic.Elsewhere, the typical Korean consumer started to transition away from Scotch in favor of low-alcohol products.The company also took a 1.36-billion-pound impairment charge due to challenging conditions in India, Korea, Nigeria and Ethiopia.Diageo's Online Presence: The alcohol industry isn't typically associated with a thriving online business, but Diageo is adapting. The company saw its e-commerce business double in the most recent quarter, although it is still a relatively small part of the business, Diageo CEO Ivan Menezes said in a Bloomberg TV interview.View more earnings on DEOThe company is also benefiting from U.S. bars offering cocktail kits consisting of its beverages for delivery, the CEO said.Similar delivery options are being offered throughout the world, such as in some states in India, East Africa and elsewhere, he said. &quot;We are moving with a log of agility to ensure we are serving our consumers effectively under these conditions.&quot; Consumers Will Return: While consumers will ultimately want to return to bars, restaurants, concerts, and events, Diageo is focusing on creating experiences at home, Menezes said.As an example, the company heavily pushed Bailey's liquor as a baking ingredient and advertised unique drink ideas out of ingredients typically found in someone's cupboard.&quot;There is a huge desire to get bar quality cocktails at home,&quot; the CEO said. DEO Price Action: Diageo shares were down 4.87% at $140.87 at last check Tuesday.

2020-07-23	2020-07-23 05:00:47	DEO	Diageo plc	Brandy and Gin Are the Perfect Drinks in a Pandemic	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Lockdown has us all reaching for the brandy. That’s a tonic for high-end liquor makers, but a worry for brewers of mainstream beers.French spirits group Remy Cointreau SA said this week that its first-half profit wouldn’t plunge as much as it initially feared, thanks to consumers in the U.S., U.K. and Australia mixing more drinks at home. Similarly, Fevertree Drinks Plc, which makes popular mixers such as elderflower tonic water and smoky ginger ale, said last week that its sales through retailers rose by just over a third in the U.K. in the 12 weeks to June 14.As bars, pubs and restaurants shut down, Americans and Brits wanting a tipple had little choice but to sip in their living rooms, gardens and balconies. Instead of pouring a quick beer after work, however, come 5:30 or 6 p.m. many would try their hand at crafting a Negroni or an Aperol spritz. Perhaps they even had time to bring out that bottle of vermouth last seen a few holidays ago and experiment with new creations.  It helps that the appetite for cocktails has grown in recent years, as many consumers, particularly younger Americans, have turned away from mass-market beer and toward different drinks, including spirits. Ever more focused on healthy living, they prefer to drink less alcohol, but make it premium.During the pandemic, Remy Cointreau pivoted its marketing toward home drinking, offering online master classes from bartenders on how to mix inspired cocktails. Its efforts, and those of rival Diageo Plc, got a boost from a range of influencers and celebrities, such as “Bridesmaids” director Paul Feig, who started hosting virtual cocktail hours of their own. Now mixing a drink at home has become a special occasion — a moment of indulgence, a way to socialize and an excuse to swap sweatpants for something smarter.It’s no surprise that Cointreau, an ingredient in the Margarita, the Sidecar and the Cosmopolitan, has been the star performer for the company this year. The spirit's retail sales have managed to offset lost sales in bars and pubs. But across the group’s portfolio, the thirst for homemade concoctions can’t fully make up for the decline in liquor sales through restaurants, bars and travel retail — venues where people are more inclined to trade up to a pricier tipple and where demand has mostly collapsed.Despite the better-than-expected performance, Remy Cointreau’s first-half operating profits are still projected to fall by between 35% and 40% from the same time last year.The situation for beer brewers is likely to be even worse. Consumers not only trade down when drinking beer at home, they often choose the cheapest option in the supermarket. After years of slowing growth for mainstream beer brands, that’s more bad news for the likes of heavily indebted brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev SA. Meanwhile, the picture for wine is mixed: Demand has stalled in the U.S. and U.K. over the past couple of years, but it looks to have gotten a lift from lockdown.Profit pressures should ease as more bars and restaurants reopen. But amid rising unemployment, some consumers may rein in their spending wherever they choose to drink. Others may still be nervous about venturing out, further entrenching the trend for home drinking.The garden gin-and-tonic may be a feature for some time yet.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

Combined with a pandemic-fueled economic slowdown, the threat to Facebook is deepening.“Given the amount of noise this is drawing, this will have significant impact to Facebook’s business,” Wedbush Securities analyst Bradley Gastwirth wrote in a research note. “Facebook needs to address this issue quickly and effectively in order to stop advertising exits from potentially spiraling out of control.”Shares gained 2.1% Monday to close at $220.64 in New York, after dropping 8.3% on Friday. Unilever, one of the world’s largest advertisers, said it would cease spending on Facebook properties this year, eliminating $56 billion in market value and shaving the net worth of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg by more than $7 billion.Facebook was already bracing for weakness in the second quarter, which ends this week. Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner said in an April earnings call that he saw the “potential for an even more severe advertising industry contraction.”The number of coronavirus cases has surged in the intervening months, prompting many parts of the country to slow or roll back reopening efforts and giving advertisers added justification to rein in spending. Facebook’s sales will rise 1% in the June period, followed by a 7% increase in the third quarter, analysts predict, by far the smallest quarterly growth increases since the company went public.Advertiser boycotts in July could cost Facebook more than $250 million in the third quarter if 25% of its top 100 buyers pause spending, and as much as $500 million if 50% of the top advertisers stop, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jitendra Waral.Zuckerberg announced changes Friday designed to appease critics, but the Anti-Defamation League, one of the groups calling for the boycott, called the amendments “small.”Some analysts have said the financial impact of recent exits will be limited, citing past advertiser revolts. Even so, this exodus is distinct in key ways, Bernstein Securities analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a research note Saturday. There’s heightened pressure to publicly demonstrate that brands stand with civil-rights groups, he said.“The current environment is very different,” Shmulik wrote. “It is very visible who is and isn’t participating in the boycott where brand silence [equals] being complicit.”(Updates to add Microsoft withdrawl in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-shares-poised-fall-starbucks-084522495.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-28	2020-06-28 17:58:19	DEO	Diageo plc	Facebook’s Growing Ad Exodus Means More Risks to Revenue Growth	(Bloomberg) -- A growing list of Facebook Inc.’s advertisers is set to halt spending on social media, undermining the company’s sales outlook and putting its stock price under further pressure.Starbucks Corp., Levi Strauss & Co., PepsiCo Inc. and Diageo Plc were among the most recent companies to say they’re curtailing ad spending, part of an exodus aimed at pushing Facebook and its peers to suppress posts that glorify violence, divide and disinform the public, and promote racism and discrimination.No single company can significantly dent growth at Facebook, which generated $17.7 billion in revenue last quarter alone. But a rising tally adds to pressure on other brands to follow suit, and when combined with a pandemic-fueled economic slowdown, the threat to Facebook deepens.“Given the amount of noise this is drawing, this will have significant impact to Facebook’s business,” Wedbush Securities analyst Bradley Gastwirth wrote in a research note. “Facebook needs to address this issue quickly and effectively in order to stop advertising exits from potentially spiraling out of control.”As more brands publicize plans to join boycotts or otherwise rein in ad spending, Facebook shares remain under pressure. The stock tumbled 8.3% Friday after Unilever, one of the world’s largest advertisers, said it would halt spending on Facebook properties this year, eliminating $56 billion in market value and shaving the net worth of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg by more than $7 billion. Shares closed at $216.08 Friday after reaching a record $242.24 the preceding Tuesday.Facebook was already bracing for weakness in the second quarter, which ends this week. Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner noted in an April earnings call the “potential for an even more severe advertising industry contraction.”The number of coronavirus cases has surged in the intervening months, prompting many parts of the country to slow or roll-back reopening efforts and giving advertisers added justification to rein in marketing spending. Facebook will eke out 1% revenue growth in the June period, followed by a 7% increase in the third quarter, according to analysts’ current projections, by far the smallest quarterly growth increases since the company went public.Starbucks said Sunday that it would pause spending on all social media platforms while it carries out talks internally, with media partners and civil rights groups “in the effort to stop the spread of hate speech.”Trump PostsWhile some companies are targeting social media generally, including Twitter Inc., many are singling out Facebook specifically. Zuckerberg has been more reticent to put limits on discourse, notably controversial posts by U.S. President Donald Trump, saying that he doesn’t want Facebook to be an arbiter of what’s true.That’s prompted a consortium of civil rights and other advocacy groups, including Color of Change and the Anti-Defamation League, to urge advertisers to stop spending on Facebook-owned platforms for July to protest the company’s policies.Zuckerberg responded Friday to the growing criticism, saying that Facebook would label all voting-related posts with a link encouraging users to look at its new voter information hub. The social network also expanded its definition of prohibited hate speech for advertising.“We understand people want to put pressure on Facebook to do more,” Facebook vice president Nick Clegg said Sunday on CNN’s Reliable Sources. “That’s why we made those additional announcements in Friday. That’s why we’ll continue to redouble our efforts, because, you know, we have a zero tolerance approach to hate speech.”The Anti-Defamation League called the changes “small.”The stampede of advertisers, combined with lobbying from civil rights groups, leaves Zuckerberg in a bind. He could take further steps to curtail harmful content, but that risks alienating free-speech advocates and supporters of Trump who have argued that Facebook is censoring political discourse and suppressing conservative voices.Distinct ExodusHe could also stand pat on a bet that this advertising pause will be short-lived, as have social media ad boycotts in the past. But this exodus as distinct, Bernstein Securities analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a research note Saturday. There’s heightened pressure to publicly demonstrate that brands stand with civil rights groups, he said. “The current environment is very different,” Shmulik wrote. “It is very visible who is and isn’t participating in the boycott where brand silence [equals] being complicit.”Will Zuckerberg budge? While major brands like Unilever and Coca-Cola have garnered most of the headlines, the vast majority of Facebook’s 8 million advertisers are small businesses, many of which rely heavily on Facebook advertising for sales. Some in the ad industry don’t believe that these businesses, particularly those in commerce and direct-to-consumer sales, can actually afford to halt spending.“Pulling off for a whole month would really hurt their business,” Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley said earlier this week. “It’s a lot to ask for.”In its outreach to advertisers last week, Facebook has said it doesn’t intend to make decisions based on sales. “We have been consistent that we do not make policy changes tied to revenue pressure,” Facebook said on Wednesday in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. “We set our policies based on principles rather than business interests.”Whatever additional moves Facebook makes, there’s reason to believe the departure of advertisers won’t end soon. “Advertisers who have seen their own ads published against hateful, horrible content on Facebook -- racist, anti-Semitic poison -- they are finally saying ‘enough’,” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Our phones have been ringing off the hook with advertisers. I can tell you more are coming.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-growing-ad-exodus-means-175819945.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-09	2020-06-09 07:04:53	DEO	Diageo plc	What Do You Prefer, Nosecco or Prosecco?	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Fancy a glass of Nosecco?The alcohol-free sparkling wine might not be to everyone’s taste, but its catchy name caused a fight between a French group and the Italian producers of Prosecco. The outcome could have implications for companies looking to ride the trend toward alcohol-free alternatives to traditional drinks and vegan offerings that strive to look and taste like meat and dairy products.While familiar packaged-food brands, such as Kraft macaroni and cheese and Nestle’s Hot Pockets, enjoyed a revival during the pandemic, the long-term prospects remain brighter for products that are perceived as healthier. Just look at the rise of the vegan sausage roll sold at Greggs Plc. Its arrival prompted the U.K. baker to upgrade its profit forecasts several times in 2019.In fact, with the unprecedented focus on health precipitated by the novel coronavirus outbreak, the opportunities for categories such as fake meat, fish and eggs may be even bigger. What happens in the Nosecco case could be a lesson for the upstarts.Nosecco has been sold in the U.K. since 2017, and Les Grands Chais de France, the country’s largest independent wine producer responsible for J.P. Chenet and Chemin des Papes wines, wanted to establish a trademark for it. It was challenged in 2018 by a consortium representing the northeast Italian region where Prosecco is produced, which said the name brought to mind the Italian wine, which is protected by European rules on origin.The French company argued the name was never meant to rival Prosecco in the U.K. Instead, it was chosen to capture the drink’s alcohol-free quality while playing on the fact that it wasn’t “sec,” or dry, like the Italian wine, but rather sweet. But the U.K.’s Intellectual Property Office found in favor of the Italian producers, deciding that in the minds of consumers the name Nosecco evoked the hugely popular Prosecco. There was a serious risk, it said, that consumers would believe the drink was in fact non-alcoholic Prosecco. Les Grands Chais de France is now appealing the decision in the High Court.The company is not alone in facing delicate marketing issues when it comes to new food categories. It has long been debated whether dairy alternatives can be classed as milk. In Sweden, that’s culminated in a “milk war” between the country’s dairy industry and Oatly, a Swedish manufacturer of oat milk. There’s no clear winner, but the skirmish doesn’t seem to have done Oatly any harm: Oat milk is hot around the world right now. In what could be a challenge to the rise of meat substitutes, some U.S. states, including Arkansas and Mississippi, have sought to restrict the use of terms such as burgers and dogs. (Mississippi now allows plant-based food makers to use some terms so long as they carry modifiers such as meat-free.)Naming battles will likely crop up between competing alternative-food makers, too. Just last week, Nestle SA, the world’s biggest food company, said it would rename its Incredible plant-based patties as the Sensational burger. The move came after a Dutch court upheld an injunction filed by Impossible Foods Inc., citing a trademark infringement. Nestle said it will appeal the ruling.What is clear is that producers of everything from lupin burgers to non-alcoholic gin must work hard to stand out. While there is huge growth to be had, the competition will be stiff. Traditional food companies and brewers are piling in, too. Drinks giant Diageo Plc last year acquired a majority stake in Seedlip, the non-alcoholic spirit maker.There is no doubt that Nosecco was a stroke of marketing genius. But it has ended up in a protracted legal wrangle. Amid the shifting landscape for alternatives, producers will need to be innovative and creative with their branding. The Vegetarian Butcher, the meat-substitute maker acquired by Unilever Plc in December 2018, is perhaps a good example. It’s not always easy to get the message across that a dish or drink is a vegan or non-alcoholic version of an old favorite, and in an appealing way, but marketers will need to dig deep.  Otherwise, as Nosecco has shown, they could have a fight on their hands, and that’s not very appetizing for anyone.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-06-01	2020-06-01 17:50:12	DEO	Diageo plc	3 Outdoor Stocks To Watch For Summer 2020	People are chomping at the bit to finally get outside after months of hunkering down during quarantine. One saving grace for many was the fact that the nationwide lockdown from work, school, and general public activity took place during the cooler months of late winter and spring.With such precautions beginning to calm down and the weather starting to heat up, there's excitement in the markets surrounding outdoor stocks. Here are a few companies that might be poised to benefit this summer.Yeti Yeti Holdings Inc (NYSE: YETI) is one of the most well-known outdoor sporting companies on the market. Its most popular products include ice chests, drinkware and other naturistic accessories that are suited for activities like camping, fishing and spending time with the family outdoors.With people able to get outside as the summer months hit, Yeti could recover nicely from the roughly 15% drop off it experienced during the coronavirus' most fierce months.Chris Camillo, founder of TickerTags and host of &quot;Dumb Money LIVE,&quot; thinks Yeti's public exclusivity in its specific industry creates opportunities.&quot;This summer, anyone that makes anything related to taking your drinks outside, or keeping your drinks cool in your boat, or on a camping trip, or at the lake house, or just out by the pool is gonna kill it,&quot; he said. &quot;And none of those other stocks are public, (but) Yeti is.&quot;See Also: 4 Stocks Poised To Breakout With The Return Of Live SportsCallaway Golf Callaway Golf Co (NYSE: ELY) doesn't necessarily stand out from other golf brands, such as Nike (NYSE: NKE) or Adidas (OTC: ADDYY), from an apparel or equipment perspective. But one of its most lucrative assets is TopGolf, the indoor golf and entertainment craze.Over the past few years, TopGolf has grown to become one of the most popular spots for hanging out with friends, parties and more.Callaway has given up around 20% in value since the start of the coronavirus and is trading around the $15.50 level. Due to TopGolf's ability to maintain small group settings in a semi-outdoor environment, it may be ahead of its entertainment competitors in being allowed to open up shop.Camillo commented on the show that he sees TopGolf's efficiency as a catalyst in its tremendous growth over the past few years.&quot;TopGolf is gonna kill it,&quot; he said. &quot;Callaway is ideally positioned...this is the summer of golf.&quot;Diageo Many people will finally be able to kick back and have a cold drink with friends once again. And, of course, no drink feels like summer more than tequila.Thus, there is plenty of potential for Diageo plc (NYSE: DEO), owner of Don Julio and CasaMigos, to see success. Since the onset of serious restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic in late February, the stock's value has dropped roughly 12%. Buyers may be interested in buying the dip here with lockdowns being lifted and outdoor bars starting to get more and more full.Camillo, while analyzing recent spikes in tequila and margarita drinking activity in the country, noted CasaMigos specifically is a top asset for Diageo.&quot;It's been astonishing to watch what CasaMigos has done over the past couple of years in terms of their marketing effort. They've been just killing it,&quot; he said.&quot;I think Diageo is really well positioned as part of the great outdoor trade of 2020.&quot;See more from Benzinga  * This Small-Cap Stock Just Ripped 20% Higher On New Online Gambling Deal  * These 10 Stocks Have Surged During The Coronavirus Pandemic(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Sign up here.Diageo Plc, the world’s largest distiller, lowered its outlook for sales growth amid weakness in key markets including India as the industry faces risks from trade battles and the spread of the coronavirus.Sales growth will probably be near the lower end of the 4% to 6% targeted range in the year through June, Diageo said Thursday. Previously Diageo guided to the midpoint. Sales rose 4.2% on an adjusted basis in the six months through December, matching analysts’ estimates.Chief Executive Officer Ivan Menezes said in a statement that the distiller was facing increased levels of volatility and uncertainty in the global trade environment “and we would not be immune from further policy changes.” Diageo warned investors in September that trade tensions could undermine a positive start to the financial year.Sales from the travel retail division declined 18%, hindered by rising tensions and challenging trading conditions in the Mideast region and lower passenger traffic in cities including Hong Kong, which has been impacted by social unrest. Growth slowed in India as the economy weakened there. Economic and political unrest in countries such as Mexico, Peru and Chile affected Diageo’s business in Latin America.Diageo finds it hard to predict when economic conditions might improve in markets such as India, Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said on a call with journalists.She said it’s too soon to see what impact the coronavirus will have on business in China, where Diageo owns the Shui Jing Fang baijiu brand and has opened retail outlets for its Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky. Sales grew 24% in the market last year.Diageo has suspended travel to China, and ensuring the safety of staff in that country is the main priority, she said, adding that the mainland accounts for about 4% of total revenue.The shares rose 1.1% as of 8:36 a.m. in London. They have dropped about 9% in the past six months.Diageo benefits from geographic and portfolio diversity, Mikells said. The U.K. division held up fairly well despite concerns Brexit would weigh on consumption. The North American business --which accounts for a third of sales -- delivered revenue growth of 6%, helped by growth of spirits.(Updates with comments from CFO starting in fifth paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: Thomas Buckley in London at tbuckley25@bloomberg.net;Deirdre Hipwell in London at dhipwell@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Eric Pfanner at epfanner1@bloomberg.net, Thomas Mulier, Anne PollakFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/diageo-lowers-sales-forecast-slowdown-071815953.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-22	2019-12-22 00:00:51	DEO	Diageo plc	A Festive Warning for World's Favorite Liquor	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Growing up in the U.K. in the 1980s, the Christmas season was associated with particular foods and drinks. Pies made from fruit “mincemeat”; the same dried fruits cooked into Christmas pudding; grandparents passing round glasses of sherry.Believe it or not, that nostalgic memory hints at a long-term risk to the most bullish corner of the global liquor market: China’s sorghum-based firewater, baijiu.The past few years have seen extraordinary growth for baijiu makers. Kweichow Moutai Co., the maker of the most prestigious brand, overtook Diageo Plc to become the world’s biggest distiller by market capitalization in 2017. Now it’s in a whole other league, overtaking even Anheuser-Busch InBev SA and PepsiCo Inc. on that measure and within spitting distance of taking Coca-Cola Co.’s crown as the world’s largest beverage company.What’s more, this success has been built on the back not of a valuation bubble, but of relatively pedestrian assumptions about earnings. Kweichow Moutai is on a lower price-earnings multiple than Brown-Forman Corp., Davide Campari-Milano SpA and Remy Cointreau SA. Luzhou Laojiao Co. is cheaper on that measure than any major western distiller.What could possibly put a cloud on the horizon of this thriving market? The most serious looming risk is embodied in those nostalgic memories of a British Christmas: demographics.Throughout baijiu’s boom, it’s struggled to shake the perception that it’s primarily a drink for older men. Its former image as an unofficial currency of corrupt government officials has receded since a campaign against official graft in the early years of President Xi Jinping’s reign. Still, the connotations of rich older men exchanging drunken toasts remain, even if the drinkers in the stereotype are now more likely to be employed in the private than the public sector.“Many young people still think that baijiu isn't for them, that no matter the flavor, it's not a drink for the young,” according to a China Daily article this year. “Drinking baijiu is increasingly seen as a dated behavior by younger Chinese uninterested in banquets and bravado,” wrote Jing Daily, a site specializing in the Chinese luxury market.That association with oldsters is a problem Spain’s sherry industry has been enduring for several decades. In the 1970s and 1980s, exports to the U.K., the Netherlands and the U.S. boomed in an unprecedented manner, to the point that bodega conglomerate Rumasa was reported to account for as much as 2% of Spanish GDP.Since then it’s been in long-term decline. Sherry’s core consumers outside Spain have reached a more abstemious age or died out, while younger drinkers shun a product they associate with their grandparents. For all that many wine connoisseurs sing its praises and lament sherry’s fall from grace, it’s hard to see the glory days returning.This trajectory is a common one in the alcohol business, which lives and dies on the changing demographics of its consumers. One reason Japan’s brewers have been so desperate to acquire overseas businesses while Vietnamese ones have been M&A targets is that beer is drunk by thirsty workers, and Japan’s labor force is declining while Vietnam’s is rising. The same goes for clear spirits like baijiu. Its success is hard to separate from the fact that China’s population of men aged 40 to 60 increased by more than half over the past two decades, adding about 78 million people to the core baijiu-drinking market. That demographic is set to stagnate over the coming decade, though, before beginning an accelerating decline after 2030.To the extent that the industry is making any inroads with women and younger people, it’s in lower-cost, lighter-flavored “rice aroma” products where margins are tighter. The giant listed baijiu-makers specialize in the complex, higher-cost “sauce aroma” and “strong aroma” varieties such as Maotai and Luzhou Laojiao, which is quite a different product.This needn’t be the end of the world. The drinks market’s best defense against unfavorable demographics is “premiumization” — counting not on a larger number of consumers, but a small group paying more and more. Premiumization is already the strategy of the high-end listed baijiu companies, so there's no reason they can’t keep going with it.Still, chasing the luxury market is notoriously expensive in marketing terms, and baijiu makers for years have been able to rely on a product that sells itself.Major distillers typically dedicate a third or more of their revenue to selling, general and administrative costs — mostly marketing and distribution. Baijiu makers are far more thrifty, one reason their profit margins are so much fatter than those of peers. As their core demographic ages out of its drinking habit, though, they’re likely to have to spend more and more converting younger drinkers.Every cellar manager knows that liquors can get better with age, but the process of maturation has to be carefully monitored and cultivated if the precious drink isn’t to turn into drain-cleaner. Marketing departments of baijiu companies will have to be no less careful over the coming decades maintaining the shine on their storied brands. To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-11-20	2019-11-20 19:30:28	DEO	Diageo plc	Dan Snyder Makes a Bundle Mismanaging the Redskins	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s a grim time in Washington, and not just because of the impeachment hearings. The Washington Redskins, for decades the city’s most beloved institution, are simply awful.So far this season, they’re 1-9, and with six games left, they’ll be lucky to win another. Last Sunday they were thoroughly outplayed by the lowly New York Jets, losing 31-17. That loss prompted the Washington Post’s great sportswriter Thomas Boswell to declare that, with the Washington Nationals winning the World Series this year and the Washington Capitals the Stanley Cup in 2018, Washington no longer lives and dies by the Redskins.The game photograph that accompanied Boswell’s column showed something that has rarely been seen at Redskins games: lots and lots of empty seats.Everyone in Washington knows exactly who to blame for this state of affairs: 54-year-old billionaire owner Dan Snyder. After making his fortune with a marketing business (he eventually sold it for $2.1 billion), Snyder bought the Redskins in 1999 for $750 million. In the subsequent 20 years, they’ve had six winning seasons, eight last-place finishes, and exactly two playoff victories — and the last one was in 2005.Snyder has hired bad coaches and fired good ones. He’s made terrible free-agent signings. He would sometimes dictate to his coaches who to bench and who to play. In early October, when Snyder fired head coach Jay Gruden five games into the season, Mark Cannizzaro, the New York Post’s pro football columnist, wrote, “If the Redskins owner truly wanted what was best for his franchise, he would have fired himself.”But why would he? Despite Snyder’s 20-year record of football ineptitude, he’s made a boatload of money as the team’s owner. Last year, according to Forbes, which publishes annual rankings of sports franchises, the Redskins had $120 million in operating income(1)on $493 million in revenue. Among the 32 teams in the National Football League, only six teams earned more. Forbes also ranks the Redskins the seventh-most-valuable franchise, with an estimated valuation of $3.2 billion. (The Dallas Cowboys are ranked first with a $5.5 billion valuation.) Last year, despite another losing record, the team still rose 10% in value, according to Forbes.Which leads to the obvious question: Does it even matter whether Snyder — or any other pro football owner — has a winning team or a losing one? From a financial standpoint, the answer, plainly, is no. As the sports consultant Marc Ganis told me, “NFL teams don’t lose money.”This is in large part because the NFL has a “share the wealth” philosophy. (Or to put it the way the late Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell once did, the NFL is run “by a bunch of fat-cat Republicans who vote socialist on football.”) The NFL has multiyear, multibillion-dollar contracts with CBS, NBC, Fox, ESPN and DirecTV. That money is equally divided among the 32 teams, along with certain marketing and licensing deals negotiated by the NFL. In 2018 that pool of money amounted to $8.1 billion, or $255 million per team.The biggest expense for any team is player contracts. But don’t forget the salary cap, which places a limit on how much any NFL team can collectively pay all the players on its roster. It is currently $188.2 million. Michael Ozanian, who compiles the sports franchise rankings at Forbes, told me that when you include insurance, pensions and the like, most teams pay well over $200 million in salary-related expenses. Even so, the national TV contract alone more than covers the owners’ biggest expense.Then there’s gate revenue. In the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball, the home team keeps all the money generated from ticket sales. In the NFL, the visiting team gets 40 percent of the gate. The Redskins, for instance, had $43 million in gross ticket sales last year, and netted $28.5 million after giving the visiting teams their cut.All told, about 75% of the revenue that a team gets comes via money that is shared among all the teams. That still means that the other 25% has to be self-generated. Here is where you would think the Redskins would have a problem, given the way they’ve alienated their fans.But you would be wrong. One of the first things Snyder did after buying the team was cut a $205 million, 27-year deal with FedEx Corp. to change the name of the team’s stadium in Landover, Maryland, from Jack Kent Cooke Stadium to FedEx Field. (Cooke owned the team from 1974 until his death in 1997.) Snyder has since plastered FedEx Field with corporate sponsorships. In 2002, he cut a deal with Diageo Plc, the big liquor company, to put billboards in FedEx Field; they were strategically located to make sure that TV cameras would have to show them.The median ticket price for a Redskins game is $235. By one estimate, when you throw in parking and food, two people will pay $567 to attend a game, the ninth-highest cost for attending a league game. Snyder charges for fans to attend preseason practices (he charges for parking, too). He has come up with all kinds of schemes to extract fees from fans: fees to cut the security line on game day, for instance, or to get season tickets ahead of people who had signed up earlier. Indeed, all those empty seats may be held by season ticket holders who decided not to bother going to the game.One area where revenue has fallen for the Redskins is their haul from premium seating and luxury suites. In 2016 and 2017, that number was around $70 million, according to league data. More recently, it has dropped to around $65 million. It is hard to know whether that’s a function of the Redskins’ losing ways or the result of the elimination of the 50% tax deduction for client entertainment expenses that was part of the 2018 tax bill (corporations have traditionally liked booking suites to entertain clients).Of course, what smart team owners understand is that the best way to field a winning team is to hire really good football minds — and get out of their way. Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, was a meddler like Snyder in the early years of his ownership. But once he hired Bill Belichick as his head coach, he stopped getting involved in most football decisions.Twenty years in, it seems unlikely Snyder will ever learn that lesson. Redskins fans loathe him and most other NFL owners view him as a lightweight. But given the NFL’s business model, none of this matters. Most likely, Snyder will keep wrecking a once-great franchise while he keeps raking in the profits. Why should he change when there’s no consequence?(1) Forbes defines operating income as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.To contact the author of this story: Joe Nocera at jnocera3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Timothy L.

The long-term drop in the equity and the dividend may point to a potential bargain. However, political and business headwinds in Brazil point to significant challenges. Deciding whether to buy Ambev stock, investors must weigh these benefits against both the risk and their risk tolerance.Source: Anton Garin / Shutterstock.com Most Americans have few reasons to know Ambev. The Sao Paulo-based brewery is a subsidiary of Interbrew International, a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD). For most residents of the U.S., their familiarity with the company likely revolves around Labatt Blue, a familiar brand for those who visit Canada. Outside of the Canadian connection, Ambev operates in Latin America, primarily in its home market of Brazil. 3 Notable Risks of Ambev StockThis unfamiliarity with AmBev stock likely extends to its significant risks. For one, Ambev faces ongoing political turmoil in its home country. The company is currently contending with an antitrust complaint filed by competitors in Brazil. A group of 110 resellers and distributors alleges that ABEV has used its market position to push abusive commercial policies. If found guilty, AmBev could face a fine ranging from 0.1% to 20% of its revenue.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlso, in 2015, Ambev was tied to the Operation Car Wash corruption scandal in Brazil. However, Ambev products faced a massive tax increase that year, despite charges that the firm made &quot;inappropriate payments&quot; to two former Brazilian presidents to prevent the hike. However, the increase went into effect despite the allegation. To Vince Martin's point, that would either point to the company's innocence or highlight how poorly the firm has mastered the art of bribery.  * 7 Stocks to Buy in November Secondly, Vince Martin also makes another great point about the Brazil beer market itself. Brazil was the only one of the company's regions to decline in the first six months of the year. It also accounts for more than half of company profits. Many blame an emerging craft beer scene amid overall growth in the beer market. However, this may have begun to recover as the Brazil region saw modest revenue growth in the third quarter.Third, ABEV stock has experienced a downtrend since peaking at more than $9 per share in early 2013. After recovering to the $7.25 per share range in March 2018, the stock tanked, falling below $4 per share by the end of that year. It has spent about 18 months trading in a range and sells for around $4.30 per share as of the time of this writing.These risks increase the uncertainty surrounding ABEV stock. As of now, the company supports a forward price-earnings (PE) ratio of around 20.5. This might seem high for a company expected to post no profit growth this year and a 10.5% earnings increase in 2020. 3 Reasons to Buy ABEVHowever, ABEV stock offers some reward for the risks. First, the current dividend yield stands at 5.2%, assuming the expected 24 cent per share gets paid. The company pays a varied dividend on a non-consistent basis. It seems especially inconsistent as it has not yet made a payout in 2019.Secondly, the aforementioned 20.5 forward PE comes in much lower than the multiple for Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) and Diageo (NYSE:DEO). It also offers a higher dividend yield than Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP). While not the cheapest alcoholic beverage equity, it offers some unique benefits for investors willing to invest.Third, revenue also continues to hold up well. In the recent quarterly report, profits fell by 15.8% year-over-year due to higher income taxes. However, overall revenue increased by 5.9%. The only region to experience a decline was Canada, where they face more intense competition from craft beer. It also saw its highest growth in the Latin America south region, which prospers despite the economic turmoil in Argentina. Should I Buy ABEV Stock?Investors have good reasons to both avoid or take a chance on ABEV stock. The risks associated with the legal and business environment in Brazil may give investors second thoughts about buying at current levels. However, it has offered a generous, if volatile dividend. It also trades well compared to other alcoholic beverage peers. Growth in some regions also points to its resilience.As customers and Ambev adapt to the higher taxes, I expect profit growth to resume. Moreover, given the revenue growth, I expect the downward move in ABEV stock to break at some point. For those wanting a beverage stock and do not mind the risk, they should consider Ambev stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-10-14	2019-10-14 10:45:07	DEO	Diageo plc	6 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy Now	[Editor's note: &quot;6 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy Now&quot; was previously published in September 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]  From continuing concerns about the China-U.S. trade war to worries about the yield curve inversion, the stock market still faces many steep risks.America's political situation hasn't been this tense in decades. The EU is facing a host of challenges, and there's always volatility lurking somewhere.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdd it all up, and things could easily get volatile quite soon. That leaves investors wondering where they can go for safety.After years of tech outperforming everything, the problems facing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have many people bailing on those stocks  as well.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 That leaves safe-haven dividend stocks as a more favorable alternative. Here are six worth taking a look at. Diageo (DEO)Dividend Yield: 2.10%Rain or shine, good economy or bad, people like to drink alcohol. And for safe dividend seekers, that makes Diageo (NYSE:DEO) an ideal play. While its name may not be familiar, its brands almost certainly are. Diageo owns and manufactures Guinness beer, Captain Morgan rum, Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker whiskey, among many others.  Source: Puamella via Flickr (Modified)DEO stock is a well-known safe haven for investors. The company is headquartered in the U.K. and was one of the very few stocks to go up the day after Brexit in that country as British investors sold risky stocks and moved to safety. Diageo will again serve as a safe haven whenever the next bear market/recession hits.Diageo isn't just a great business, it's also a great dividend play. The company has continuously raised its dividend (as measured in its home currency of British Pounds) each of the past 20 years. Campbell Soup (CPB)Dividend Yield: 3%Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB)  is one of the unloved packaged-foods makers. It's not hard to see why, if you only think about the company's name. Canned soup certainly isn't trendy with younger consumers at this point. And there's a general nutritional wariness about heavily salted foods.Source: Shutterstock That said, there's much more to Campbell Soup than just the iconic red cans. The company is more and more a snack food play. As we know, while Americans profess an interest in healthier eating, they still love their junk food from time to time. Campbell's, owner of Hanover, Pop Secret, Goldfish and Pepperidge Farm, is in a great position to profit off of this.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 Pepsico (NYSE:PEP), the leader in snacks, consistently gets a high P/E ratio from the market, as investors acknowledge the stickiness of their brands with consumers. The market, however, is not appreciating Campbell Soup as much. Shares are down from $50 in 2017 to $47 now. PacWest Bancorp (PACW)Dividend Yield: 6.6%After investors dumped bank stocks late last year, a lot of value has been created in this generally overlooked sector of the market, where solid dividends abound.Source: Shutterstock That brings us to PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW), which offers a more-than 6% dividend yield at the moment. Headquartered in Los Angeles, PacWest is a major player throughout the California market and currently sports a $4 billion market cap. That puts it in a sweet spot, size-wise, where it may still be a buyout candidate, but it is large enough to manage the rising costs of regulation and banking technology costs.Despite the horrid state of the California housing market in 2008, PacWest survived the crisis. In fact, its shares never came close to zero during the panic. The bank has come out stronger, and is now generating record profits. Thanks to the corporate tax cuts in particular, PACW stock is now at a cheap P/E ratio of just 9.4 times its trailing earnings. New York Community Bancorp (NYCB)Dividend Yield: 5.22%Despite its large yield, New York Community Bancorp (NASDAQ:NYCB) is an even safer bank stock. NYCB stock currently yields 5.2%, and they earn more than enough to cover the dividend, with earnings coming in at around 79 cents and dividends at 68 cents annually.  NYCB stock was down 12% last year because the sector was down, as discussed above. Over the last few months, though, it has fought its way back to the levels it traded at before the fall. That's why the bank is one of the safest in the country. It lends primarily against multi-family homes in New York City, one of the lowest-risk lending markets out there.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 The bank's loans barely budged in performance even during 2008. With a strong dividend covered out of earnings and a safe loan book, investors can earn a large dividend income from a most conservative bank. Southern Co (SO)Dividend Yield: 4%In the worst of times, people tend to still want to use electricity. Even a severe economic downturn tends to not impact utility stocks too dramatically. As such, it's a sound sector to buy when investors get panicky, such as what we're seeing with the market now.Source: Desiree Kane via FlickrSouthern Co (NYSE:SO), as one of the highest-yielding large power utilities, checks the boxes for safe dividend stocks here. SO stock is currently yielding 4%.Its high yield is in large part, it seems, due to interest rates having gone up. Many investors treat utility stocks as substitutes for bonds. As such, when interest rates go up, investors demand a higher yield from their utility stock as well. If interest rates were to keep surging for years to come, SO stock would likely underperform. Right now, though, that clearly is not the case.  Exxon Mobil (XOM)Dividend Yield: 5%Speaking of things people use in good times and bad, gasoline ranks pretty high on the list. Sure there is a minor drop-off in consumption during recessions, as people take fewer road trips, for example, but in general, oil and gas is a safe haven business. And Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as the largest U.S. player is a true sleep-well-at-night stock.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)The combination of a fortress balance sheet, diversified operations and a storied dividend make XOM stock an excellent place to endure market storms. It may seem strange to call Exxon diversified. But what many investors don't realize is that much of big oil has spun off the other segments of their businesses.We saw a ton of refining and pipelines subsidiaries moved out of the parent companies into MLPs and other corporate entities. That is all well and good as far as shareholder value maximization goes. But Exxon's more diversified approach ensures that it remains solidly profitable even when the price of oil plummets, as it did in recent years.XOM stock is hardly the most exciting name in a high-growth market. But at 16.7 times earnings and paying a  5% dividend yield, it is a fine option for defensive investors. And buyers are still getting a fair value at this point.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned DEO, CPB, PACW, NYCB and XOM stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

Investors have been much more focused on growth as corporate earnings have pleasantly surprised, the U.S.-China trade spat showed signs of hope and the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates steady.Naturally, these more defensive companies haven't been especially red-hot of late. Consumer staples stocks have lagged the marketwide bounce that took shape beginning in late December. But with many other sectors starting to feel the weight of unwieldy gains, and with China trade talks yet again hitting turbulence, the sector might be ready to heat up again.Steve Azoury, founder of financial planning firm Azoury Financial, says, &quot;Consumer staples, the products that people use every day, will always be a big part of America's economy.&quot; &quot;The trick,&quot; he adds, is identifying the companies that &quot;will stay innovative and update their products and services to excite their customers, and thus the stock prices for investors.&quot;Here are 17 of the best consumer staples stocks to invest in at the moment. While some of these are blue-chip stocks that should ring a bell, others are lesser-known companies that serve as the backbone of brands you may be more familiar with.

Sign up here.Pernod Ricard SA reported its strongest annual earnings growth in seven years, fueled by Chinese demand, and announced a 1 billion-euro ($1.1 billion) share buyback.After sales in China surged 21%, the company is doubling down in that market by building a $150 million distillery in Sichuan province to produce single malt whisky. The company also announced the $223 million purchase of New York-based Castle Brands to add Jefferson’s bourbon to its portfolio.The positive results add steam to a distilling industry that’s been an outperformer in the wider consumer-goods sector. The revival of cocktail culture has boosted sales of high-end liquor brands such as Pernod Ricard’s Monkey 47 gin and Martell cognac.Profit from recurring operations rose 8.7% to 2.58 billion euros in the year through June, edging out analysts’ estimates. However, the company forecast profit growth may slow slightly this year to a rate of 5% to 7%.The stock rose as much as 4.6% to a record 174.25 euros Thursday.“We suspect management are being prudent, rather than this being a signal of weaker underlying trends,” wrote Trevor Stirling, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. Last year Pernod Ricard started out with the same forecast, then raised it twice.Pernod Ricard is under pressure after activist investor Elliott Management Corp. took a stake in the company late last year. The buyback follows rival Diageo Plc’s plan to return as much as 4.5 billion pounds ($5.5 billion) to shareholders.The French company also raised its dividend so that it’s now paying out 50% of earnings.“Now that we’ve significantly deleveraged our business to the lowest leverage ratio in at least 15 years, it’s the right time to clarify our strategy with shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer Alexandre Ricard said by phone of the buyback plan. He said the payout ratio has been lower over the past decade because of Pernod Ricard’s acquisition strategy.The distillery in the Chinese city of Emeishan will be the first built buy a foreign spirits maker in that country and is scheduled to begin production in 2021. Pernod Ricard hired Neri & Hu, renowned Chinese architects, to build the site, which it intends to promote as a tourist destination.(Updates with analyst comment in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Thomas Buckley in London at tbuckley25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Eric Pfanner at epfanner1@bloomberg.net, Thomas Mulier, John LauermanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pernod-plans-buyback-fastest-profit-053052642.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-19	2019-08-19 14:18:37	DEO	Diageo plc	Why I’m Still Bullish on Canopy Growth Stock for the Cannabis Long Term	There's no sugarcoating the truth here. It has been an awful few weeks for pot stocks, particularly the cannabis market leader, Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC). At the end of April, CGC stock was flying high above $50 - up 90% year-to-date, as investors were getting excited about Canopy's potential entry into the what-will-be-huge U.S. cannabis market. Two bad earnings reports later, the stock has come crashing down.Source: Shutterstock Today, CGC stock trades hands below $30 - nearly 50% off its late April highs, and up just 5% year-to-date, versus a 90% year-to-date gain back in April.If that's not a crash, I don't know what is. Indeed, the crash has been so bad that some bulls have thrown in the towel.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI get it. Stomaching a 50% crash over four months is not an easy thing to do. It does leave one feeling somewhat hopeless, dejected, and unwilling to double down.But, that's exactly what I'm doing here -- doubling down. Investors have to see the forest for the trees here. All this near-term volatility is just noise. Who really cares if Canopy grew sales by 200% or 250% last quarter? Or if gross margins were 20% or 25%? All that really matters is that Canopy continues to position itself as the profitable leader in what will one day be a multi-hundred billion dollar global cannabis market.Canopy is doing just that, and because they are, there is still visibility for Canopy to one day be a $50 to 100 billion company. CGC stock has a market cap of under $10 billion today. Thus, the long-term investment implication is simple: buy on weakness and hold for the long haul. Early Innings for Pot's Global GrowthWhen it comes to CGC stock, investors need to see the big picture here and if they don't want to do that, they probably shouldn't even be looking at the cannabis space at all. * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall The big picture here is that you have a cannabis industry that is in the top of the first inning of a multi-year, global growth narrative. Only one major developed economy has fully legalized cannabis (Canada), where it has been fully legal for less than a year, and that economy is considered one of the smaller fish in the global market. Judging the long-term fate of a cannabis company because they missed sales or earnings estimates last quarter seems … foolish.Doing so would be focusing on a tree. Instead, investors need to take a step back, and look at the forest. Here's what the cannabis forest looks like. There is an overwhelming amount of data out there which implies that cannabis consumption is: on a secular uptrend; nearly as pervasive as alcohol and tobacco consumption; and, in many instances, preferred to alcohol consumption among younger consumers.At the same time, governments around the world are becoming open to consideration of cannabis as a &quot;safe drug&quot; and are gradually progressing toward full legalization. Combining those two observations, the implication is clear: the global cannabis market will be fully legal one day, and when that happens, it will be huge -- like global alcohol and tobacco markets huge. Canopy Growth Stock Still Projects as a Long-Term WinnerThe global alcohol and tobacco markets are several hundred billion dollar to trillion dollar markets. The cannabis market will be that big one day.Each of those markets has also produced several $50 billion to $100 billion-plus companies. See Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD), Diageo (NYSE:DEO), or Heineken (OTCQX:HEINY) in the alcohol world. See Altria (NYSE:MO) and Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) in the tobacco world.The cannabis market will similarly produce several $50 to $100 billion-plus companies at scale. Canopy Growth will be one of them.Even the company's former CEO, Bruce Linton, unceremoniously booted out last month as Canopy's co-CEO and board chair, told BNN Bloomberg he was a buyer of CGC stock after the shares fell on August 15.Right now, Canopy is the biggest cannabis company in the fully legal Canadian market. It also has the largest balance sheet, with the most cash firepower to increase production capacity, expand global distribution, penetrate other cannabis markets, and invest in next-gen product R&D -- overall, sustaining and expanding its leadership position.Canopy is doing all of those things. The company's harvest amounted to more than 40,000 kilograms last quarter -- no one else in this space even comes close to touching that number. Canopy has a deal to acquire Acreage once the U.S. market becomes fully legal, giving the company a clear pathway to penetrating the U.S. market. They also poured over C$8 billion into R&D last quarter. Competitor Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) spent less than $2 billion CAD ($1.5 billion) on R&D in the overlapping quarter.In other words, Canopy is doing everything it needs to do in order to be the Anheuser-Bush or Altria of the cannabis world. Big picture, that means CGC stock remains on track to have a $50 billion to $100 billion-plus market cap one day. The market cap today? Under $10 billion. For long-term investors who are willing to ride out the volatility, the implication is clear: buy on weakness and hold for the long haul. Bottom Line on CGC StockWhen it comes to CGC stock, investors need to see the forest for the trees.True, it has a caretaker CEO after Linton fell out with shareholder Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), but there are indications that Canopy is looking at candidates from the consumer, pharmaceutical, alcohol and even technology sectors, according to BNN Bloomberg. * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond But put that aside for a minute. As well, forget today's depressed gross margins. They are depressed because Canopy is spending an arm and a leg to lay the foundation for long-term growth. Forget today's slowing growth trends. Growth is slowing because Canopy is more focused on maximizing long-term growth, not supercharging near-term improvements.Instead, understand that Canopy is laying the groundwork to become a $50 billion to $100 billion-plus company one day.I get that it's tough to do that on the heels of a 50% sell-off over the past four months. But, CGC stock is still up 5% since January 2019, 20% since January 2018, and 300% since January 2017. So, again, the best thing here is to zoom out and contextualize everything.When you do that, it becomes clear that Canopy is still a winning company, and that CGC stock still has tremendous long term potential.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long CGC.

To tap into the trend, the company behind bar staples such as Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky is increasing its stake in nonalcoholic distilled spirit brand Seedlip to majority ownership.Seedlip produces clear liquids with a similar mouth feel and complexity to high-end gin -- along with a comparable $35-a-bottle price. The brand was founded by teetotaler Ben Branson to address the challenge of what to drink when laying off the booze.Read this: These Mocktails Are No Shirley TemplesDiageo is keeping Branson onboard “to grow what we believe will be a global drinks giant of the future,” John Kennedy, who runs Diageo’s business in Europe, Turkey and India, said in a statement.The company is making the acquisition via its Distill Ventures arm, which invests in beverage startups, after buying a minority stake in 2016.

2019-08-05	2019-08-05 12:48:26	DEO	Diageo plc	10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever	[Editor's note: This story was previously published in June 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]Investing to &quot;buy and hold&quot; is trickier than it looks. The increasing pace of technological change means even the most successful, dominant companies have to continually adapt to keep up. Industries like energy, real estate and even consumer products are facing potentially significant long-term changes going forward.In any era, amassing a collection of retirement stocks simply by buying the best companies and holding them for years can be a risky endeavor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long General Motors (NYSE:GM) was a classic &quot;widows and orphans&quot; stock until the last decade when GM wound up going bankrupt. GM shares basically haven't moved in a quarter of a century. United States Steel (NYSE:X) once was a pillar of corporate America and a buy-and-hold stock. Polaroid and Eastman Kodak were once blue-chip stocks. Both went bankrupt as cameras changed from film to digital.But there still are stocks to buy and hold out there that can last forever, while offering dividend income along the way.Here are ten such retirement stocks to buy and hold forever. Bank of America (BAC)Dividend Yield: 2.45%It might seem strange to open the list with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). After all, we're only a bit more than a decade on from the financial crisis.Source: Shutterstock During that crisis, BofA acquisition Countrywide Financial blew up in spectacular fashion, after pioneering many of the risky tactics that led to the bubble and subsequent bust.But this is a different BofA.Net consumer charge-offs hit a decade-long low last year. Its performance on credit metrics is strong.  Government regulations have been criticized as slowing growth -- but they've undoubtedly lowered risk as well, even if observers might argue that a better balance is needed.  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now No less than Warren Buffett is now BofA's largest shareholder, through his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). And the Oracle of Omaha is fond of saying that his favorite holding period is &quot;forever.&quot;That seems likely true for BAC stock as well. Diageo (DEO)Dividend Yield: 2.09%Change has come to the alcohol industry, with the number of breweries exploding worldwide and new distilleries popping up as well. The brands owned by Diageo (NYSE:DEO) are well-positioned to adapt to shifting tastes.Diageo owns classic brands like Johnnie Walker whiskey, Tanqueray gin, Smirnoff vodka, and Harp and Guinness beer, among many others. What most have in common is a timeless quality and worldwide brand recognition.As a result, while beverage giants like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Anheuser Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) have struggled with earnings growth, Diageo grew net income by 13.5% in fiscal 2018 and expects consistent growth going forward.Yet with a trailing multiple of 26.5, and with a dividend yield of  2%, Diageo stock isn't all that dearly valued. Long-term investors would do well to own DEO and perhaps use the dividends to buy a bottle or two of fine whisky. Medtronic (MDT)Dividend Yield: 2.11%In this day and age, the U.S. healthcare market, in particular, seems potentially volatile. Concerns about increased spending and political battles over the Affordable Care Act create more questions than answers.Source: U.S. Embassy Kyiv Ukraine via Flickr (Modified)But even with that uncertainty, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) isn't going anywhere. The company's devices are an integral part of modern medicine, ranging from pacemakers to stents to bone grafts to imaging systems.Even the risks involved in the sector look priced into MDT. Medtronic's days of double-digit annual growth may well be behind it, but it's not finished increasing earnings or dividends. MDT stock likely isn't finished rising, either.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy Under $10  NextEra Energy (NEE)Dividend Yield: 2.37%Utility stocks are among the most common safe, buy-and-hold stocks. NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is now the largest electric utility in the U.S. by market capitalization. That might actually be the only problem with NEE stock.Source: Shutterstock NextEra shares gained 24% year-to-date, and trades just off record highs. Potential valuation concerns aside, NextEra looks like a winner. It serves customers in the southern Florida region, still one of the nation's fastest-growing areas.A 22.6 forward P/E multiple is high for the space but not outlandishly so. And a 2.37% dividend yield provides income along the way.Investors looking for value in the space might look for a smaller play like cheaper Dominion Energy (NYSE:D). But it's usually worth paying for quality, and NextEra Energy looks like one of the best utility stocks out there. McCormick & Company (MKC)Dividend Yield: 1.43%McCormick & Company (NYSE:MKC) is another quality company whose valuation might spook some investors. But MKC stock very rarely is offered cheaply.Source: Shutterstock The company's market leadership in spices and seasonings provides both an impressive moat and protection against economic downturns. MKC stock did dip after the company acquired French's mustard and Frank's RedHot sauce from Reckitt Benckiser (OTCMKTS:RBGLY) at a price that looked a bit high to many investors. But MKC has recovered those gains and then some.Top-line growth for McCormick likely isn't going to be explosive, but it will be steady. The same has been true of MKC stock, which has returned an average of 13% a year over the past decade, including dividends.  * 7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for Your Inner Geek With continuous cost-cutting initiatives, the contribution from the acquired brands and organic growth (and growth in organic products), MKC still should be able to provide double-digit annual returns going forward as well. Allstate (ALL)Dividend Yield: 1.91%Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL) long has used the tagline, &quot;You're in good hands,&quot; and it's true for Allstate investors as well.Source: Shutterstock ALL stock has almost quadrupled from late-2011 lows. And there could be more upside to come. After all, Allstate isn't particularly expensive, trading at a 14  P/E.Once any short-term worries subside, ALL should resume its march upward. International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF)Dividend Yield: 2.03%International Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF) is a company most consumers encounter every day without knowing it and many investors aren't exactly hip to it, either.Source: Shutterstock As its name suggests, the company develops flavors & fragrances across 13 categories, including cosmetics, perfumes, beverages and sweet flavors. Sales and earnings have increased consistently and so has IFF's share price. At a 53 P/E, IFF does look a bit pricey. But, as with McCormick and other stocks on this list, investors should pay for quality.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels IFF's hidden, but key role, in so many industries, gives it a great deal of protection against both competition and macro factors. Acquisitions and a growing cosmetic additive business both provide room for growth.Consumers may not know IFF, but investors should. Lamb Weston (LW)Dividend Yield: 1.19%Lamb Weston (NYSE:LW) was spun off from Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) last year. Lamb Weston is the No. 1 potato producer in the United States. In fact, it manufactures the well-known fries at McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), among other restaurant chains.Source: Shutterstock Lamb Weston also has a consumer business (including a small segment that manufactures frozen vegetables), while serving restaurants of all sizes. Health concerns might seem a long-term headwind against the business, but growth has been steady for years, and margins continue to improve.LW is targeting international markets for growth, as French fries have much more limited penetration, while international audiences generally are intrigued by Americanized products.Despite growth and leading market share, LW stock isn't particularly cheap, trading at about 19 times next year's earnings. The company did pick up a fair amount of debt in the CAG spinoff. But it's paying that debt down, which should lower interest expense and boost cash flow going forward.With many similar stocks trading at much higher multiples, LW seems to have room for upside. And international growth should offset any health-related concerns in the U.S., should they arise. America's love affair with French fries isn't going to suddenly end, and that should ensure years of stability for Lamb Weston at least. Fortune Brands (FBHS)Dividend Yield: 1.7%Investors are commonly advised to diversify their portfolio. Fortune Brands Home & Security (NYSE:FBHS) has done just that.Source: Shutterstock The company operates in four segments: Cabinets, Plumbing, Doors, and Security. Among its well-known brands are Moen in plumbing, and MasterLock in security.FBHS is more of a cyclical stock than most on this list, and the company no doubt has benefited from the steady if slow, housing recovery in the U.S.But the company's products also generate relatively stable replacement demand, and a 1.6% dividend yield provides modest, but growing, income.  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now Fortune Brands has been an impressive company since its founding and a solid stock since its 2011 IPO. There may be a bit more volatility here, but that's a worthwhile price to pay for long-term investors. There's enough value in Fortune Brands to ride out any market jitters. Republic Services (RSG)Dividend Yield: 1.83%Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) is a bit smaller and likely a lot less well-known than rival Waste Management (NYSE:WM). But in this case, that's not necessarily a bad thing.Source: Shutterstock Republic Services has outgrown its larger competitor in both sales and earnings over the past five years. RSG stock has modestly outperformed WM over the same period as well. Investors appear to believe that will continue, as Republic Services is valued a bit higher than Waste Management, at least based on forward earnings multiples.Both RSG and WM are solid long-term plays. Contracted revenue and steady demand should support both companies for years to come. There's room for further acquisitions in a relatively fragmented space. Republic Services gets the nod here due to slightly better growth and more room for margin improvement.But investors looking for safe, stable growth can't go wrong with either RSG or WM.As of this writing, Vince Martin was long MKC.

2019-07-26	2019-07-26 09:10:35	DEO	Diageo plc	Premium Spenders Are Rescuing Companies From the Mass-Market Squeeze	(Bloomberg) -- From yogurt to beer to the humble diaper, consumer companies are reaping the benefits of pushing premium products that command higher margins and give consumers a greater sense of reward.The strategy was on display this past week, among the busiest in the quarterly earnings calendar, with bellwethers from Nestle SA to Anheuser-Busch InBev NV to Starbucks Corp. releasing their numbers. The overarching theme: sales of higher-end products are outpacing their more utilitarian siblings, and companies are adjusting their portfolios accordingly to join in the rush toward what the industry calls premiumization.“The premiumization trend is very strong and the fastest growth is happening at the higher price points,” said Ivan Menezes, the chief executive officer of drinks giant Diageo Plc, which disposed of more than a dozen of its lower-priced labels like Seagram’s VO whiskey and Myers rum last year to focus on higher-end categories. “Our strategy is all about building our brands and portfolio around this trend of people drinking better, which is very broad based and sustained across geographies.”L’Oreal SA’s proposition that consumers should reach for the top shelf because they’re worth it has long set the tone of self-fulfillment through shopping. But only recently have companies across all industries embraced that mantra, realizing that younger, savvier clients demand more from a product than its immediate utilitarian purpose. Instead, environmentally sound items with a design edge and a product story that resonates with the buyer are moving into focus, and staid lines with little buzz are headed for disposal.Discounting CompetitionPart of the move is born out of pure necessity. Aside from consumer preference for more specialized products, the shift to e-commerce and the rise of discounters has made prices more transparent, making it harder to raise them. Supermarkets, particularly in battleground markets like the U.K. where Brexit is adding extra duress, have also become more aggressive in negotiating with manufacturers and competition has intensified.That pressure is largely absent at the higher end, especially in growth markets like China where consumption comes with an aspirational twist. Diageo’s most premium brands jumped almost 20% over the last year in Asia as Chinese consumers snapped up more deluxe spirits. Anheuser-Busch joined its peers to say premium is a critical component of its strategy amid surging growth at its high-end lines, which includes Stella Artois and Hoegaarden beers.Starbucks has also received a boost from higher prices, including in its two key markets: the U.S. and China. In the most recent quarter, same-stores sales jumped 7% in the U.S. coffee chain’s home market, fueled by an increase in the average amount customers paid.Companies are focusing on higher-end products at a time when economies in Europe are showing signs of sputtering, hoping that the lines’ more stable pricing power will insulate them from a probable downturn. In Germany -- Europe’s biggest economy -- the business outlook for companies tumbled to the lowest level in a decade as the Bundesbank said Europe’s largest economy shrank in the second quarter, adding to signs that the country may be inching toward a recession.‘Very Crowded’“When you look at the mass market, whatever category it is, it’s very crowded and it’s highly promotional and deflationary,” said Robert Waldschmidt, an analyst at Liberum. “It’s going to be difficult in a mass-market big-bucket category to get pricing that’s anything short of inflation matching.”And there’s no product too basic to escape the glare of premiumization. Kimberly-Clark Corp. has come up with Huggies Special Delivery, sold in a striking black box and aimed at millennial moms, in what it calls a &quot;super-premium diaper&quot; that’s softer, made with plant-based materials, and free of parabens and other harsh chemicals.&quot;The only way to make premiumization work is if you make products worth more and worth paying that premium for, and that’s what we’re trying to do,&quot; CEO Michael Hsu said on the company’s earnings call.The move upmarket means that some products in companies’ portfolios no longer make the cut. While there’s always a market for cheap, simple and basic products, being stuck between budget and premium is a place that consumer companies want to avoid, according Alan Jope, the CEO of Unilever. The company has sold its struggling spreads unit and added fast-growing businesses such as Pukka Herbs tea to its roster of brands to accelerate growth. Other moves include buying Sir Kensington’s, a brand of upmarket ketchup and other dressings, as well as premium ice-creams such the Grom and Talenti lines of gelato.Chinese Demand“In almost every country in the world, we see a bifurcation,” Jope said. “We see a growth at the value-end, and we see growth at the top end.”China, in particular, is a consumer market that’s responding well to the upmarket shift. While food giant Nestle SA noted a slowdown in the broader Chinese food and beverage market in China, premium products like infant nutrition performed well, the Swiss company said. Such lines now make up more than a fifth of total sales, a number that will continue to go rise, the company predicted.“The consumer population out there has very high expectations when it comes to quality, sustainability and taste,” said Nestle CEO Mark Schneider. “And at the same time, they’re also willing to pay for it.

2019-07-23	2019-07-23 12:49:18	DEO	Diageo plc	How Britain’s Savviest Investors Are Beating Brexit	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Since the U.K. decided more than three years ago to leave the European Union, the nation's savviest investors have succeeded by putting their money where Brexit matters least.Uncertainty about the date of Britain’s departure (now pushed back to Oct. 31) and the terms of the divorce has meant purging the U.K. from their holdings or limiting them to investments traditionally impervious to man-made and natural disasters. Over 38 months, British sterling depreciated 16 percent, the worst shrinkage for any similar period in 8 years. The pound remains the poorest performer in the actively-traded foreign exchange market and inferior to the No. 3 euro.Europe's strongest major economy in the 21st century became a shadow of its former self, reversing two decades preceding the June 23, 2016 referendum when the U.K. outperformed the European Union in growth and investment. London's stock and bond markets similarly languished as laggards to world benchmarks, after beating them consistently in the 20 years prior to the decision to leave the EU, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“If I give myself some credit, I would say that we acted reasonably fast liquidating U.K. shares” in 2016, said Ben Rogoff, whose Polar Capital Technology Trust PLC has been the most consistent winner out of the 212 British global funds with at least 1 billion pounds this year and during the past three years. His team's 114 percent total return (income plus appreciation) was 22 percentage points better than the Dow Jones World Technology Index, mostly because 68% of the fund is invested in the U.S., two-thirds of that in California companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “It's all about the Internet and where do you get exposed to the Internet? The U.S. and China,” Rogoff said last month during an interview at Bloomberg in London.While Rogoff reduced his holdings of three California tech powers during the past year — Cupertino-based Apple Inc., Menlo Park-based Facebook and Santa Clara-based Advanced Micro Devices — he acquired more shares in Shenzhen-based Tencent Holdings Ltd., Hangzhou-based Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. and Tokyo-based Yahoo Japan Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The 46-year-old graduate of St. Catherine's College, Oxford, became the lead manager of the trust in 2006, “and at that time,” he said, “the U.K. weighting might have been 5% to 10%, so if you had already been backing away to the door, it's a lot easier to escape than if you built a career around being an expert in U.K. equities.” Since the Brexit referendum, he said, “There's just been a complete buyers' strike of U.K. equities.”Proof of such disdain comes with the crisis this year at the LF Woodford Equity Income Fund, Britain's most-prized investment when it was launched by star money manager Neil Woodford in 2014. The celebrated stock picker became even more prominent with his contrarian bullish stance on Brexit. The fund plummeted 31% during the past two years by holding a combination of large and small U.K. companies and has frozen redemptions indefinitely.“It's symptomatic of a broader problem,” Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told reporters earlier this month. “Our sense is that the financial-stability risks are increasing.”One U.K. investor who’s successfully resisted the trend away from domestic stocks is Nick Train, who manages Finsbury Growth & Income Trust. It returned 61% the past three years — more than twice the FTSE All-Share Index benchmark — as the most consistent one- and three-year performer among the 129 U.K.-based funds investing mostly in domestic stocks or bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Unlike Woodford, who doubled down on the British economy writ large, Train, a 60-year-old graduate of Queen’s College, Oxford, dramatically increased his holdings in consumer staples. These are the companies that make such essentials as food, beverages and household goods and can resist business cycles because their products always are in demand.Train, who declined to be interviewed, increased the consumer staples weighting relative to the benchmark to 27% from 23% in 2015 and he enhanced his holdings of Deerfield, Illinois-based Mondelez International Inc., which manufactures and markets packaged food products, and London-based Diageo PLC, the world's largest producer of spirits and beer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.That's likely to be a safe bet as no one is counting on the British economy rebounding significantly from near the bottom of the EU while the uncertainty created by Brexit persists. “If you take a long view, then this may well be a great time to be investing in U.K. equity,” said Rogoff. “Thankfully, I don't have to make that binary call because there are very few U.K. companies I'm frankly interested in.”(Corrects location of Tencent Holdings headquarters in fifth paragraph of article published July 16.)&#92;--With assistance from Shin Pei, Richard Dunsford-White, Kateryna Hrynchak and Suzy Waite.To contact the author of this story: Matthew A.

2019-07-02	2019-07-02 16:43:11	DEO	Diageo plc	3 Consumer Stocks Loading up on Marijuana	There's no denying that investing in marijuana stocks is one of the hottest trends in the entire market. With commercial legalization around the corner, many marijuana stocks are partnering with big names in the consumer world to bring forth new commercial and medical cannabis products. Canopy Growth's (NYSE:CGC) partnership with spirit maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) was perhaps the most famous and largest of these deals.However, CGC and STZ aren't the only ones that have caught cannabis fever.There are now several other big consumer firms looking at marijuana stocks for inspiration. As we have said before, these multinational firms are a safer bet on the growth of cannabis than individual marijuana stocks. After all, their diverse product lines can provide safety from the volatility of the sector. They will still benefit from the growth and sales of cannabis-related products.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt the end of the day, it's a win-win for investors.  * The Top 10 Best Sectors in the Market for 2019 With that, here are three consumer stocks hitching a ride to rising cannabis demand. Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ)Source: Shutterstock We already mentioned how Mondelez International's (NASDAQ:MDLZ) portfolio of snack foods, cookies, and candy is a bit on the boring side. Top brands like Nabisco and Cadbury produce plenty of stable cash flows, profits, and sales for MDLZ. And thanks to their discretionary nature, the firm has been able to pass on price increases with relative ease.But that huge stable of brands could mean plenty of pin-action and growth as MDLZ pivots to adding cannabis to its products. During its last earnings call, Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put mentioned that the firm was looking into adding CBD-infused snacks to their product line.Mondelez has been working hard to expand into a variety of natural, organic and healthy snack foods. These healthy snacks come with higher margins and are one of the reasons why MDLZ has seen revenues tick higher in recent quarters. Cannabis would be a natural fit to this. Given that consumers already trust and recognize its portfolio of top brands, they could be more willing to try a Nabisco-branded CBD snack than some other unknown brand. This gives the firm an edge in actually getting people to buy cannabidiol-infused foods.While MDLZ hasn't partnered with any marijuana stocks just yet, it will be ready to make the plunge sooner rather than later, which could be great for investors. Molson Coors (TAP)Source: Drew Stephens via FlickrConstellation Brands is not the only spirit maker looking at marijuana stocks. Brewing giant Molson Coors Brewing (NYSE:TAP) has caught the cannabis bug as well. And TAP is going full-bore into the sector.Late last year, Molson Coors partnered with Quebec-based Hydropothecary Corporation (NYSEAMERICAN:HEXO). The duo formed a joint venture -- dubbed Truss -- that will primarily focus on non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages.Canada has already legalized marijuana and cannabis-infused beverages will be available in the country at the end of 2019. For Molson Coors, this is a big opportunity. The firm's size gives it a huge edge in Canada right from the get-go: TAP estimates that this drink market could be worth about $3 billion in annual sales.Molson Coors will be able to score a high percentage of much-needed revenues.In the U.S., analysis from investment bank Cowen determined that states with legal cannabis binge-drink 13% fewer times per month than non-cannabis states. The idea is that TAP can pick up revenues in Canada and then add additional revenues here in the U.S. when cannabis becomes fully legal.  * 7 Restaurant Stocks to Put on Your Plate For investors, TAP stock could be a sure thing. It already has a big foothold in key markets and should be able to boost its fortunes with its marijuana stock deal. Diageo (DEO)Source: Mustafa Khayat Via FlickrJohnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, and Guinness have served Diageo (NYSE:DEO) well over the years. These top booze brands -- along with the rest of DEO's massive staple of spirits -- have continued to rack up billions in annual sales. And they are about to get even better.DEO hasn't been shy about its intentions to add cannabis to their lineup of brands. Around this time last summer, BNN Bloomberg reported that Diageo was conducting talks with several different marijuana stocks for partnerships. A deal hasn't been reached yet, but it could happen soon.For one thing, pot stock Aphria's (NYSE:APHA) chief commercial officer, Jakob Ripshtein, was formerly the chief financial officer of Diageo North America and president of Diageo Canada. Meanwhile, spirit sales have slowed in North America over the last year. This provides plenty of impetus to get a deal done.DEO's brand range includes 14 of the top 100 premium distilled spirits brands and seven of the top 20 premium spirits brands worldwide. Like TAP and MDLZ, this huge portfolio gives Diageo a significant edge in getting consumers to actually try CBD-infused products in the first place. The best part is that these DEO brands are consumed globally.

2019-06-21	2019-06-21 12:08:40	DEO	Diageo plc	Advertisers Face Up to Scandal Risk But Can't Ditch Tech Giants	(Bloomberg) -- The advertising industry’s annual gathering on the French Riviera has become a recurring cycle of contrition from technology giants and admonishment from the Mad Men. In 2017, it was YouTube apologizing for ads appearing next to jihadist terror videos. In 2018 came Facebook Inc.’s mea culpa for a data privacy scandal. This year, Facebook regretted live-streaming a mass shooting in New Zealand and YouTube battles the spread of hate speech.All the while, the marketing money continues to flow. Facebook and Google’s advertising sales grew 38% and 22%, respectively, in 2018, and both dominated the beach front in Cannes again this year with showy largess. Google served up grape smoothies, gingerbread ice cream and live tunes from synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys and electro outfit Justice. Facebook held panels with Grammy-winning singer-songwriter John Legend and style icon Jenna Lyons, while Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg hosted some of the biggest advertisers by the shore.But the recurring scandals hitting the tech giants have created a dilemma for chief marketing officers. Do they take a principled stand and move their ad dollars elsewhere, sticking to more traditional media like TV and newspapers but missing out on the global reach and hyper-specific targeting of consumers that the platforms afford? Or do they accept the risk of being drawn into future hate speech and toxic content controversies, if it means they can keep growing sales? The consensus in Cannes this year from advertisers: let’s ride it out.“Every once in a while there’s going to be a screw-up and unfortunately the screw-ups are pretty big,’’ said Michael Roth, chairman and chief executive officer of the Interpublic Group of Cos., the world’s fourth-largest advertising company by revenue. “The thing is, it still works.”Unlike the past, when adverts were confined to spaces curated by professionals, such as TV commercial breaks, radio programs or billboards, chief marketing officers are opting to get comfortable with the daily risks of placing their products alongside non-vetted, user-generated content.In Cannes, Facebook and Google both stressed their latest efforts to keep their platforms safe, from investing in machine learning that spots offending material before it’s uploaded to hiring more humans to oversee posts. But each conceded they’ll never keep all the objectionable material at bay. Sandberg said Facebook had a ‘Herculean’ task on its hands and that generally, all technologies can be used for both bad and good.“Bad actors are smart and find ways to circumvent our policies and brush right against where the new line has been drawn,’’ said Cecile Frot-Coutaz, YouTube’s head of Europe, Middle East and Africa. “It’s that delicate balance of keeping the openness but protecting our users and advertisers.”YouTube’s latest controversy is how it keeps its service safe for children, after predators were found to be leaving pedophile comments on videos featuring kids. YouTube has previously come under fire for allowing fake or misleading content to flourish on its platform, and not removing videos with homophobic and racist remarks.Pressure isn’t just building from marketers, but also from other platforms touting their wares in Cannes to lure spending. Amazon.com Inc. hosted meetings in a top-floor suite at the five-star Carlton hotel with spectacular views over the Mediterranean, showing brands how they can advertise in Amazon search results and grow sales through its Alexa smart speaker. Snap Inc. entertained guests in a contemporary art museum, handing out rainbow-colored flip-flops. Music streamer Spotify Technology SA and Walt Disney Co.’s Hulu brought in Grammy-nominee Ciara for a VIP party at a hillside villa.Advertisers’ latest initiative to tackle the issue of safety online is a so-called ‘Global Alliance for Responsible Media’ that includes brands, ad agencies and platforms. Yet pushed at the partnership’s launch on specific measures they’d like to see, marketers from consumer-goods giant Unilever, confectionery manufacturer Mars Inc. and drinks-maker Diageo Plc weren’t forthcoming.Yannick Bollore, CEO of ad giant Havas, called it “unthinkable” not to advertise on social platforms, because that’s where consumers spend most of their time.“But we need to guarantee to our clients that we can find a positive environment,” he said in an interview in Cannes.His counterpart at WPP, Mark Read, went furthest in publicly suggesting changes that might be needed, mooting moderation of content in certain categories or limiting what can be posted from new accounts.“We need to think about the design of the platforms,” Read said, whose London-based advertising group spends billions of dollars of client money with Facebook and Google. “Clearly they haven’t done enough.”Marketers are making investment decisions at a time when the average tenure of a chief marketing officer, or CMO, is a mere 43 months, or less than half of that of a CEO, according to research by headhunters Spencer Stuart. Their short shelf-life shows the scrutiny they’re under from their boards, said Michael Kassan, founder of MediaLink, which advises the world’s most influential marketers and media companies.“The easiest way to talk is with your cheque book,” Kassan said. “But the pressure on a CMO to deliver results is intense.”And even if marketers wanted to force change through financial pressure, it’s not clear it would work. The tech giants have built a base of millions of small- and medium-sized businesses that advertise using their tools, which limits the leverage of any particular brand, said Pedro Earp, chief marketing officer of beer-maker Anheuser-Busch InBev NV.“Some of these issues are complicated and aren’t solvable like that,” Earp said, who sits on Facebook’s client council which consults on how to improve the platform for advertisers. “It’s been a constructive dialog.”But so long as Facebook and Google continue to offer marketers an unparalleled ability to reach consumers and ease of use, they’ll keep dominating the industry, said Wenda Harris Millard, vice president at MediaLink and based in London.“For advertisers it’s kind of like, ‘Do I press the F button or the G button?”’ she said. “It’s hard to stop all this.”To contact the reporters on this story: Joe Mayes in London at jmayes9@bloomberg.net;Angelina Rascouet in Paris at arascouet1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rebecca Penty at rpenty@bloomberg.net, Benedikt KammelFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advertisers-face-scandal-risk-cant-120840635.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-29	2019-05-29 13:33:07	DEO	Diageo plc	Tilray Stock Keeps Its Eyes on the Future	Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock, like other Canadian marijuana stocks, raised a lot of cash in 2018 and spawned a lot of hype. Now we will see if that cash can build a sustainable business.Source: Shutterstock Tilray got a slight bump with its recent earnings announcement -- a loss of $30.3 million, 32 cents fully diluted, on revenue of $23 million.The loss was excused by revenue being up 195% from the previous year. Tilray was finally able to do what it came to the market to do -- sell marijuana to willing adults. The company brought in nearly $7.9 million from pot sales, and nearly $5.6 million from edibles, as Canadians started enjoying the drug legally.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut this doesn't make Tilray a great investment. We don't yet know what Tilray can be. The Hype Machine for TLRY StockLast year, when Tilray and other marijuana stocks were raising money and selling dreams of pot billions, I called it Bitcoin, in that its value had no relationship to reality.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June The company went public last July with a first trade of $23.05. It was due to open May 29 at about $42.50. This means early investors have doubled their money, but those who bought the hype last fall, just like Bitcoin investors in late 2017, are out of the money.  The stock peaked at $300 but traded over $100 regularly until December.None of this has any relation to market reality. Even if Tilray hits projections of $414 million in sales for all of 2020, you're still paying 10 times book at its current market cap of $4.3 billion.Tilray has also spent the last year supplying itself with sober executives from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Diageo (NYSE:DEO). It also closed a partnership with Novartis (NYSE:NVS) that the Novartis CEO is tired of talking about.The hype machine did its job, but the get-rich-quick crowd has already sold. If you're going to make money in Tilray, it will be from real operations. Tilray and the Pot ShortageCanada, which began allowing some legal cannabis sales late in 2018, has about 37 million people. Compare that to California, which has nearly 40 million. That's a lot of market to supply, and most suppliers have had difficulty. How long the shortage lasts is a subject for debate, with some saying it's already ending.In the short run, Tilray has been focused on supply, and because it had supply it nearly doubled revenue estimates for the first quarter. Now Tilray is looking past the short-term shortage  and seeking to play in as many aspects of legal marijuana as it can.As our Vince Martin writes, Tilray is focusing on branded products -- on oils and edibles, flavorings, additives and drugs. This will let it take advantage of a supply glut whenever that happens, and it's already starting in some markets. The Bottom LineThe fortunes of Tilray balance largely on its controlling shareholder, Privateer Holdings of Seattle (headed by Tilray CEO Brendan Kennedy), and its 78% stake. they have said they won't sell any of the stock in the first half of the year.It makes sense for those who got in with pennies on the dollar to get their investment back. But other investors are right to ask whether Privateer is in this for the long term.I think they are. Tilray had over $500 million in cash on its books after a convertible debt offering late last year, enough to fund its strategy shift away from the Canadian smoking market.If you believe in a long-term future for marijuana stocks, Tilray makes sense. Just wait until the stock overhang and the hype both clear before you seek an entry point.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Several of the world’s biggest consumer goods companies are making a push into cannabis-related products, as decriminalisation spreads across North America and makes weed a potential competitive threat to cigarettes and alcohol.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/432a0640-485f-3c36-8760-ac670004cd6c/diageo-watching-cannabis.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-16	2019-05-16 13:15:06	DEO	Diageo plc	New Regime Will Impact Aphria Stock	No one who follows Aphria (NYSE:APHA stock should have been surprised that the company's president, Jakob Ripshtein,  resigned on May 14. Ever since interim CEO Irwin Simon was appointed Independent Chair of Aphria's board in December,  it was only a matter of time before Simon, the entrepreneurial founder and former CEO of Hain Celestial (NASDAQ:HAIN), would play a more prominent role at the Canadian cannabis company.  Out With the OldSimon stepped down in June 2018 from his role as CEO of Hain after years of sub-standard shareholder returns and a hard-court press from activist investor Engaged Capital.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy that Lost 10% Last Week Simon owned 1.7% of Hain's stock, but Engaged has an 11.3% stake, so Engaged's founder, Glenn Welling, was appointed to Hain's board in September 2017. Simon remained the chairman of Hain, the same role he now holds at Aphria. At 60 and in reasonably good health, Simon probably isn't ready to devote his life to the golf course and retirement. The resignation of Ripshtein, after Vic Neufeld stepped down as APHA's CEO in January, is another part of the changing of the guard at Aphria.  I expect the board to soon remove the interim tag from Simon's current title. The Irwin Simon era at APHA has begun.  The New COORipshtein joined Aphria in May 2018 as its chief commercial officer and was promoted to president six months later, before Simon arrived on the scene. While Simon's words of thank to Ripshteins in the company's press release were complimentary, it's clear by Aphria's choice for COO that Simon wasn't comfortable working with Ripshtein, a former CFO of Diageo's (NYSE:DEO) North American operations and former president of the liquor company's Canadian operations.  &quot;On behalf of the Board of Directors and Aphria team, we thank Jakob for his contributions to the Company over the past year and wish him well in his future endeavors. He has been instrumental in assembling the incredible team we are fortunate to have today that will carry his responsibilities forward,&quot; Irwin stated in Aphria's May 14 press release.The new COO is Jim Meiers, who happens to have come to Aphria after 14 years at Hain Celestial, where he  worked alongside Simon. At Hain, Meiers  hed several senior executive positions, including president of Celestial Seasonings. Before Hain, he worked at both H.J. Heinz and Kraft Foods. Meiers' hiring suggests two things.First, it's likely Simon wanted someone he could trust to execute Aphria's game plan and someone who's familiar with his style of management. Every change at the top involves a little turnover. I'm sure it wasn't personal. Secondly, Meiers' background suggests that Simon is looking to implement a supply chain which is more appropriate for a food company rather than a medical company. Both, however, require significant oversight, making the appointment a sensible one and positive for Aphria stock.  The Bottom Line on Aphria StockThe moves announced May 14 are simply part of the ongoing transformation of Aphria from Vic Neufeld's baby to Irwin Simon's. One of two things is going to happen in the coming months. Either Simon will be appointed the permanent CEO (likely) or Meiers will become the chief executive (less likely but still possible). Given the spotty performance of Hain stock over the past 15 years, I don't know if Simon's rise to power at APHA is, overall, a good thing or a bad thing for the owners of Aphria stock. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-29	2019-03-29 16:29:16	DEO	Diageo plc	7 Stocks Still Worth Buying at 52-Week Highs	If you're looking for stocks to buy, a recent stat from Investors Business Daily should provide you with plenty of ammunition. According to IBD, there were 388 stocks and ETFs at 52-week highs as of March 21 compared to just 73 lows. As I write this, on March 26, there are 49 stocks at 52-week highs trading on the NASDAQ and 153 on the NYSE for a total of 202, down from a few days ago, but still well above the 56 new lows on the two exchanges.So, while the ratio of stocks hitting 52-week highs to those hitting 52-week lows has fallen from 5.3 to 3.6, the reality is that 2019 is turning out to be much improved from the 2018 edition of the market. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo give you an idea of how improved, consider that not one of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 is down in 2019 through March 25. Seven of the 11 sectors are sporting double-digit returns with the best performance coming from Technology (up 17.8%) and the worst from Healthcare, which is down 4.7% YTD.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business If you want to join the party, here are seven stocks to buy as they hit a 52-week high. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)As I write this March 26, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has just hit a 52-week high of $103.48. Up 12% year to date and 38% over the past 52 weeks, PG has never traded this high before. Talk about a comeback. It seems like only yesterday that the company was struggling under the weight of too many underperforming brands.&quot;Less will be much more,&quot; former CEO Alan Lafley told analysts in August 2014. &quot;The objective is growth and much more reliable generation of cash and profit. We're going to be much more agile and adaptable.&quot;Analysts applauded the move to shed more than half its brands, opting to go with those generating more than $1 billion in annual revenue. While it took some time to resonate with investors, the company's move led to a 14% increase in free cash flow since 2014. Just as important, it's converting all of its net profits and then some to free cash flow, well above its seven-year average. Investors who bought this time last year are sitting on a handsome profit. Diageo (DEO)Source: Mustafa Khayat Via FlickrAs I write this, Diageo (NYSE:DEO) has hit a 52-week high of $165.53. Up 16% year to date and 26% over the past 52 weeks, DEO is sitting at an all-time high. So, what's happening to move DEO higher?Well, it seems that consumers are moving from beer to premium spirits, the company's biggest strength, and that's delivering revenue and earnings growth. &quot;We are benefiting from consumer trends where people are drinking better and want better brands and experiences,&quot; CEO Ivan Menezes told CNBC in January. &quot;People are moving to spirits and cocktails in a bigger way from wine and beer, and people are trading up for more premium brands.&quot;Case in point: Diageo's sales in China grew by 20% in the second half of 2018 with particular strength in its scotch and baijiu brands. The economy might be slowing in China, but consumers there are still shelling out for quality spirits. In the first half of 2019, Diageo's sales increased by 5.8%, its operating margin rose by 170 basis points to 35.2%, and free cash flow jumped by 30.8%.   * 8 Genomic Testing Stocks That Can Ease the Sting of Theranos  Business is strong and likely to stay that way for the remainder of 2019 and into 2020. Starbucks (SBUX)Source: Starbucks  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) hit a 52-week high of $73.19 on March 26. It's up 13% year to date and 31% over the past 52 weeks, SBUX is sitting at an all-time high. I can't remember the first time I recommended Starbucks stock for InvestorPlace readers, but I do know that I gave Howard Schultz and SBUX stock the big thumbs up in July 2013. &quot;It's coming up with new product ideas like its Refreshers line of cold beverages that use coffee innovation to drive revenues and its food business is still in the early stages of development,&quot; I wrote at the time. &quot;Yet investors have barely noticed. Despite generating some of the best results in the company's history, its stock has gained just 27% over the past 52 weeks. To me, that spells value.&quot;SBUX stock is up 98% since July 2013, an excellent return considering it hit the skids last summer, but has recovered nicely. Last April, I argued that Starbucks would be fine without Howard Schultz holding down an executive position at the company. With China keeping CEO Kevin Johnson very busy -- it's opening a new store there at a blistering pace of one every 15 hours. Whatever the latest issue is that gets investors in a twist, Starbucks always figures out how to cope. That's a trait you want in all your investments.    General Mills (GIS)Source: Shutterstock  General Mills (NYSE:GIS) hit a 52-week high of $51.93 on March 26. It's up 32% year to date and 20% over the past 52 weeks. GIS is sitting well off its all-time high of $72.77, hit in July 2016. What's worked at General Mills to get its stock on the move? It's a combination of things.First, it helps to hire a CEO who's not afraid to implement change. Jeff Harmening did just that when he was promoted in March 2017 from COO to chief executive, replacing his boss, Ken Powell, who retired after a decade in the top jobSecondly, it doesn't hurt to raise prices to offset higher costs, which keeps earnings moving higher until organic sales reignite. Lastly, and probably most importantly, General Mills' acquisition of Blue Buffalo in 2018 for $8 billion, sent the company on a completely different trajectory, one that investors have bought hook, line, and sinker.Many thought General Mills overpaid. I don't see it that way. Here's what I said about Blue Buffalo recently. &quot;I'm generally not a fan of big acquisitions because they typically don't generate the synergies and savings projected nor do they provide the expected growth, either,&quot; I wrote March 19. &quot;However, in the case of General Mills, it had to do something because its cereal business was imploding, losing almost 3% growth in revenue over five years. Investors were avoiding GIS stock as a result.&quot;  * 3 Top Tech Stocks to Trade Right Now General Mills announced strong Q3 2019 results March 20 beating the consensus estimate on both the top and bottom line. I believe this is only the tip of the iceberg. Hershey (HSY)Source: mhiguera via FlickrSounding like a bit of broken record, Hershey (NYSE:HSY) hit a 52-week high of $113.40 on March 26. It's up 6% year to date and 20% over the past 52 weeks. HSY is sitting just three dollars shy of its all-time high of $116.49, hit in May 2016. Although the stock market is going like gangbusters at the moment, there have been some rumblings recently about a recession taking hold in late 2019. If that were to happen, Hershey's ideally positioned to ride out the storm. In January, Citigroup (NYSE:C) equity strategy analyst Tobias Levkovich published a list of 50 companies whose pricing power he felt would allow them to outperform in a slowing economy. Hershey made the cut. Levkovich didn't indicate how much investors would be willing to pay for Hershey's ability to raise prices in good times and bad, but it certainly can't hurt as a foundation for considering an investment in the Pennsylvania maker of chocolate bars and candy. Two things I like about Hershey. One is CEO Michelle Buck. In 2018, I recommended Buck along with six other female CEOs, whose stocks investors should buy. I continue to recommend Hershey stock because of her leadership. Also, Hershey's board is 45% women, a very high representation compared to other members of the S&P 500. The second reason I like Hershey is it's controlled by the Hershey Trust, ensuring that short-term moves to boost profits at the expense of the Hershey legacy aren't possible. You might not like dual-class share structures, but in instances like this, they're an absolute must. Church & Dwight (CHD)Source:  slgckgc via Flickr (Modified)  Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) hit a 52-week high of $69.54 on March 26. It's up 4% year to date and 46% over the past 52 weeks. CHD is sitting at its all-time high, hit on March 26. I consider Church & Dwight to be the poor cousin of Procter & Gamble. Its brands aren't nearly as flashy as P&G's, most people wouldn't know who either Church or Dwight was and it's a much smaller company making it far less attractive to blue-chip investors. That said, it's one of my favorite stocks of all time. &quot;It buys brands with high margins and market shares, doesn't overpay for them, and then grows them organically through the process mentioned previously, all the while converting free cash flow at a better rate than anyone in the industry,&quot; I wrote in April 2016The process I speak of is Church & Dwight's three-point plan: It creates innovative new products and brand extensions, it spends considerable amounts advertising its handful of power brands, and then increases a product's distribution as extensive geographically and by type of market as it possibly can. It's hard work. Very few can do what it does.   * 4 Pot Stocks That Could Be Fizzling Out That's why it hasn't had a down year in over a decade. Ulta Beauty (ULTA)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr  Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) hit a 52-week high of $345.63 on March 26. It's up 40% year to date and 65% over the past 52 weeks. ULTA is sitting at its all-time high, hit on March 26. If you're like me and have followed the company's stock for some years, you'll remember the specialty retailer's June 2017 swoon that saw it lose more than a quarter of its value in two months. In August 2017, I recommended investors buy its shares before and after announcing Q2 2017 results, regardless of the direction of its share price. I made that call because of my confidence in the company's growth strategy.Here's how it played out. Ulta shares closed trading August 24, 2017, at $233.71 a share. It announced Q2 2017 revenues and earnings that beat analyst expectations. However, investors didn't like the slowdown in same-store-sales growth, so its shares dropped by 9.1% on the next day's trading. It then spent the next 15 months in a trading range between $200-$300. So, if you bought 100 shares of ULTA stock on August 24, 2017, at the high of $247.30 and 100 shares on August 25, 2017, at the high of $217.80, you'd be up 47% in the 20 months since. I'm not saying this to toot my own horn. Instead, I'm saying it because I believe that the earnings momentum it continues to enjoy is going to carry on into fiscal 2019 and beyond. I live in Canada.  There isn't a single Ulta store open here. The last time I looked, Canadians didn't have a problem shopping at Sephora. I doubt they'd have a problem buying at Ulta. Between Canada and e-commerce, the pathway to growth is alive and well.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-19	2019-03-19 17:53:22	DEO	Diageo plc	Kraft Heinz Needs to Do These 3 Things Right Now	I didn't think it could get much worse for Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), but it did. Standard and Poor's put the company on CreditWatch negative for failing to file its annual report with the SEC. Down went Kraft Heinz stock hitting a 52-week and all-time low.  Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf there was any doubt that KHC was in the fight of its life, yesterday's dressing down by the credit rating agency is a glaring illustration of how far it has fallen in the past 12-24 months. So, why then did I recently pen 7 Reasons Kraft Heinz Stock Is a Contrarian Buy?Because despite everything, I do believe that Kraft Heinz can be turned around -- but only if these three things are done by the end of 2019. Restore the Balance SheetCompanies that get put on CreditWatch negative are often downgraded (50% chance) within 90 days of going in the credit rating doghouse. While the optics of a $39 billion market cap getting downgraded stings, the financial implications are much worse. In the case of Kraft Heinz, it has way too much debt. As I stated in my February article about Kraft Heinz stock being a contrarian buy, the company has long-term debt of $30.9 billion and just $1.1 billion in cash. With almost no free cash flow, it's going to have to sell some of its brands to pay down debt.  * 7 Financial Stocks to Invest In Today Consider this, while Kraft Heinz's long-term debt is 79% of its market cap, General Mills (NYSE:GIS) has $12.2 billion in long-term debt or 43% of its market cap. Despite making a game-changing acquisition of Blue Buffalo last year for an eye-popping $8 billion, its balance sheet is still much stronger than Kraft Heinz's. Get that down below 50% and investors will warm to Kraft Heinz stock. Fire the CEOI read a great article recently by Forbes contributor Rober Wolcott that talks about Kraft Heinz's controlling owners, 3G Capital, needing to step up to the plate and lead with courage. Walcott wrote March 15:&quot;It's not too late for Kraft Heinz. I personally know some talented executives still with the company. Their iconic brands haven't vanished, but even icons need to continually earn relevance.…To return to growth, Kraft Heinz must turn their cost obsession into prudence and recognize that long-term prosperity requires long-term investment.&quot;Easier said than done. Once a cost cutter, always a cost cutter. However, if it doesn't want to lose investors completely, it's got to reverse course immediately. The best way to do that is to fire existing CEO Bernardo Hees, a 3G lieutenant, and replace him with someone who's got a long history of product innovation and rarely if ever worked for a cost cutter.As former Unilever (NYSE:UN) CEO Paul Polman said in 2017:&quot;Any CEO can decide to think long term. I think it is courageous leadership that is missing.&quot;Wolcott's right. Kraft Heinz is missing courageous leadership. It needs that now more than ever.  Focus on Power BrandsProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) did it. Diageo (NYSE:DEO) did. Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) has always done it. So, there's no doubt that Kraft Heinz can do it. With a little leadership, of course. First, I would identify the top brands by revenues and operating profits. There's no point putting money and effort into a brand that's only got $200 million in sales and is barely profitable. On the other hand, a brand with the same amount of revenue, but good growth prospects and higher operating profits, is worth keeping.Secondly, I wouldn't hesitate to sell both the Kraft and Heinz brands if the writing is on the wall. That said, I doubt either brand is ready for the trash bin. But don't be afraid to make the big decisions even if it means giving up part of your history. Third, I would pour more money into Springboard, Kraft Heinz's platform for growth. 3G Capital are private equity investors. They, more than most, should understand the idea of making an acquisition that becomes the foundational piece of a new growth platform. Little investments can grow into big ones over time. Think 10-20 years down the road and innovation becomes an everyday thought.  The Bottom Line on Kraft Heinz StockWarren Buffett, who I respect immensely, has fallen down on the job when it comes to Kraft Heinz. Not so much because of the losses his company's taken as a result of Kraft Heinz's deteriorating business, but because he's failed to push for change when change is so obviously needed.  * Top 7 Service Sector Stocks That Will Pay You to Own Them He's a loyal person so that might be tough but if Kraft Heinz doesn't do all of the above -- and soon -- it's long-term health is very much in question.

2019-03-18	2019-03-18 14:21:21	DEO	Diageo plc	Tilray Stock Mania Holds Its Breath as Earnings Approach	The social stigma against marijuana continues to slowly dissipate.Source: Shutterstock A construction worker's pick-up truck passed me twice during a recent walk, apparently looking for a job site, the smell of marijuana smoke redolent in the air. It's still illegal to smoke in Georgia, but that doesn't mean the illegal market isn't operating …But what about the legal market?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStock in Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), the Canadian pot company, now sits finely poised between earnings due on today after the bell and a shortage of stock to short.Tilray stock is expected to lose 12 cents per share on revenue of $14.15 million. (Earnings Whispers puts the numbers for earnings and revenue at -15 cents and $17.69mm, respectively.) But that may be less important to speculators than Tilray's efforts to create credibility with the marijuana and general investor communities.  * 7 Small-Cap Stocks That Make the Grade Consider the following: Tilray has appointed Andrew Pucher, a former managing director at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), as chief corporate development officer.Pucher joins a team that now includes former executives from Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY), Diageo (NYSE:DEO), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Further, Tilray has a partnership with Novartis (NYSE:NVS), a joint venture with Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) and a production agreement with the privately-held Authentic Brands Group.Finally, Tilray last week announced a deal to buy Manitoba Harvest from Compass Group (NYSE:CODI) for about $315 million.With all this corporate star power and deal-making, you would think Tilray would be a major pot producer. What About the Product?What product?Tilray sold no marijuana during the first two weeks after Canada legalized it in October. CEO Brendan Kennedy insisted that this will have changed by this quarter, while simultaneously announcing he bought producer Natura Naturals for $26.3 million. If all this is leaving you skeptical about the company, you're not alone …Tilray short interest recently stood at 4 million shares, 24.62% of the company's float, and there's no more available to borrow. That's why shares of a company that may report revenue of $17 million trade at a market capitalization of almost $7 billion.The other is that most of the shares don't trade, with over 78% held by &quot;individual stakeholders.&quot;  There are 79 million shares outstanding. The Marijuana MarketSpeculators are betting that over the next few years, many more U.S. states will legalize marijuana sales and are looking to legislators for guidance.New Jersey is the latest with a bill to allow recreational sales. Meanwhile, Massachusetts is getting a network of pot shops, debate has begun in Connecticut and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is pushing the issue.But despite the examples of Colorado and Washington, the path to legal pot is still not a straight line.Minnesota Republicans recently rejected a legalization effort, prospects are dimming in New Mexico and New York's move is being held up by black legislators who want specific provisions for their communities to benefit.As a result, most moves lately have been toward legalizing medical marijuana, with doctors' prescriptions and extensive regulation. Florida is moving in that direction. So is Oklahoma.All that said, marijuana remains an illegal drug under U.S. law.People are still being put in jail for marijuana offenses and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk may lose his SpaceX security clearance after being shown on video smoking pot on a podcast. Bottom Line on Tilray StockDespite the success of Colorado, where marijuana sales are now growing at only single-digit rates in the fifth year of legalization, the product remains controversial.Tilray and its competitors are preparing for an opportunity that may not come to them for years. Meanwhile, marijuana stocks have been bid well beyond fundamentals. A lot of people are cashing big paychecks, and the dream of a well-regulated American pot market remains hazy.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Some experts suggested that with U.S. GDP growth projected to slow, investors should rotate into more defensive sectors such as consumer staples and healthcare. However, others said the markets would surprise the pessimists with a robust recovery.&quot;Based on fundamentals, I don't think the pullback we had in this market was ever justified. Markets will do what they'll do. I think you have significant upside here,&quot; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equities strategist at Credit Suisse, told CNBC on Dec. 31. &quot;Therefore, we would think that the bottom has been put in this market.&quot;If you lean toward 2019 being a bounce-back year, consumer stocks are an excellent choice to ride the wave.One metric that drives the share prices of consumer stocks is the strength of the job market. If Americans are employed and their wages are growing, that will help consumer spending. Well, the U.S. has trounced expectations in two nonfarm payrolls reports announced this year (December and January), which should go a long way toward strengthening consumer spending trends.Here are 10 of the best consumer stocks to buy for 2019. Some of these stocks are more defensive in nature - better suited for a volatile year. A few others are more aggressive and could ride a bullish wave better than most.

The stock is down over 30% in the past 12 months, outstripping many others in the sector.

A lot of it came yesterday when management delivered a mediocre earnings report. Profits fell and they lowered forward guidance expectations. The stock plunged 12% on the headline.

STZ stock is now lagging far behind competitors like Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP) and Diageo (NYSE:DEO). But there is hope from several angles.

### Now the Good News for STZ Stock…

Constellation management is proven and they are not afraid to make bold moves. This is evident from their $4 billion investment in Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) a budding company (no pun intended) that competes in the cannabis sector. Clearly they are looking far out into the future. To that point, other experts agree as Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim upgraded the stock overnight.

In addition, a more encouraging tidbit of information came to light last night on CNBC. Rob Sands, who is the departing Constellation CEO, announced that he and his brother bought 1.1 million shares. So this is a huge bullish statement that the company is well on track. Else why risk $150 million?

Moreover, there is also technical hope. STZ stock has fallen into an abyss but this is also a potential area of support. Almost two years ago it broke out from these levels to start a 44% rally. It is now far below those highs but therein lies the opportunity.

These pivot zones usually create congestion because both bulls and bears will want to fight over them thereby creating the support. This combined with the facts that broke out yesterday from the departing CEO create the potential of a bottom.

The experts on Wall Street agree. Most analysts have at least a &quot;buy&quot; rating on it even though it is trading much lower than their lowest of price targets. Overnight we've seen two already defend the stock so there is clear value. I expect this to continue.

There are reasons to worry. First we still have macroeconomic headline risk from the tariff wars between the U.S. and China. Second, STZ has a small chance of catching a surprise downgrade. The longer the price is this far below target the higher the odds of analysts capitulating.

So I don't want to take any full-size position at this level so I will break the trade into two parts. First I buy the shares outright. Then to average down in a sense I will use options.

I sell the STZ Jul $115 put and collect $1.50 per contract. This is also a bullish trade which has a 90% theoretical chance of winning. If the price falls below $115 I have to own the shares and accrue losses below $113.50 per share. Long term, I am confident that I can make this position yield profit.
