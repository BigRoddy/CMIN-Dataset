2021-05-12	2021-05-12 20:21:40	SO	The Southern Company	‘Arm Waving’ Response to Hackers Makes Oil Industry Easy Prey	(Bloomberg) -- A few years back, a private equity firm hired the cybersecurity company Mission Secure Inc. to inspect its oil and gas operations in West Texas to make sure they were secure.Everyone from the facility managers to the private equity owners assumed that the plant’s computer network was “air-gapped” -- a term referring to computers that aren’t connected to the internet or another unsecured network. But when Mission Secure installed monitoring devices to check, they discovered that a worker on the night shift was connecting his Roku device to the internet to watch episodes of “CSI: Miami.”The incident reflects a historically lax cybersecurity culture in the oil and gas industry -- one that is now in the spotlight after the massive ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline snarled fuel supplies along the East Coast. The sector has long resisted cybersecurity regulation or substantial investments in part because they haven’t seen much of a need, according to industry and cybersecurity experts.The oil and gas industry, which includes the companies that own wells, pipelines and refineries, has long been a laggard in security spending and that gap has only widened in the last three years versus financial services and telecom industries, said Brian Walker, a principal at The CAP Group in Dallas, a risk advisory firm.Small energy companies spend about 0.25% of their revenue on security, compared to 0.75% for big electric companies, Walker said. Big tech companies and banks, which generate significantly more revenue, spend about 1.5%.“The industry is struggling with self motivation to initiate action to defend themselves,” Walker said, adding that there is no “real” regulation. “There is still only discussion and arm waving.”Colonial Pipeline became aware of the attack about May 7, after attackers had stolen nearly 100 gigabytes of data and encrypted at least a portion of the company’s IT network -- the portion of its network most of its employees use to check their email, review contracts or write and distribute invoices. However the company also took much of its operational systems offline – the side of the network where machines talk to machines to actually push gas up and down the pipeline. There is no evidence Colonial’s operational technology systems -- which isn’t connected to its IT system -- were compromised by the attack, the company said.A ransomware group called DarkSide is believed to be behind the attack.In a response to questions from Bloomberg, Colonial, which operates the biggest U.S fuel pipeline, defended its cybersecurity practices, saying it has increased overall spending on information technology by 50% since 2017, when a new chief information officer was appointed. Colonial uses more than 20 different and overlapping cybersecurity tools to monitor and defend the company’s networks, and its third-party investigator “has acknowledged many of the best practices we had in place prior to the incident,” according to a statement provided to Bloomberg.“Colonial Pipeline takes its role in the United States infrastructure very seriously,” according to a statement. “We had and continue to have robust protocols in place to detect and address threats proactively and reactively.”In addition to relatively meager spending on cybersecurity, the oil and gas industry is governed by different agencies and rules. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was given authority to set cybersecurity standards for electric grids by Congress in 2005. Fuel pipelines, meanwhile, fall under the jurisdiction of the Transportation Security Administration -- part of the Department of Transportation -- which has provided voluntary cybersecurity guidelines.“The power sector at least has defensible infrastructure, even if it’s not being adequately defended across the board,” said Rob Lee, founder of the infrastructure security firm Dragos Inc. “The gas sector is under-resourced and hasn’t been as high a priority for the federal government.”Tom Fanning, chief executive officer of the electric utility Southern Co. and a member of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, said it would be better if the energy sector all fell under the umbrella of the Department of Energy and had the same reliability standards. He said he worries that the problem may get worse as solar and wind get integrated into the system, making the job of avoiding cyber-attacks more complex.“Because of the interconnectedness, we need to reimagine how we work together and how we defend ourselves in conjunction with -- this is a joint relationship between the private sector and the federal government. That’s the big point,” he said.Attacks on energy infrastructure have been a persistent worry of U.S. officials for the better part of the last decade, as foreign adversaries have shown the desire and ability to do it.In 2013, for instance, Iranian hackers breached the control system of a small dam in Rye Brook, New York, but weren’t able to operate the gate that controls water levels because it had been manually disconnected for maintenance. Russia, meanwhile, has repeatedly hacked into Ukraine’s electrical system.It’s not yet clear whether the ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline will force major changes in the oil and gas industry, either with additional regulations or cybersecurity spending. David Drescher, co-founder and board member of Mission Secure, was skeptical that it would become a “digital Pearl Harbor.”“You’ve got to get the culture change at the top where the board is getting updated on their cybersecurity posture as often as production and revenues and EBITDA,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colonial-breach-exposes-cyber-weaknesses-202140275.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-26	2020-08-26 14:00:00	SO	The Southern Company	NFWF Announces $5.6 Million in Grants to Advance Longleaf Pine Habitat and Support Wildlife in Eight Southeast States	Twenty-three grants will support efforts to conserve nearly 350,000 acres of longleaf pine habitat and help recover populations of at-risk wildlifeWASHINGTON, D.C., Aug. 26, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) today announced $5.6 million in grants to restore, enhance and protect longleaf pine forests in eight Southeast states. The grants will generate more than $6.9 million in matching contributions for a total conservation impact of $12.5 million.The 23 grants were awarded through NFWF’s Longleaf Stewardship Fund, and will support conservation work in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas. Together, these grants are expected to establish more than 19,000 new acres of longleaf pine through plantings and will enhance an additional 327,000 acres of habitat through prescribed burning, invasive species removal and other forest management practices. Grantees will engage private landowners through workshops, trainings and one-on-one technical assistance to restore and maintain longleaf pine habitat on their lands.“The Longleaf Stewardship Fund brings together public and private partners to conserve one of the most biodiverse habitats in the country,” said Jeff Trandahl, executive director and CEO of NFWF. “These projects will expand and improve habitat for threatened and endangered species, as well as help foster stewardship of longleaf habitat among local landowners.”Today’s grants will also support the recovery of several rare species through translocation, captive rearing and reintroduction, including the red-cockaded woodpecker and gopher tortoise. These animals are known as keystone species, which means many other species benefit from their presence in the ecosystem. A complete list of the 2020 grants made through the Longleaf Stewardship Fund is available here.The Longleaf Stewardship Fund is a partnership between NFWF and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, International Paper’s Forestland Stewards Partnership, Southern Company, American Forest Foundation’s Southern Woods for At-Risk Wildlife Initiative, the Arbor Day Foundation, Altria Group, and The Orton Foundation, an affiliate of The Moore Charitable Foundation.The longleaf pine ecosystem once covered more than 90 million acres across the Southeastern coastal plain and piedmont. Today, it has been reduced to only about 5 percent of its historical range due to the conversion to other forest types, conversion to other land uses and fire suppression. This fire-adapted ecosystem possesses tremendous biodiversity, supporting nearly 900 endemic plant species and providing habitat for wildlife such as the red-cockaded woodpecker, gopher tortoise, indigo snake and Bachman’s sparrow, as well as important game species such as northern bobwhite and wild turkey.Longleaf forests also contribute to the United States’ military readiness by providing buffers to military training bases. They offer recreational opportunities for millions of Americans and contribute to working lands and forest-dependent economies. Longleaf forests are resilient to drought, wind, and pests, and help buffer communities from strong storms. These forests gained the conservation community's attention in the late 20th century as government agencies, non-profits and private landowners began collaborating to restore longleaf pine and reverse the loss of habitat.NFWF established the Longleaf Stewardship Fund in 2012 to support these conservation efforts. The fund combines its partners' financial and technical resources to accelerate the restoration of the longleaf pine ecosystem while implementing the Range-Wide Conservation Plan for Longleaf Pine as part of America’s Longleaf Restoration Initiative (ALRI).Since 2012, the fund has invested more than $42 million in projects that are establishing more than 120,000 acres and improving nearly 2 million additional acres of longleaf pine forest and benefit the native species that rely on those forests. The outcomes contribute to the goals of the ALRI, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year.Partner Quotes“More so than ever, I recognize and appreciate how America’s Longleaf Restoration Initiative brings communities and diverse groups together with a common purpose of restoring the longleaf pine ecosystem,” said Ken Arney, regional forester for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. “The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, through the Longleaf Stewardship Fund, has been instrumental in moving this initiative forward and has been a true partner in expanding the corresponding ecosystem services we require for survival and quality of life.”“NRCS is excited to support so many projects that not only restore our longleaf heritage and its wildlife diversity but are also foundational to rural economies across the Southeast,” said Kevin Norton, acting chief of NRCS.“DoD values its longstanding partnership with NFWF’s Longleaf Stewardship Fund and celebrates both the impressive conservation impacts to the longleaf pine ecosystem and significant benefits to national defense,” said Maureen Sullivan, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment in the office of the assistant secretary of defense (sustainment). “Ultimately, preserving the longleaf pine ecosystem sustains national defense in a number of ways, from promoting compatible land uses that provide a buffer for essential training areas, to reducing regulatory restrictions by advancing threatened and endangered species recovery. Ten military installations in the Southeast will benefit from the awarded projects, thereby enhancing DoD’s ability to test and train for current and future missions. This year through the Longleaf Stewardship Fund, approximately $11 will be spent by our partners for every dollar DoD spends, resulting in an outstanding return on investment and the accomplishment of shared goals on the landscape.”“It would be hard to overstate how important the longleaf pine ecosystem is,” said Leopoldo “Leo” Miranda, director of two U.S. Fish and Wildlife regions that encompass 11 southern states and two U.S. territories. “If you love the outdoors, you appreciate the longleaf because it provides invaluable habitat for all kinds of animals, and the Longleaf Stewardship Fund is making invaluable contributions to longleaf conservation. Deer, turkey, quail, as well as many listed and at-risk species, you name it – they call the longleaf home. If you just like to wander in the woods, what’s better than listening to the wind whisper in those long needles?&quot;“The restoration of America’s longleaf pine forest has immeasurable ecological, economic and social value,” said Sophie Beckham, chief sustainability officer of International Paper. “Through our Forestland Stewards Partnership with NFWF, we are proud to support eight of the 23 grants that will help to restore and manage thousands of acres of southeastern forestland and engage landowners in the stewardship of this important ecosystem.” “Restoring a remarkably diverse ecosystem that is deeply connected to the culture and economic growth of our region is reflective of our commitment to the communities we are proud to share with those we serve,” said Southern Company Operations Executive Vice President Stan Connally. “Conservation through the Longleaf Stewardship Fund will benefit a wide range of plants and wildlife that depend on longleaf pine habitat.”“Families and individuals own more than half of the forests across the South, making them a significant group that can contribute to the restoration of the longleaf ecosystem,” said Tom Martin, president and CEO of the American Forest Foundation. “These families care about the health of their forests and about wildlife, but they often lack the expertise and resources to take action on the ground. We are proud to contribute to the Longleaf Stewardship Fund to help empower these landowners on an important ecological issue.”“Thanks to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and its Longleaf Stewardship Fund, thousands of acres of longleaf pine and its unique habitat are being protected and revitalized,” said Louis Bacon, founder and chairman of The Moore Charitable Foundation and its affiliate, The Orton Foundation. “The Southeast’s natural resources, local economies and public health benefit immensely from this critical and highly effective public-private partnership. We are honored to be part of this group, whose unified vision is driving real and lasting change.”“We are proud to work alongside public and private partners to support this important initiative,” said Dan Lambe, president of the Arbor Day Foundation. “From providing a habitat for native wildlife to promoting long-term care of a critical forest ecosystem, restoration of longleaf pine forests will benefit our environment for generations to come.”About the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation  Chartered by Congress in 1984, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) protects and restores the nation’s fish, wildlife, plants and habitats.

2020-07-30	2020-07-30 17:09:51	SO	The Southern Company	Hackers Are Targeting the Remote Workers Who Keep Your Lights On	(Bloomberg) -- In July alone, hackers took over the twitter accounts of U.S. politicians, stole terrabytes of coronavirus research and even infiltrated the U.K.’s Premier League soccer clubs. Can they cut off your electricity, too?They’re trying. With millions of Americans now working from home –- including the people who help keep the grid running -- cyberattacks targeting the power sector have surged. In many cases, hackers use phishing emails to gain access to the computers of remote workers, looking to disable company systems for a ransom. But security experts warn that about dozen state-sponsored actors are also trying to infiltrate these networks.The pandemic has created “a once in a lifetime opportunity to get access during a time of heightened remote access usage,” said Rob Lee, chief executive officer at industrial security firm Dragos Inc. “The bulk electric system is absolutely too important to allow adversaries access. It’s a matter of public safety as well as national security.”Cyberattacks of all kinds have intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic, with hackers targeting public figures, banks, healthcare providers and others as the rise in remote work creates new access points. An assault on the power grid could have wide-ranging implications across sectors. While no outages have so far been attributed to hackers, grid companies are beefing up security amid an unprecedented onslaught that, in a worst case scenario, could trigger blackouts or damage vital equipment.“Every major company in our industry gets attacked millions of times every day,” said Tom Fanning, chief executive officer of utility Southern Co. “But it is very clear there have been no interruptions in service on the electrical side.”Even before the pandemic, hackers succeeded in infiltrating some energy infrastructure. In 2016, an Iran-based hacker gained remote access to an electric dam in New York for weeks. Earlier this year, ransomware shut down a natural gas facility for two days.The largest U.S. grid operator, PJM Interconnection LLC, recently told regulators it’s facing increasing attacks. In May, the U.K.’s grid data system was hacked, although electricity supplies weren’t affected. And in March, an attack against Europe’s association of grid operators, ENTSO-E, affected its internal office systems.“If you notice an attack going on, it’s already too late,” said Andrea Carcano, co-founder of Nozomi Networks, which provides web security services for utilities and other industries.Nozomi estimates that grid attacks have increased 35% since Americans began quarantining. That correlates with more electric-sector employees working from home. As an example, one U.S. utility that previously allowed only 9% of its power plants to operate remotely now allows 80% to do so, Carcano said.“With people working from home, there’s an increased attack surface to go after,” said Scott Aaronson, vice president of security and preparedness at the Edison Electric Institute.Off-site EmployeesIn response to the onslaught, utilities are implementing heightened defense campaigns. That includes Avangrid Inc. and National Grid PLC, which provide power in New York and New England.“We’ve increased our vigilance and focus since the start of the pandemic to ensure our employees working outside the office continue to access our systems in a safe and controlled manner,” said Edward Crowder, an Avangrid spokesman. He declined to share specific actions the company is taking, citing security.Before National Grid moved thousands of employees off-site, “we ensured that our systems could accommodate this change, and that there would be no impact to our security controls,” said spokeswoman Molly Gilson, without elaborating on particular measures the company took.PJM declined to comment on how it’s making its systems safer, but its Senior Vice President of Operations Mike Bryson told regulators in June that “PJM’s remote access infrastructure was already prepared both for the capacity needed for remote operations and for the security configuration needed to protect PJM while in remote operation.Still, intrusions can happen, and even the most tightly guarded systems can be taken down.“Yes, it could happen,” said EEI’s Aaronson. “You could get in and move laterally but it would be very, very difficult to do so without people noticing anomalies.” He said he’s been on regular calls with utilities, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House since February to share information on potential threats.U.S. HackingThe recent attacks have focused on corporate computer systems rather than the ones that run the physical operations of power plants and grids. The latter are overseen by engineers, many of whom were, until recently, isolated in strictly protected control centers for weeks at a time due to the pandemic.But it’s happened elsewhere. Hackers believed to be linked to Russia hit Ukraine’s grid in 2015, cutting power to 230,000 people. Last September, malware affected an Indian nuclear power plant. And since at least 2012, the U.S. government has worked to penetrate Russia’s electric power grid in a warning to President Vladimir Putin.“Although North America has not experienced similar attacks,” Dragos said in a January report, bad actors “exhibit the interest and ability to target such networks.” Dragos highlighted a group of state-sponsored hackers linked to Iran that have carried out so-called “password spraying campaigns” on U.S. oil, gas and electric infrastructure.“Electric sector community members should be more proactive than ever before,” Lee said. “But that doesn’t mean the public should be freaking out.”(Updates with Southern CEO comments in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hackers-targeting-remote-workers-keep-170951476.html?.tsrc=rss

He also estimated that the project’s cost would exceeded its current $17.1 billion target.It would be yet another blow for the Vogtle expansion, which began in 2009, has already doubled in price and is running more than five years behind schedule. The monitoring group’s analysis doesn’t even take into account the impact of the coronavirus. It was completed in mid-March, before Southern and its partners slashed the workforce by 20% in April after dozens fell ill.Read More: Southern Slashes Workforce at Nuclear Project Amid OutbreakJeff Wilson, a spokesperson for Southern’s Georgia Power unit, said Vogtle remains on schedule and at budget. Southern shares rose 0.9% at 9:49 a.m. in New York.“The project is continuing its strategy of utilizing an aggressive site work plan as a tool to help us achieve the November regulatory-approved dates,” Wilson said in an email. “The total project capital cost forecast remains unchanged.”Yet the monitoring group said Southern’s strategy to speed up testing before finishing much of the construction at the plant led to inefficiency and higher costs, according to the report. The company “erroneously concluded that deviation from normal industry practice would shorten the schedule,” Grace said.The staff of Georgia Public Service Commission also disputes more than $1.2 billion in costs that Southern plans to pass along to customers immediately after the completion of Unit 3 of the project, according to separate filed testimony. The utility wants to start recouping $2.3 billion of costs in rates in the month after Unit 3 begins operation.Shares of Southern are down about 8% this year, compared to the S&P 500 Utility Index’s 5.8% decline.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southern-nuke-project-highly-unlikely-004537289.html?.tsrc=rss

For a de-risked portfolio and solid dividends, utilities stocks are a time-tested favorite investment option.Along with the dividends, utilities stocks are considered relatively safe because they provide power to homes and businesses. This is considered a necessity that never goes out of style.  * 7 Sluggish Stocks Hit Hard by Coronavirus This Earnings Season It's a sound policy to stick to the best companies in any sector. When it comes to utilities companies, five names are well-regarded and have a long history:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK)  * Southern (NYSE:SO)  * Dominion Energy (NYSE:D)  * Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED)  * Excelon (NASDAQ:EXC)Feel free to explore these utilities stocks and see if they deserve a place among your low-volatility holdings. Utilities Stocks to Buy: Duke Energy (DUK)Source: jadimages / Shutterstock.com Like just about every company in the United States, Duke Energy is dealing with the Covid-19 crisis. This particular company seems to be taking the situation in stride, however.Consider Duke's first-quarter net income, which came out to $899 million. That's just about exactly in line with the same quarter of the previous year, when Duke's net income was $900 million. Meanwhile, this year's first-quarter revenue totaled $5.95 billion, which is not too far below the $6.16 billion reported in the first quarter of the prior year.So, while there is some pressure being felt during the pandemic, it's not too severe. For the time being, DUK stockholders can ride out the crisis with a decent 4.54% forward annual dividend yield. Southern (SO)Source: Shutterstock ""Critical infrastructure businesses like ours never take a day off,"" observed Thomas A. Fanning, the president and CEO of utilities giant Southern. Fanning's 100% right about that as Southern is an essential utilities provider for around 8 million customers.Southern remains in good fiscal health, as well. For 2020's first quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings per share of 78 cents. That's an eight-cent year-over-year increase as well as 6 cents greater than the company's estimate.  * 10 Best High-Growth Stocks to Buy for Young Investors SO stock is a safe bet since it has such a massive presence and is crucial to people's standard of living. It's also a dividend achiever with a forward annual yield of 4.78%. All in all, this pick deserves to be on anyone's top utilities stocks list. Dominion Energy (D)Source:  Riccardo Annandale Via UnsplashIf you said that D stock is recession-proof, you'd by exaggerating but only slightly. The shares have held up fairly well during the novel coronavirus crisis. Besides, the 4.77% forward annual dividend yield is a strong incentive to hold the stock.Fiscally, Dominion Energy has held up reasonably well despite the pandemic. For the first quarter of this year, Dominion reported total revenues of $4.5 billion. That's actually a marked improvement over the revenues of $3.9 billion Dominion generated in the year-ago quarter.With over 7 million customers across 20 U.S. states relying on Dominion for their energy needs, this company's a mainstay in the utilities sector and D stock is a highly reliable income generator. Consolidated Edison (ED)Source: Shutterstock Like to invest in companies that have been around for a while? If so, take a look at Consolidated Edison, which was founded way back in 1884. If you happen to reside in New York or New Jersey, there's a fair chance that your electricity service is provided by this esteemed company.Has ""Con Ed"" been able to weather the Covid storm? The answer would be yes as the company's adjusted earnings for the first quarter totaled $451 million. That's $1.35 per share and it beats the $448 million, or $1.39 per share, generated during the same quarter of last year.  * Missing copy for url 1. Please edit.  * Url 1 is an external link. Please edit.Plus, ED stock features a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 18.15 and a forward annual dividend yield of 4.32%. Those are nice stats and this stock should perform well even in these challenging times. Excelon (EXC)Source: Shutterstock This one's a little bit different from the other utilities-sector stocks on this list. Excelon is a relative newcomer, having been incorporated in 1999. Plus, EXC stock is the only name on this list that's traded on the Nasdaq.So, it could be argued that Excelon is a more ""modern"" utilities company. Its true strength, however, is that it's diversified with fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar segments.With 87 cents per share in operating earnings for 2020's first quarter, Excelon remains on par with its results from the same quarter of last year. Additionally, a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 13.79 and a forward annual dividend yield of 4.17% indicate a compelling value with EXC stock.David Moadel has provided compelling content - and crossed the occasional line - on behalf of Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, Finom Group, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

The theory: If you're invested in a mix of dividend stocks, bonds and even a few growth stocks, your money should last across a 30-year retirement.But today's world is different. Interest rates and bond yields have been stuck in the basement for far too long, reducing future expected returns. Compounding the problem: Americans are living longer than ever before.If you're wondering how to retire without facing the uncomfortable decision of what securities to sell, or questioning whether you are at risk of outliving your savings, wonder no more. You can lean on the cash from dividend stocks to fund a substantial portion of your retirement. In fact, Simply Safe Dividends has published an in-depth guide about living on dividends in retirement.Many companies in the market yield 4% or more. And if you rely on solid dividend stocks for that 4% annually, you won't have to worry as much about the market's unpredictable fluctuations. Better still, because you likely won't have to dig into your nest egg as much, you'll have a chance to leave your heirs with a sizable portfolio when the time comes.Here are 20 high-quality dividend stocks, yielding on average above 4%, that should fund at least 20 years of retirement, if not more. They have paid uninterrupted dividends for more than 20 consecutive years, have fundamentally secure payouts and have the potential to collectively grow their dividends to protect investors' purchasing power over time.

2020-02-03	2020-02-03 11:00:00	SO	The Southern Company	Clean Power So Cheap a Staunch Defender of U.S. Coal Went Green	(Bloomberg) -- Thomas Fanning, the leader of one of the nation’s biggest utilities, once railed against “the war on coal.” Now he’s on a very different bandwagon, part of the low-to-no-carbon crew.It’s a shift that bows to a new reality as natural gas and solar prices fall and climate change fears rise. “One of the riskiest things a company can do in this kind of environment is not to change,“ said Fanning, the chief executive officer of Southern Co., the Atlanta-based utility that generates enough electricity to power a country the size of Australia.The economic winds are so strong that even many of those who stridently resisted the transition to cleaner energy are converts. Coal fueled more than half of Southern’s power in 2011, when Fanning argued in Washington that limiting its use would “negatively impact the nation’s economic well being.” Today just 22% of Southern’s power comes from coal and the company is a top solar supplier.That doesn’t put Southern at the top of charts, though. Its use of coal didn’t drop below the industry average until last year, and the 12% of its power that came from renewables in 2019 was below the 17% industry average.Fanning, 62, said in an interview that Southern is seeking to find the right balance of options to move forward. He remains opposed to regulating coal and doesn’t approve of clean energy mandates. But he described himself as always having been “one of the leading spokesmen in the industry for ‘all of the above,’ resilience -- the need for innovation, and for thinking about how to create a future,” adding he’d never characterize himself or Southern as being “coal-centric.”Southern’s 2016 acquisition of PowerSecure made it the nation’s largest developer of microgrids in a move into distributed generation. But the company is also heavily involved in researching carbon-capture technologies for natural gas, he said, as well as hydrogen for fuel cells.“We’re the first company I think that came out and said ‘low-to-no’ carbon by 2050,” he said.Critics say Southern still needs to pick up the pace. Karl Rabago of the Pace Energy and Climate Center says Southern has taken advantage of its monopoly powers and friendly regulatory environment to continue squeezing profits from coal and delaying a final transition into renewables. Meanwhile, its Alabama franchise is accused by environmental groups of overcharging customers with rooftop solar panels, deliberately discouraging new installations and avoiding competition.“Resisting market forces can be profitable if you enjoy a monopoly,” Rabago said. “The fundamental question for Southern is how long can its operating companies forestall what’s some think is inevitable or how successfully can they absorb those inevitabilities and transmogrify them into a Southern’s version.”‘Clean Coal’At the same time, Southern’s bets have at times produced pain for shareholders and ratepayers.Over the past decade, the company spent billions in a first-of-its-kind “clean coal” power plant in Mississippi that was abandoned after construction delays and cost overruns. The carbon-capturing technology behind the so-called Kemper project -- which was flagged by Trump as a way to help save mining jobs -- worked just fine but became uneconomic as natural gas prices plunged, Fanning said.The company is also spending over $8 billion on a last-remaining U.S. nuclear project critics say will saddle customers in Georgia with expensive energy bills. The so-called Vogtle units 3 and 4, the first new reactors ordered in the U.S. in decades, have doubled in price and are currently running more than five years behind schedule. The spending spree forced Southern to sell assets including its Florida utility.Sill, over the past year, Southern’s shares have jumped 45%, outpacing the 22% gain for the industry benchmark, as fears that the company wouldn’t be able to complete the Vogtle project faded amid progress reports.Sophie Karp of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. in January raised its recommendation on the stock, saying it’s still cheap relative to main rivals. Once America’s largest utility company, Southern has now a market value equivalent to less than 60% of that for renewables powerhouse NextEra Energy Inc.”We’re not only reacting to a future, we’re trying to invent the future,” Fanning said.&#92;--With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich.To contact the reporter on this story: Gerson Freitas Jr. in New York at gfreitasjr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Ryan at jryan173@bloomberg.net, Reg GaleFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clean-power-cheap-staunch-defender-110000180.html?.tsrc=rss

FERC in January 2018 approved PennEast's request to build the pipeline from Pennsylvania to New Jersey, and the company promptly sued in federal court under the U.S. Natural Gas Act to use the federal government's eminent domain power to gain access to properties along the route.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-ferc-sides-penneast-natgas-201919495.html?.tsrc=rss

It means these stocks have decided to take some of their net income and deliver it back shareholders on a regular basis.It means their businesses aren't run for the most growth, but for steady long-term wealth accumulation. Yes, the stocks rise and the companies grow, but some of that cash for expansion is returned to shareholders on a regular basis.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome industries are famous for their income -- real estate investment trusts, utilities, master limited partnerships. But usually, mature companies where explosive growth is no longer the driving force, are the most solid dividend payers. At my Growth Investor service, we own a stable of these companies in our Elite Dividend Payers portfolio.Here, while my Portfolio Grader found plenty of &quot;A&quot;-rated dividend stocks, I wanted to pick stocks that also delivered reliable dividends that would beat inflation as well.  * Invest in America's Most Trusted Brands With These 7 Stocks to Buy These seven &quot;A&quot;-rated dividend stocks to depend on all fit that bill except one, where growth is just too tempting to pass up, so its yield is a little light. Dividend Stocks to Buy: Southern Company (SO)Source: 360b / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.6%Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is the second largest utility in the U.S. It runs the power companies for Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama. It also has extensive natural gas operations up and down the East Coast.It's the only utility in the U.S. that is building a new nuclear facility. Then its project management partner and nuke builder Westinghouse went bankrupt. That meant Southern had to take over the entire project.And it has done well. While the completion date has been pushed to 2021 or 2022, things are moving along on schedule.On the growth side, its massive natural gas distribution business as well as its renewable energy business are doing very well. And it's one of the best-run utilities out there.With a 3.6% dividend and 12-month return of 46%, SO stock is a rock-solid pick for any portfolio. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.4%Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has been in business since 1837.Wrap your head around that. It has been around for more than 150 years. Martin Van Buren was president when PG launched in Ohio. J. P. Morgan was born that year. There were still border wars with First Nation tribes.When you have been around that long, it means you're doing something right from the boardroom down to the products.Now, there have been some challenges of late, as new generations of less brand-conscious consumers have hit the markets and PG had to readjust its product portfolio.But it is finally through that transition. PG has raised its dividend every year for the past 60 years. That is an accomplishment few stocks can make. And it's that kind of focus on shareholder value that makes this unique.  * The 7 Stocks That Cautious Investors Should Sell Now The 2.4% dividend may not be huge, but it's consistent. And its 33% stock gain in the last year is also a nice kicker. However, if you do also want growth in your portfolio, there are better places to find it going forward. Equity Residential (EQR)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.7%Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) is a Chicago-based real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in upscale apartments in some of the top cities in the U.S. You can find its properties in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Washington, D.C., Boston, Seattle and more.In these types of cities, many people that work for big firms receive relocation allowances to find a place to live until they can settle in. Some firms even lease apartments and allow their employees to use them if they're in town on long-term assignments.That makes these cities' real estate needs unique. And that is a good thing for a niche player like EQR. It can keep its occupancy rate high, as well as its rates, because it offers top locations and quality accommodations in strategic cities.Now that prices in many of these cities have become incredibly expensive, renting has also become a real option for residents that want, and can afford, the convenience of downtown locations.The stock is up 18% in the past year and has a solid 2.7% dividend. Dominion Energy (D)Source: ying / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 4.4%Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) is one of the leading utilities in the country. It can stretch its roots back to 1795, but in its most recognizable form, it's been around for a century.It supplies electrical power to Virginia (which is part of the internet backbone, houses the Pentagon and one of the largest shipbuilding plants in the world) and also has an extensive natural gas production and distribution network that covers the Eastern seaboard and beyond.Dominion also has a number of wholesale power generation plants that extend into the Midwest.Its Cove Point plant in Maryland is being converted from a natural gas import hub to an export port for liquified natural gas (LNG). It will be one of the few on the East Coast and will see a significant rise in business as export restrictions on LNG fall. Oil-and-gas logistics are actually a theme we're profiting from within our Growth Investor buy list.  * 10 Stocks to Buy as the 2020 Presidential Election Approaches But overall, D is a solid, successful company that offers few surprises. And that's a good thing for an income stock. In the past year Dominion stock was up 21%, and it continues to deliver a rock-solid dividend, now yielding 4.4%. Leidos (LDOS)Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.3%Leidos (NYSE:LDOS) isn't throwing off a staggering dividend yield, at 1.3%. But this is a growing, dynamic company that is well positioned for the future of defense and security in the U.S. and beyond.It has a storied history that stretches back to 1969. And it has been a private contracting institution since its early days. It has worked on some of the biggest scientific challenges the U.S. government has come up against in the past 50 years.And now, it is focused on aerospace technologies. A recent $1.7 billion merger with aerospace firm Dynetics was announced just a month ago.This put LDOS in prime position for all the space work that is heating up both on the government side -- the Space Force -- and the private side -- the big defense contractors that build the equipment for the government.As a smaller player in the aerospace and defense sector, it can leverage its growth because it is more concentrated.But given the fact that all the major industrial powers now have active aerospace programs, this is the next frontier. And LDOS is already a reliable partner.And while the dividend isn't a big driver, the fact the stock is up 80% in the past year yet sits at a price-to-earnings ratio of 22 means that growth is just beginning. Carlyle Group (CG)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.6%Carlyle Group (NASDAQ:CG) is one of my favorite companies when it comes to foundational stocks that deliver solid dividends.It's a private equity firm that continues to draw exclusive clients from the corridors of power around the world. The kind of people and families that make decisions that make business happen.You know, royal families from the Middle East. Political dynasties in the U.S. World leaders from around the globe.But CG has always been discreet. It does deals, makes its money, disburses it to shareholders and keeps a low profile in a business that is often just as much about headlines as assets under management. It's the kind of business that deserves consideration for any Growth Investor.It's a steady hitter, not a swing for the fences kind of operation.  * The 10 Best Value Stocks to Own in 2020 But it certainly delivers for shareholders. In the past 12 months, CG stock was up a stunning 95%, yet it continues to deliver a bountiful 3.6% dividend. And it has done all this with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of … 12. PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (PMT)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 8.1%PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (NYSE:PMT) is one of my favorite stocks now because it's well positioned for all the good things happening in today's economy.With interest rates low, a solid economy, low unemployment and confident consumers, the housing market is well positioned for strong growth.PennyMac is a great way to play this trend.It doesn't own properties, it manages the mortgages of residential properties. It originates them, manages them, bundles them and resells them.Plus, it's set up as REIT, which means it is obligated to pay its net income back to shareholders, and it chooses to do that via its hefty dividend of 8.1%. Plus, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act now allows REIT investors to deduct 20% of their dividend. Then, the remainder is taxed at the shareholder's marginal rate. Check with your tax professional for more details.The stock is up a solid 19% in the past year and it still trades at a single-digit P/E.That being said, in the big picture, there's been a major development in the technology field I'm especially keen on now: artificial intelligence (AI) The AI Master KeyIf artificial intelligence sounds futuristic, even far-fetched -- well, keep in mind, you're already using it every day. If you've ever used Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Assistant or Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri … if you've had Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) recommend a movie or Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) recommend a house … even an email spam filter … then you've used artificial intelligence.In this new world of AI everywhere, data becomes a hot commodity.As scientists find even more applications for artificial intelligence -- from hospitals to retail to self-driving cars -- it's incredible to imagine how much data will be involved.To create AI programs in the first place, tech companies must collect vast amounts of data on human decisions. Data is what powers every AI system. As one AI researcher from the University of South Florida puts it, &quot;data is the new oil.&quot;To cash in, you'll want the company that makes the &quot;brain&quot; that all AI software needs to function, spot patterns and interpret data.It's known as the &quot;Volta Chip&quot; -- and it's what makes the AI revolution possible.You don't need to be an AI expert to take part. I'll tell you everything you need to know, as well as my buy recommendation, in my special report for Growth Investor, The A.I. Master Key. The stock is still under my buy limit price -- so you'll want to sign up now. That way, you can get in while you can still do so cheaply.Click here for a free briefing on this groundbreaking innovation.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

And high-yield dividend stocks are a critical component of executing this strategy.Financial adviser William Bengen devised the 4% rule after evaluating stock and bond data across several decades and discovering that a pattern of 4% yearly withdrawals provided reasonable security without bleeding a portfolio dry for at least 30 years, even through occasional market downturns.The concept is simple: Draw down 4% of the portfolio value in the first year of retirement, then a matching amount (adjusted for inflation) in each subsequent year. Bengen himself later updated the number from 4% to 4.5%.It's a good starting point for planning a comfortable retirement, but investors must consider a couple factors when applying it. For instance, the 4% rule doesn't account for big one-time purchases that might push your spending growth above the rate of inflation. It also assumes future market performance will resemble past results.That said, income from your investments can count toward that amount, so if you draw a high (and preferably growing) yield from your portfolio, it means you'll only need minimal price appreciation to remain on track.Here are 14 high-yield dividend stocks to buy that yield 4% or more. These picks have other qualities that are beneficial to retirees, too - some feature much lower volatility than the broader market, and many are consistent dividend raisers whose payouts may keep up with or even outrun inflation.

2019-10-14	2019-10-14 10:45:07	SO	The Southern Company	6 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy Now	[Editor's note: &quot;6 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy Now&quot; was previously published in September 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]  From continuing concerns about the China-U.S. trade war to worries about the yield curve inversion, the stock market still faces many steep risks.America's political situation hasn't been this tense in decades. The EU is facing a host of challenges, and there's always volatility lurking somewhere.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdd it all up, and things could easily get volatile quite soon. That leaves investors wondering where they can go for safety.After years of tech outperforming everything, the problems facing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have many people bailing on those stocks  as well.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 That leaves safe-haven dividend stocks as a more favorable alternative. Here are six worth taking a look at. Diageo (DEO)Dividend Yield: 2.10%Rain or shine, good economy or bad, people like to drink alcohol. And for safe dividend seekers, that makes Diageo (NYSE:DEO) an ideal play. While its name may not be familiar, its brands almost certainly are. Diageo owns and manufactures Guinness beer, Captain Morgan rum, Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker whiskey, among many others.  Source: Puamella via Flickr (Modified)DEO stock is a well-known safe haven for investors. The company is headquartered in the U.K. and was one of the very few stocks to go up the day after Brexit in that country as British investors sold risky stocks and moved to safety. Diageo will again serve as a safe haven whenever the next bear market/recession hits.Diageo isn't just a great business, it's also a great dividend play. The company has continuously raised its dividend (as measured in its home currency of British Pounds) each of the past 20 years. Campbell Soup (CPB)Dividend Yield: 3%Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB)  is one of the unloved packaged-foods makers. It's not hard to see why, if you only think about the company's name. Canned soup certainly isn't trendy with younger consumers at this point. And there's a general nutritional wariness about heavily salted foods.Source: Shutterstock That said, there's much more to Campbell Soup than just the iconic red cans. The company is more and more a snack food play. As we know, while Americans profess an interest in healthier eating, they still love their junk food from time to time. Campbell's, owner of Hanover, Pop Secret, Goldfish and Pepperidge Farm, is in a great position to profit off of this.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 Pepsico (NYSE:PEP), the leader in snacks, consistently gets a high P/E ratio from the market, as investors acknowledge the stickiness of their brands with consumers. The market, however, is not appreciating Campbell Soup as much. Shares are down from $50 in 2017 to $47 now. PacWest Bancorp (PACW)Dividend Yield: 6.6%After investors dumped bank stocks late last year, a lot of value has been created in this generally overlooked sector of the market, where solid dividends abound.Source: Shutterstock That brings us to PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW), which offers a more-than 6% dividend yield at the moment. Headquartered in Los Angeles, PacWest is a major player throughout the California market and currently sports a $4 billion market cap. That puts it in a sweet spot, size-wise, where it may still be a buyout candidate, but it is large enough to manage the rising costs of regulation and banking technology costs.Despite the horrid state of the California housing market in 2008, PacWest survived the crisis. In fact, its shares never came close to zero during the panic. The bank has come out stronger, and is now generating record profits. Thanks to the corporate tax cuts in particular, PACW stock is now at a cheap P/E ratio of just 9.4 times its trailing earnings. New York Community Bancorp (NYCB)Dividend Yield: 5.22%Despite its large yield, New York Community Bancorp (NASDAQ:NYCB) is an even safer bank stock. NYCB stock currently yields 5.2%, and they earn more than enough to cover the dividend, with earnings coming in at around 79 cents and dividends at 68 cents annually.  NYCB stock was down 12% last year because the sector was down, as discussed above. Over the last few months, though, it has fought its way back to the levels it traded at before the fall. That's why the bank is one of the safest in the country. It lends primarily against multi-family homes in New York City, one of the lowest-risk lending markets out there.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 The bank's loans barely budged in performance even during 2008. With a strong dividend covered out of earnings and a safe loan book, investors can earn a large dividend income from a most conservative bank. Southern Co (SO)Dividend Yield: 4%In the worst of times, people tend to still want to use electricity. Even a severe economic downturn tends to not impact utility stocks too dramatically. As such, it's a sound sector to buy when investors get panicky, such as what we're seeing with the market now.Source: Desiree Kane via FlickrSouthern Co (NYSE:SO), as one of the highest-yielding large power utilities, checks the boxes for safe dividend stocks here. SO stock is currently yielding 4%.Its high yield is in large part, it seems, due to interest rates having gone up. Many investors treat utility stocks as substitutes for bonds. As such, when interest rates go up, investors demand a higher yield from their utility stock as well. If interest rates were to keep surging for years to come, SO stock would likely underperform. Right now, though, that clearly is not the case.  Exxon Mobil (XOM)Dividend Yield: 5%Speaking of things people use in good times and bad, gasoline ranks pretty high on the list. Sure there is a minor drop-off in consumption during recessions, as people take fewer road trips, for example, but in general, oil and gas is a safe haven business. And Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as the largest U.S. player is a true sleep-well-at-night stock.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)The combination of a fortress balance sheet, diversified operations and a storied dividend make XOM stock an excellent place to endure market storms. It may seem strange to call Exxon diversified. But what many investors don't realize is that much of big oil has spun off the other segments of their businesses.We saw a ton of refining and pipelines subsidiaries moved out of the parent companies into MLPs and other corporate entities. That is all well and good as far as shareholder value maximization goes. But Exxon's more diversified approach ensures that it remains solidly profitable even when the price of oil plummets, as it did in recent years.XOM stock is hardly the most exciting name in a high-growth market. But at 16.7 times earnings and paying a  5% dividend yield, it is a fine option for defensive investors. And buyers are still getting a fair value at this point.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned DEO, CPB, PACW, NYCB and XOM stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

2019-08-20	2019-08-20 17:54:28	SO	The Southern Company	3 Great Active Mutual Funds for the Current Environment	There's a lot of debate over using active mutual funds versus their passive cousins. Much of that debate has low-cost index ETFs and mutual funds winning the fight. The truth is, most active mutual funds and their managers tend to underperform passive vehicles such as the iShares S&P 500 Index (NYSEARCA:IVV).However, investors shouldn't be so quick to throw away active mutual funds from their portfolios. There are situations when being active can pay some serious benefits. This is especially true in a volatile and rocky time such as this.For one thing, active funds don't have to stick to a certain basket of stocks. They can flee to cash when the market gets rough to avoid losses. At the same time, they can use down days to scoop up bargains. Moreover, multi-asset and go-anywhere funds don't have to stick out in stocks. They can go get a good return in any asset class -- stocks, bonds, you name it.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential The reality is, there are plenty of reasons to go active when the market gets wonky like this. Ignoring active mutual funds could be a recipe for disaster when volatility spikes and the market trends downwards. And with that, here are three top active mutual funds worth buying today. BlackRock Global Allocation Fund (MDLOX)Source: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.com &quot;Unconstrained in search of opportunity.&quot; That's how the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund (MUTF:MDLOX) bills itself. For nearly 30 years, the team at MDLOX has been combing the world's markets in search of better returns and they have succeeded in spades.With nearly $26 billion in assets, MDLOX is one of the largest go-anywhere mutual funds on the planet. Its wide-sweeping mandate allows it to buy stocks and bonds from nearly 40 countries as well as plenty of non-traditional asset classes.The fund's investment committee of more than 29 individuals aligns its portfolio with their general macroeconomic predictions.  This has the fund changing its holdings as the market shifts direction or the managers see opportunities. In this case, a shift towards volatility and lower global economic conditions have it allocating more towards U.S. fixed-income assets of quality. Currently, the fund has roughly 65% of assets in stocks and about 30% in bonds.However, this could and will shift if the overall global economic situation changes.MDLOX's mandate has served investors well. The fund has long held a Morningstar Bronze Medal as well as top scores from Lipper. This has translated into some strong returns for the fund. Since its inception in 1994, the fund has managed to score a 9.74% average annual return. The best part is that it has managed to do just that with lower overall volatility than the S&P 500.In the end, MDLOX is a wonderful core active mutual fund for investors and it has proven itself over time. Expenses run 1.08%- or $108 per $10,000 invested. Many brokerages offer it without a sales charge and low minimums. T. Rowe Price Equity Income (PRFDX)Source: Shutterstock Dividends remain a great way to beat market volatility and get through the current environment. It's here that active mutual funds can shine. As the market dips, yields on quality dividend stocks go up. Active managers can snag these higher yields and quality stocks often on the cheap. A great fund to take advantage of this fact is T. Rowe Price Equity Income (MUTF:PRFDX).PRFDX focuses its attention on large-cap stocks here in the U.S. that pay dividends. However, the focus isn't just on headline yield. Manager John Linehan and his team are value investors at heart, and put more emphasis on quality over quantity. To meet the test, stocks have growing revenues, low debt levels and improving profit margins to be considered. Particular attention is made to price paid -- P/E, P/B, P/S ratios -- for shares. This conservative value investment approach is specifically done to limit potential downside and volatility over time.This focus on quality and value creates a rather concentrated portfolio. The fund stretches its nearly $21 billion dollars over just 127 different names including Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), utility Southern (NYSE:SO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).The focus on quality dividends has also worked wonders in the returns department. Over the last ten years, PRFDX has managed to return over 12% annually. With a big part of that return coming from dividends. And with the fund adding value over its benchmark in the recent bouts of volatility this year, it's worthy of a portfolio addition.  * 10 Mid-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Expenses for the active mutual fund run at just 0.64%. Nuveen Preferred Securities and Income Fund (NPSAX)Source: Shutterstock With everyone running to safety these days, bond yields aren't exactly returning anything. Right now, you can score a 10-year Treasury bond paying about 1.67% in interest payments. That's not great at all. But holding too much in equities could make for a bumpy ride. The best bet? Combine them in preferred stock.Blending both attributes of equities and bonds, preferred stock provides a happy medium of high returns and lower risk. One of the best active mutual funds to dabble in the sector is the Nuveen Preferred Securities and Income Fund (MUTF:NPSAX).NPSAX combs the full gamut of preferred stocks to find values. That includes common $25 par issued retail preferreds as well as institutional $1,000 par valued stocks. Moreover, the team at Nuveen will search for deals across the entire credit spectrum and even internationally for bargains or high yields. the idea is to optimize value and create a balance between risk and reward. That has worked wonders for the active mutual fund -- with NPSAX gaining an annualized 9.66% per year over the last decade. That's pretty close to the broader market's return over that time and it came with far less volatility.There are other benefits to owning the fund as well. For one thing, NPSAX pays its dividend monthly. Even better is that dividend could be tax-advantaged for many investors. Most preferred stock dividends are considered qualified. This allows them to come in at 15% tax rate. This allows many investors to score a high monthly income -- currently a 4.82% yield -- at a low tax rate.With a Morningstar four-star rating and a low expense ratio of 0.78%, NPSAX offers one of the best active mutual funds to ride out the market's current storm with ease.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-07-31	2019-07-31 11:24:57	SO	The Southern Company	3 Big Stock Charts for Wednesday: Southern Co, CF Industries Holdings and National-Oilwell Varco	It was much worse at one point during the day, but even with Tuesday's partial bounceback, the S&P 500 closed down to the tune of 0.26%. Investors remain hesitant to do much of anything until after they've had a chance to chew on today's interest rate decision and rhetoric.Source: Shutterstock Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) led the charge lower, losing another 6.4% of its value as investors continue to jeer the decision to sell its Upjohn arm to rival Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL). Mylan, meanwhile, gained another 3% as investors cheered what seemingly looks like a great deal. Also working against the market in a big way was Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD). Shares of the pharma outfit were off to the tune of 1.1%, despite a respectable Q2 report that included impressive progress for sales of its HIV portfolio.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Invest in for August As for names worth a look at trading prospects here at the midpoint of the week, however, the stock charts of National-Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV), Southern Co (NYSE:SO) and CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) top a short list. Here's why, and what to look for.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips CF Industries Holdings (CF)For the first four months of the year, shares of CF Industries Holdings were stuck in a range, unable to hurdle the 200-day moving average line plotted in white on both stock charts.The stock finally cleared that hurdle in June, but things have remained choppy all the same. It increasingly looks like the breakout move is the real deal, however, as CF shares continue to find support at other key lines in the sand. And, there's little doubt about the underpinnings for the move, which only renews a long-standing uptrend.  *   Click to EnlargeTuesday's action was not only productive, it was spurred by a push up and off of the 20-day moving average line plotted in blue.  * Although it's likely to cool off again, even if just a little, the purple 50-day moving average line's cross above the 200-day line. The 'golden cross' signals that new bullish momentum is fully developed.  * On the weekly chart it becomes clear that the last two key bottoms made in March and May better define a long-term support line that extends back to the middle of 2016. Southern Co (SO)A little over a week ago, Southern Co was highlighted as a name that was dancing more often with a crucial support level. Although it was still above it at the time, the rally since the beginning of the year left the utility name vulnerable to a big pullback.There's still a glimmer of hope in that regard. But, only a glimmers. Tuesday's action took a pretty good-sized chunk out of that technical support, and did so in a way that waves a major red flag.  * 7 Hot Stocks That Killed It This Earnings Season   *   Click to Enlarge Although it didn't close below it, SO stock temporarily traded below the 50-day line on Tuesday, and it did close under the straight-line support that extend back to the beginning of the year.  * Underscoring the blow sellers dealt to Southern Co shares is the volume surge behind the tumble. There may be a lot of would-be sellers waiting in the wings.  * If this pressure turns into something more, a pullback to the $51.50 area isn't out of the question. That's where a Fibonacci retracement line awaits, and where the white 200-day moving average line will soon be. National-Oilwell Varco (NOV)Finally, it was an earnings report that spurred the volatility. As such, traders should proceed with caution. It may not last.Nevertheless, sometimes it's news that's required to jump-start a potential and even likely move. Now that the trigger has been released, National-Oilwell Varco shares could spend the next several days, or even weeks, following through on yesterday's dynamic bar.  *   Click to EnlargeThe bears initially responded to the earnings report, dragging NOV into the red. With some time to think about it, however, they changed their mind. The intraday reversal speaks volumes about the underlying sentiment.  * Underscoring the likelihood that Tuesday is a pivot point is the volume spike behind it. A flood of sellers were finally flushed out, and a flood of new buyers poured in. It's the opposite of what was witnessed in February.  * Although the stage is set for more upside, particularly given how oversold the stock has been since June, this is a setup that requires at least a little bit of follow-through to validate the swing.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-22	2019-07-22 12:57:41	SO	The Southern Company	3 Big Stock Charts for Monday: Southern Co., Fastenal and PepsiCo	The market started to follow through on Thursday's rebound effort, opening higher on Friday. When push came to shove as the closing bell for the week approached, however, traders panicked again. The S&P 500's loss of 0.62% left it at 2976.61 … the lowest close in nearly two weeks.Source: Shutterstock Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) did the most net damage, losing 1.5% of its value, with investors taking Mizuho's profit-taking advice to heart. Snapchat parent Snap (NYSE:SNAP) logged the most noteworthy loss on Friday though, falling 3.6% as investors hesitate heading into its earnings report this week. The 170% rally since its late-2018 low suggests confidence, but leaves the stock subject to profit-taking no matter what its quarterly report looks like.At the other end of the spectrum, Boeing (NYSE:BA) flew 4.5% higher after the company announced plans to take a $4.9 billion charge related to its 737 debacle. Although bad news on the surface, the market may have been pricing in worse.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 High-Flying, Overvalued Stocks in Danger of Crashing As the new week's trading action gets started though, none of those names are top trading prospects. Rather, it's the stock charts of Southern Co. (NYSE:SO), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) that merit the closest looks. PepsiCo (PEP)A week and a half ago PepsiCo was put under the microscope, as it was putting pressure on what was quickly taking shape as an important support level. That floor ended up stopping the weakness before it got started. That recovery effort, however, faltered just as quickly when a familiar ceiling was revisited. Friday's tumble was the one that broke PEP stock out of that rut, for the worst. In fact, two key technical floors were shattered, opening the door to what could be a sizable selloff.The floor in question is, or was, $130.59, marked in yellow. PepsiCo was held up there a couple of times since late June. Friday's close failed to find support there.  *   Click to EnlargeAt the same time, the setback on Friday dragged PEP shares below the 50-day moving average line, plotted in purple.  * Zooming out to the weekly timeframe puts the rally and subsequent rollover in perspective. The June stall took shape at a technical ceiling that has been in place since late 2015.  * The weekly chart also indicates the stock's coming out of an overbought condition, none of which haven't resulted in some sort of pullback.  Fastenal (FAST)With nothing more than a passing glance, it would be easy to chalk up the recent weakness from Fastenal to market-driven bearishness. And, perhaps that's all it is. Fastenal is inching dangerously close to a more significant breakdown though, and one more misstep could open the selling floodgates.  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio   *   Click to EnlargeThe good news is, the make-or-break levels are crystal clear, as is the most likely floor should the budding selloff manage to take root.  * The support area to watch is right around $30. That's just below the white 200-day moving average is, and where May's low was. That area has also been resistance in recent months, making it more meaningful.  * That said, FAST stock is putting pressure on that floor under pretty bearish circumstances. Last month, it met rather decided technical resistance at its purple 50-day moving average line (highlighted).  * The current weakness appears to be an effort to drag Fastenal all the way back to a floor currently near $26, which tags all the major lows going back to the beginning of 2016. Southern Co. (SO)Southern Co. didn't end last week on a particularly high note. The stock fell 1.5% on Friday, peeling back on above average volume. Nevertheless, the bigger trend remains a bullish one. The support line that has been steering SO shares upward since February remains intact, and Southern Co. stock remains above its pivotal moving average, plotted in pink on the daily chart.The flavor and support for the rally is changing though, for the worst. It took a bump into a familiar resistance line to get the ball rolling, but SO is now in more trouble than it may seem to be on the surface.  Click to Enlarge  * The problematic ceiling is plotted in white on the weekly chart, though it has been made more problematic by the fact that it was bumped when the RSI indicator also reached an overbought condition.  * Friday's bearish volume was above average, but not just more than the norm. It was the most daily distribution we've seen since April, hinting there are many would-be profit takers waiting in the wings.  * While the deck may be stacked against Southern Co. shares here, the pivotal line is the purple 50-day moving average line currently at $54.95.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in Boeing.

The Dow Jones Utility Average  inched less than 0.1% lower, although 8 of 15 components traded up, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  jumped 222 points, or 0.8%. AES shares jumped 1.8% after Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith raised his rating to neutral from underperform, and raised his price target to $16.50 from $16. &quot;We perceive upside to renewable development opportunities and expect [liquid natural gas]/logistics opportunities in Vietnam and the Atlantic Basin to drive future growth,&quot; Dumoulin-Smith wrote in a note to clients. Among other more-active utility stocks, Southern Co.  edged up 0.1%, Exelon Corp.  was little changed and Dominion Energy Inc.  gained 0.1%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 3.1 basis points to 1.998%, the first move below the 2% mark since November 2016, amid increasing speculation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Utilities stocks usually rise when Treasury yields fall, and Treasury prices gain, as the sector's relative high yield makes then more attractive. The Dow utilities implied dividend yield is 2.94%, compared with the implied yield for the Dow Jones Industrial Average  of 2.03%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/405a73f9-3f11-3594-8a04-0faf561e101e/utilities-stocks-inch-lower.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-15	2019-05-15 18:24:56	SO	The Southern Company	4 Dividend-Focused Utilities Pushing Higher	U.S. equities are rebounding on Wednesday thanks to another positive headline out of the President Donald Trump Administration. Specifically, it sounds like a decision on possible tariffs on auto imports from Europe will be delayed. Ostensibly, this is to clear the way to concentrate on the standoff with China and give the markets enough good news to keep prices stable.So far, it appears to be working. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is rebounding back above its 200-day moving average, the third day of testing this critical support level, and looks set for a challenge of overhead resistance near the 26,000 level. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite looks even better, attempting to climb back above the 50-day moving average thanks to big gains in the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market But its the income-oriented stocks that are catching my eye as investors pile into defensive names on the expectation that we've yet to see the last of this latest bout of volatility. Here are four names to watch:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Utility Stocks to Buy: American Electric Power (AEP)Shares of American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) are pushing up and out of a three-month consolidation range as it continues a steady long-term uptrend that goes back to the 2009 bear market low.

The company is scheduled to next report results on July 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1 per share on revenues of $4.1 billion. When the company last reported on April 25, earnings of $1.19 per share beat estimates by eight cents on a 2.5% rise in revenues. Aqua America (WTR)Shares of water utility Aqua America (NYSE:WTR) have also been flirting with new highs in recent days, jumping up and over resistance that's been in play since late 2017. The company, based in Pennsylvania, pays a 2.2% dividend yield. Analysts at Coker Palmer recently defended the name after soft quarterly results, noting it was more about timing discrepancies than softness in the underlying business.  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk The company is scheduled to next report results on Aug. 1 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 39 cents per share on revenues of $226.9 million. When the company last reported on May 2, earnings of 28 cents per share missed estimates by two cents on a 3.5% rise in revenues. Consolidated Edison (ED)Like the other names presented here, Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) shares are using the current market volatility to push to new record highs, jumping over resistance from prior highs set in late 2017 as it exits a three-month consolidation range. The stock pays a 3.5% dividend yield. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently upgraded shares to &quot;buy,&quot; and set a $94-a-share price target.The company will next report results on Aug. 1 after the close.

Southern Company (SO)Shares of power utility Southern Company (NYSE:SO) are also pushing to new highs this week, breaking up and out of a three-month consolidation range. This caps a near-30% rise off of its late December low, breaking free of a sideways channel that went back to 2016. Evercore ISI analysts recently upgraded the stock, which carries a dividend yield of 4.6%.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Trade War Reignites The company will next report results on Aug. 7 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 71 cents per share on revenues of $5.1 billion.

2019-05-02	2019-05-02 15:33:18	SO	The Southern Company	Southern Stock Is a Bit Too Risky for a Utility Play	By any conventional measure Southern (NYSE:SO) is a hot utility stock. SO stock is up 20% since the start of the year, against a 16.5% gain for the average stock in the S&P 500. Yet the 60 cent per share dividend, which is covered by earnings, still yields a fat 4.7%.Source: Shutterstock While Pacific Gas & Electric (NYSE:PCG), which tied its future to renewable energy, has gone into bankruptcy, Southern continues to stand tall.What could possibly go wrong? To put it simply, the rise of wind and solar power.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Southern's Nuclear StrategySouthern is one of the largest operators of nuclear power plants in the country, with six in all.  It's building two more, an expansion of its Plant Vogtle on the Savannah River.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May Assuming the plants come on stream by 2022, Southern will have an additional 2.4 Million megawatt hours of capacity to sell, over 10% of the region's demand.Of course, that's a big if. A similar nuclear expansion across the river, in South Carolina, cost $9 billion, resulted in 9 rate hikes, and was eventually abandoned. The utility company behind it was sold to Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) for $13.4 billion in cash and assumed debt.For now Vogtle is the only nuclear power going up that qualifies under the Republican plans for &quot;green energy,&quot; and the project is being showered with largesse in the form of federal loan guarantees that now total $12 billion.  The expansion, originally slated to cost $14 billion, now has a budget of $28 billion. Changing WindsAs costs for solar and wind energy continue to fall -- they're now cheaper than maintaining coal-fired power plants -- the long-term fate of nuclear energy is increasingly precarious.Southern directors see which way the wind is blowing. They recently tied CEO Tom Fanning's pay to cuts in SO stock's carbon footprint.  But those plans are highly dependent on finishing Vogtle and getting that energy into the grid. The riskiest operating periods for a nuclear plant are when it's new, as the Vogtle plants will be, or when it's past its useful life.These are the long-term risks SO stock, and the southeastern U.S. economy, are running as construction on the plants continues. SO Stock EarningsSouthern reported earnings May 1. Earnings per share were in line with estimates at 70 cents. Meanwhile, revenue came in a bit low at $5.4 billion instead of the expected $5.8 billion. This isn't great, as revenues generally peak in the first quarter, which covers the winter, and the third quarter, which covers the summer.SO stock fell about 1.7% on the news.Analysts don't seem to know what to think of the risk-reward balance for so, with 13 of 21 just saying hold, against 2 buyers and 5 sellers. We'll see how that changes in light of Q1 earnings, however.The dividend is one of the highest in the utility sector, but most stock buyers today want risk and utilities, by their nature, are not risky investments.The red light flashing on Southern remains the debt, used to finance the nuclear power plants. It totaled $40.5 billion at the end of 2018. That debt load must be matched against the company's equity value, $54.3 billion. Its bonds currently yield about 4.6%, close to the stock's yield. The Bottom LineA recent analyst report on Southern said it offered &quot;short-term gain and long-term pain.&quot; That's about right.Southern stock has been the best-performing among the big southeastern utilities this year, outpacing NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), Dominion and Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). But the debt load is huge, and Southern has already sold $12 billion in assets to keep the bonds afloat, including its solar energy portfolio and Gulf Power, which serves Florida.For Southern stock and debt to pay off, the nuclear plants not only have to go online, but operate profitably, over decades, in an environment where solar and wind costs are continuing to decline.  * 5 Stocks to Sell in May Before Investors Go Away That's not a good bet for a risk-off investment.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-04-01	2019-04-01 13:36:45	SO	The Southern Company	Is Johnson & Johnson the Best Stock to Hold Forever?	InvestorPlace feature writer James Brumley recently named the 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever. Included in the group was Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). While owners of JNJ stock have been handsomely rewarded over the past decade, I wonder where it ranks among the other nine companies on Brumley's list.Source: Shutterstock I have nothing against Johnson & Johnson. I use a number of its products, including Band-Aid, Aveeno, Listerine, Reactine and Tylenol. Part of Brumley's argument for owning JNJ stock for the long haul is that the company is so much more than these products.  In fiscal 2018, JNJ's consumer division, which includes all of the brands listed above, had $13.9 billion in revenue and $2.3 billion in pre-tax income. That seems like a lot, but it accounted for just 16.7% of the company's overall revenue and 12% of its pre-tax income. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile we recognize so many of its consumer brands, that's not where the growth is; it's in pharmaceuticals. But that's a subject for another day.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business In February, I wrote an article discussing how JNJ stock owners have paid a big price in the seven years that Alex Gorsky has been CEO. Sure, Gorsky's delivered above-average shareholder returns during his tenure as CEO, but given the strength of the markets over this period, it's safe to assume that other's in the healthcare industry could have done just as well at a much lower rate of compensation. Perhaps shareholders have become lackadaisical because it's hard to fathom someone making more than $400 million (that's only on JNJ stock) over seven years without expecting the world from him or her.  A Little ContestThere are many ways to determine if a stock is worth holding forever. For this article, I'm not going to use any of these metrics. Instead, I'm going to look at the total compensation of the ten CEO's on Brumley's list over the past three years. Along with that, I'll compare the three-year annualized total return of all ten stocks. I expect it will tell me all I need to know about JNJ stock and the other nine companies. CompanyTotal CEO CompensationPast 3 YearsAnnualized Total ReturnPast 3 YearsJohnson & Johnson $76.8M 11.3% AT&T (NYSE:T) $86.2M -1.9% Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) $3 15.9% 3M (NYSE:MMM) $24.7M 10.4% Walmart (NYSE:WMT) $65.0M 14.9% Southern Co. (NYSE:SO) $34.4M 4.9% Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) $1.4M 12.4% Waste Management (NYSE:WM) $23.3M* 22.3% American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) $13.5M* 17.6% Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) $41.6M 1.1% The ResultsThe average annualized total return of these ten companies over the past three years is 10.9%. Six are over that return, and four are under it. Johnson & Johnson was mediocre, just three basis points higher than the average, yet its CEO was the second-highest paid of the bunch behind Randall Stephenson of AT&T, another overpaid chief executive. Is it interesting that the two lowest-paid CEOs -- excluding Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Larry Page of Alphabet who are founders -- had the two highest-performing stocks of the bunch?I don't think so. Neither James C. Fish, CEO of Waste Management, or Susan Story of American Water Works, is going to be living on the streets anytime soon. Yet, if you own either of these stocks, you should be pleased with the balance between CEO compensation and shareholder returns. The Bottom Line on JNJ StockNothing anyone says will convince me that JNJ shareholders aren't getting a bad deal from their CEO. So, the next time you consider buying a stock, why not check on the CEO's three-year compensation relative to its three-year annualized total return. If it's not to your liking, take a pass and look elsewhere. JNJ stock might be one to hold forever, but it's not because Alex Gorsky is CEO. It's because of the all the hardworking people behind the scenes who never make it anywhere near the C-suite. As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Of the eight AP1000 reactors started over a decade ago, only the four in China operate commercially today, each completed at least five years behind schedule.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/49f7b9c9-fc26-3464-b9b7-abe78f75a1a1/plant-vogtle%3A-bad-bets%2C-red.html?.tsrc=rss

Late last year, Wall Street had a bit of a panic attack when Fed chairman Jerome Powell suggested this tightening was on autopilot.

  * 10 Triple-A Stocks to Buy in February 



While the broad market is responding with a full-throated rally, I want to focus attention on the moves in dividend stocks, many of which were battered by fears long-term interest rates were headed much higher. Here are five dividend stocks perking up:

### Southern Company (SO)

  
Click to Enlarge

Shares of Southern Company (NYSE:SO), a large utility, are threatening to push up and over a long consolidation range bounced by the $48-to-$50 threshold to the upside. One has to go all the way back to late 2015 and early 2016 for the last time shares were able to push into clear air and hit new highs. The company pays a 5% dividend yield.

Management will next report results on Feb. 20 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 24 cents per share on revenues of $5.4 billion. When the company last reported on Nov. 7, earnings of $1.14 beat estimates by 7 cents per share on an 8% rise in revenues.

### Williams Companies (WMB)

  
Click to EnlargeEnergy pipeline play Willians Companies (NYSE:WMB) is enjoying a push above its 200-day moving average, its first upside breakout since July that sets the stage for a run at the August highs, which would be worth a gain of more than 16% from here. Although oil prices have been unstable, there is a well-documented shortage of pipeline infrastructure in America's shale heartland. Notably, WMB also pays a 5.1% dividend yield.

  * 10 of the Best Stocks to Invest In for February 



The company will next report results on Feb. 13 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 22 cents per share on revenues of $2.5 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 31, earnings of 24 cents per share beat estimates by 4 cents.

### Ventas (VTR)

  
Click to EnlargeShares of Ventas (NYSE:VTR), a medical real estate investment trust (REIT), have once again rebounded off of support at its 200-day moving average, setting up a run above the early December high near $64. This could eventually be a test of the 2016-2017 highs near $67. Such a move would be worth a gain of more than 8% from here. Also note that VTR pays a 5.1% dividend yield.

The company will next report results on Feb. 8 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 95 cents per share on revenues of $915.4 million. When the company last reported on Oct. 26, earnings of 99 cents per share beat estimates by 2 cents on a 4.1% rise in revenues.

### Seagate (STX)

  
Click to EnlargeShares of computer hard drive maker Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) are blasting higher on Friday, up nearly 6%, breaking out of a downtrend pattern that has been in place since last summer. The catalyst was solid guidance from competitor Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) that wasn't as bad as the Street feared. STX shares also pay a 6.2% dividend yield.

  * 7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019 



The company will next report results on Feb. 4 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.27 per share on revenues of $2.7 billion. When the company last reported on Nov. 2, earnings of $1.70 per share beat estimates by 16 cents on a 13.7% rise in revenues.

### Western Digital (WDC)

  
Click to EnlargeWell, we might as well talk about Western Digital as well. Shares are up more than 6% after reporting results -- representing more than a full year's worth of its 5% dividend yield. The company reported earnings of $1.45 per share, down 63% from the prior year and at the low end of prior guidance on a 20.7% drop in revenues.

But management was upfront and honest about tepid demand and outlined steps it is taking in response, including lowering production levels and strengthening its product portfolio. In the wake of results, Maxim analysts reiterated their buy rating and $126 price target on evidence of a continued cost leadership position.

As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-01-25	2019-01-25 15:14:29	SO	The Southern Company	Exoneration Does Not Change The Investment Thesis on PCG Stock	"PG&E (NYSE:PCG) exploded late in Thursday trading. Traders found relief as the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection absolved the utility of any fault related to the Tubbs Fire. PCG stock surged by almost 75% to $13.95 per share following the release of this news late in the Thursday trading session. So far in Friday's trading, the rally has settled a bit, and PCG stock price hovers around 12.40.

However, they still face tens of billions in liability related to 17 other fires, which killed at least 13 people. They also face some likelihood that investigators will find them at fault in the Camp Fire -- the deadliest fire in California history. Hence, a huge chance of bankruptcy remains. For this reason, investors should probably avoid PCG stock despite the move higher.

### PCG Stock Spiked on Tubbs Fire News

According to state fire officials, a private electrical system caused the Tubbs Fire. They said PG&E beared no responsibility for the fire, which burned almost 37,000 acres in Napa and Sonoma counties and killed 22 people.

  * 7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now 



The news heartened owners of PCG stock as the price of the equity spiked higher. However, the firm still bears responsibility for 18 wildfires that occurred in 2017. Fire officials have also not exonerated the company in the Camp Fire. That blaze killed 86 people, and PG&E admitted that a high-voltage line failed in this area before the fire started.

### PG&E Not Out of the Woods

Investors should also note that even without liability from the Tubbs Fire, the costs related to other fires could still push the company into bankruptcy. Analysts had estimated the total damages at about $30 billion. Although that figure includes the Tubbs Fire, the company still faces billions in fire-related liability. Moody's cut PG&E credit rating to junk status. They said that the decision regarding the Tubbs Fire would not change that rating.

Not all agree that this will lead to bankruptcy for PCG stock. To be sure, the PCG stock price of almost $13 per share implies less of a danger of bankruptcy. Moreover, a bailout from the State of California remains possible. However, Governor Gavin Newsom has shown no interest in such a move.

Hence, investors should approach this stock on the likely assumption of a Chapter 11 filing. At this stage, buying PCG stock amounts to a gamble that the company will avoid liability in the Camp Fire. Given the utility's admittance of a power line failure in the area, that seems like a bet investors are unlikely to win.

### PG&E Not the Usual Utility Stock

Also, as I mentioned in a recent article, utility stock investors do not sign up for this kind of turmoil. Usually, investors buy utility stocks for stability and dividend income. They want firms such as Dominion Resources (NYSE:D), Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK), or Southern Company (NYSE:SO) that quietly generate power, deliver service, and distribute profits among shareholders.

Prospective buyers should also remember the fact that this company holds a monopoly in providing the energy needed to sustain life. Even with that guaranteed book of business, they still face Chapter 11. One can debate whether the PG&E management team or poor forestry management in the state led to this point. However, no matter where the fault lies, the investment decision remains the same.

Even if the company avoided bankruptcy, liability costs would preclude a return of the dividend for years to come. Hence, all signs point to PCG stock as a high-risk gamble at best.

### The Bottom Line on PCG Stock

Despite the surge in PCG stock, risks remain incredibly high, and even risk-tolerant investors would likely see better results looking elsewhere. Although PG&E will not bear any liability from the Tubbs Fire, the utility still faces tens of billions in liability stemming from other blazes. Given that cost and the decreasing likelihood that the firm will receive a bailout, speculative investors should look to other equities.

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is negative 
  * ETFs holding this stock are seeing positive inflows but are weakening 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output in this company's sector is contracting



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is low for SO with fewer than 5% of shares on loan. The last change in the short interest score occurred more than 1 month ago and implies that there has been little change in sentiment among investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Negative

## Will the defensives repeat 2018?

Utilities continued to underperform broader markets last week. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) rose almost 1%, while the S&P 500 rose 2.5% in the week ending January 11. Utilities beat the S&P 500 by a wide margin in 2018 particularly when markets started falling in the fourth quarter.

The benchmark ten-year Treasury yield was largely flat last week—it closed at 2.70%. Utility stocks and Treasury yields usually trade inversely to each other. Higher interest rates could make utilities less appealing compared to bonds. The Fed delivered four quarter-point rate hikes last year—the most hikes since it started rate normalization in 2015.

## Movers and shakers

NextEra Energy (NEE), the biggest utility by market cap, stock rose ~2%, while Duke Energy (DUK) fell almost 1% last week. Regulated utility giant Southern Company (SO) grew more than 4%, while Dominion Energy (D) fell more than 3%.

PG&E (PCG) stock fell 30% last week due to bankruptcy concerns. On January 13, PG&E reported that CEO Geisha Williams resigned. We’ll discuss PG&E more in the next part of this series.

Merchant power stock NRG Energy (NRG) rose more than 3% last week. NRG Energy was the top-rallied stock in 2018 among utilities. The stock rose almost 37% in 2018. Read Will NRG Energy Stock Continue to Increase in 2019? to learn more.

Competitive utility Exelon (EXC) rose 2.6%, while FirstEnergy (FE) rose 3.2% last week. So far in 2019, utilities at large have risen ~0.6%, while S&P 500 has risen almost 4%.

2019-01-08	2019-01-08 20:18:06	SO	The Southern Company	10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market)	"As is usually the case, Santa Claus brought a rally to Wall Street this year. Since the Christmas break, the S&P 500 has gained more than 8%, and it looks ready to test the waters of higher highs.

Still, considering the complete meltdown that played out in the days leading up to the pivot, investors remain reticent. The same index fell 20% between its September peak and its December lows, and it's possible the rebound since then is nothing more than a dead-cat bounce that's on the verge of screeching halt. The political backdrop is certainly troubling enough to inspire doubts about the market's foreseeable future.

It's environments like this that prompt people to look for less stressful solutions … names one can step into and still sleep well at night with, knowing that in time they'll at least keep pace with the market's overall progress. And, with above-average consistency working in their favor, they may well outperform the broad market.

  * The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index 



To that end, here's a run-down of ten of the best stocks to invest in if you're looking for some simple &quot;set it and forget it&quot; stocks … even in this crazy environment. In no particular order…

Source: Shutterstock 

### Walmart (WMT)

It's not a name that needs much in the way of an introduction. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is the world's biggest retailer, operating more than 11,000 stores here and abroad.

It's also the go-to source for a variety of consumer needs, ranging from groceries to school supplies to electronics to medicine. There's never a time when Walmart doesn't have something to sell. It may not be entirely recession-proof, but it's certainly recession-resistant.

Yes, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) lapped Walmart on the e-commerce front at a time when Walmart got lazy and sloppy within the brick-and-mortar arena. The company isn't infallible. The world's biggest retailer has certainly stepped up its game though, and WMT has become competitive again … online and offline.

### Southern Co (SO)

Most thorough lists of the best stocks to buy for investors that don't want to babysit their portfolios will include at least one utility name. That entry this time around is Southern Co (NYSE:SO), which delivers electricity and/or natural gas to a total of nine million customers in the United States.

The logic is obvious enough. Although consumers may postpone the purchase of a new car or decide to skip an extravagant vacation in any given year, there's never a time when consumers don't pay their utility bills. They need electricity 24/7. It may not be a growth-industry, but it's an incredibly reliable one.

  * 10 Top Stock Picks From the Street's Best Analysts 



The kicker: Utility stocks aren't bad income drivers either. Southern's current yield is an above-average 5.5%, and its per-share payout hasn't failed to grow in any year for almost the past 20.

### Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)

It's not a mistake. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has earned a spot on a list of the market's &quot;set it and forget it stocks.&quot;

Contrary to its common mental categorization, it's not as much of a technology name as it is a consumer services name. And, while the nature of the search/ad business is forever changing (per-click prices have been drifting lower for years, for one), Alphabet's Google is well-positioned to remain the intermediary that connects consumers with internet content.

The advent of mobile internet hasn't changed that reality either. A whopping 88% of smartphones in use today are powered by Android, which was built and is still maintained by Alphabet's Google.

The market may not like the pace of its revenue and profit growth from time to time, but nobody can deny it's become a growth machine.

### Visa (V)

Some investors look at the future of the payments industry and believe it belongs to names like Square (NYSE:SQ) or Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL). And, those names are certainly worthy players, while old-school outfits like Visa (NYSE:V) look and feel like relics simply due to their age.

Don't let the proverbial gray hairs and wrinkles fool you, though. Payment middleman Visa is not only still a player, it's more cutting-edge than most investors may fully appreciate.

Case in point: The company maintains several so-called &quot;Innovation Centers&quot; that solely focus on figuring out where the worlds of technology and money are going to meet in the future.

Visa was one of the first mainstream names to tinker with bitcoin-based payments, and its Visa Checkout platform has made online shopping a one-step snap (not to mention fast). Visa's going to be fine for a long, long time.

### Waste Management (WM)

They say the only two things that are certain in this world are death and taxes, but the axiom skips an important absolute -- That is, as long as mankind populates the planet, there will be trash to dispose of, one way or another. Enter Waste Management (NYSE:WM), which hauls away garbage for 21 million U.S. and Canadian customers.

It's admittedly not the sexiest of business lines, But, it's reliable, and drives more growth than most investors might suspect. Better still, the company is increasingly turning your trash into their treasure. At 130 of its landfills, Waste Management converts naturally occurring decomposition gas into enough energy to power more than 440,000 homes.

Neither business line is ever going to become obsolete.

### American Tower (AMT)

If you think wireless carriers own the cell phone towers you see peppered across the country's landscape, think again. They generally lease access to those towers, and pay the tower's owner/operator to keep power flowing to all the equipment attached to those towers.

American Tower (NYSE:AMT) is one of only a handful of such service providers, boasting a network of more than 170,000 towers in 17 different countries and five different continents. As long as the world uses cell phones (and increasingly, wireless broadband), American Tower will be in business.

That, however, isn't the only reason AMT is one of the best stocks to own at any time, regardless of the environment. Bolstering the bullish case here is that the company is organized as a REIT, which is a tax-advantaged vehicle for sharing its rental income with shareholders.

### Brown-Forman (BF.A, BF.B)

It comes as no real surprise to learn that consumers who drink wine and other spirits do so on a pretty regular basis.

That's not to suggest Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF.A, NYSE:BF.B) has mustered hyper-reliable revenue growth, because it hasn't. Ditto for earnings growth. Progress on both fronts is generally a good bet, but not necessarily bulletproof.

Nevertheless, it's not a lack of demand that causes the company's ebbs and flows. Mostly competition and expenses that sway its results from one quarter to the next … factors that generally end up being only short-term headwinds for the Brown-Forman.

Of course, with brand names like Jack Daniel's, Korbel and Finlandia being part of the family, it's never too tough for Brown-Forman to regroup.

Source: Shutterstock 

### Verizon Communications (VZ)

For the two companies to be seemingly so similar to one another, it's amazing that AT&T (NYSE:T) and primary rival Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) are able to dish out such different results for shareholders. But, numbers don't lie. For the past twelve months, VZ stock is up nearly 10%, while T shares are down almost 19%.

The mismatched results may largely reflect a less aggressive approach being taken by Verizon to stake a claim in the ever-changing world of video entertainment.

  * 7 Best Fidelity Funds for 2019 



Whereas AT&T swung for the fences with its acquisition of Time Warner -- and arguably overextended itself -- Verizon's not been as quick to wade into waters that were less than clear. That's made a big difference with investors, even if it's only a perceived difference.

Source: Shutterstock 

### Bank of America (BAC)

Don't misread the message. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is anything but resistant to economic cycles. Indeed, it's uncomfortably sensitive to changes in interest rates… just one of many stumbling blocks it must navigate from time to time. But, if you can deal with the occasional setback and are willing to ride out the rough patches, B of A may be one of the best stocks to own for the long haul.

That wasn't necessarily always the case. More so than others, Bank of America struggled to work its way out of the subprime mortgage funk, struggling with the earliest of its so-called stress tests.

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger though, and at the same time Bank of America finally started clicking with the Federal Reserve, CEO Brian Moynihan was able to cut costs to the bone. What's left is a lean, mean banking machine that could merely coast for years to come and still be a top name to own.

### Church & Dwight (CHD)

Finally, although Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is usually the suggested 'forever' pick from the consumer staples sector, investors may want to instead consider smaller rival Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) as one of the best stocks to invest in from this particular sector.

You know the company better than you think you do. This is the organization that owns brand names like Arm & Hammer, Oxi-Clean, Orajel, Waterpik and more. It didn't used to have the marketing firepower P&G did, but changes in the way consumers evaluate and purchase goods now has leveled the playing field, so to speak.

The end result is an organization that only once in the past ten years has quarterly revenue fallen on a year-over-year basis. Income growth has been almost as impressive, even if not quite as consistent as top-line progress.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Total return

Utilities played out well last year amid broader markets’ volatility. The utilities, including dividends, returned more than 6%, while the S&P 500 returned -6% last year.

Utilities generally have stable earnings due to their low-risk and regulated operations. Investors usually turn to utilities during uncertainties due to their slow and stable stock price movements and high dividend payments. Currently, utilities yield 3.3%, which is notably higher than broader markets.

Utilities (XLU) (IDU) didn’t just beat broader markets last year. They have outperformed the S&P 500 in the past three and five years as well. In the last five years, utilities returned 68%, while the S&P 500 returned 52%. The total return considers the capital appreciation and dividends paid in a particular period.

Regulated utilities Southern Company (SO) and PPL (PPL) offer a dividend yield of 5.4% and 5.9%, respectively. Both of the utilities lagged their peers in terms of total returns in the last few years. To learn why these top-yielding utilities failed, read Southern Company’s Total Returns Compared to Its Peers.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Moving averages

Recently, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) seemed to be lingering around its 200-day simple moving average level. Currently, XLU is trading at $52.8, which is ~3% below its 50-day moving average levels. The level close to $54.4 is expected to act as resistance for XLU in the short term. If XLU doesn’t hold the 200-day moving average level close to $52.6, then it might have more weakness in the near future.

XLU is trading at an RSI (relative strength index) of 42, which implies that it isn’t in the oversold or the overbought zone. RSI levels at extremes suggest an imminent reversal in the stock’s direction.

## Top utilities’ chart indicators

Among the top utilities, Southern Company (SO) stock seems weak based on its moving average levels. The stock is trading at $44.7, which is almost 3% and 2% below its 50-day and 200-day moving average levels, respectively. At the same time, NRG Energy (NRG) is trading marginally above its 50-day moving average and 12% above its 200-day moving average level. The premium to both of the levels indicates strength in the stock. NRG Energy, one of the smallest constituents of the Utilities ETF (XLU), was the top-rallied utility stock in 2018. The stock rose more than 37% last year.

## Implied volatility

The volatility levels seem to be easing across broader markets—compared to the surge witnessed in the last few months. Broader utilities (VPU) and the S&P 500’s implied volatility was close to 19% on January 4—lower than their respective 15-day average. Increased volatility represents investors’ anxiety. Increased volatility is usually related to falling stock prices.

2019-01-07	2019-01-07 12:30:25	SO	The Southern Company	NEE, DUK, SO, and D: Analysts’ Views and Target Prices	"How Top Utility Stocks Are Placed at the Beginning of 2019

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Analysts’ target prices

Analysts expect an upside potential of almost 10% from NextEra Energy (NEE) stock based on the median target price of $186.1 and its current price of $169.8.

Duke Energy (DUK), the second-largest utility by market cap, has a median target price of $87.7, which reflects a potential upside of almost 4% from its current price of $84.7 over the next 12 months.

The above chart shows Wall Street analysts’ views on the top utility stocks as of January 2.

Southern Company (SO) stock offers a potential upside of more than 7% over the next 12 months. Analysts gave the company a median target price of $46.9—compared to its current price of $43.7.

Dominion Energy (D) has a median target price of $76.6—compared to its current price of $71.2, which implies a potential upside of 7.6% over the next 12 months.

Utilities’ outperformance last year was mainly driven by market uncertainties. The recent weakness in utilities could be an opportunity given the fair valuation of many big names. Considering the estimated gain based on analysts’ target prices and the current dividend yield, top utility stocks present an attractive total return for 2019.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Chart indicators

Even though utilities outperformed broader markets in 2018, the recent weakness is a concern. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU), the representative of top utilities in the country, fell almost 10% in the second half of December. Let’s see where top utility stocks might go in the short term.

NextEra Energy (NEE) is trading at $169.8—almost 4% below its 50-day simple moving average and marginally above its 200-day moving average level. The 200-day level close to $168.9 will likely be crucial support for NextEra Energy stock going forward. NextEra Energy’s RSI (relative strength index) is 33.

## Southern Company stock is oversold

Southern Company (SO) stock is trading in the “oversold” zone with its RSI below 30. RSI levels at extremes indicate an impending reversal in the stock’s direction. Southern Company is trading 5% and 4% below its 50-day and 200-day moving average levels, respectively. The fair discount to both of these levels indicates weakness in the stock.

Recently, Duke Energy (DUK) and Dominion Energy (D) shares fell below the 50-day moving average, which suggests weakness in the stock. Duke Energy and Dominion Energy have an RSI close to 34, which indicates that they aren’t in the oversold or the overbought zone. Their respective 200-day moving average level might act as a support in the short term.

The proposal “would rescind excessive burdens on America’s energy providers and level the playing field so that new energy technologies can be part of America’s future,” acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler told energy lobbyists, free-market advocates, and others gathered at the EPA for the announcement.  The carbon-capture requirement EPA is proposing to eliminate is one obstacle to building coal power plants, though economic and market realities have created much higher hurdles that analysts say will endure no matter what the Trump administration does.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-aims-lift-hurdle-coal-090000937.html?.tsrc=rss

The rating downgrade reflects the increased uncertainty for the security for the Project J bonds owing to the legal action taken by JEA (FL) Electric Enterprise (JEA:A2 negative) and the City of Jacksonville (A2 negative), as plaintiffs, to attempt to repudiate the Project J take-or-pay power purchase agreement (PPA) obligation, notwithstanding the strong legal protections which underlie the ""hell or ""high"" water nature of the obligation.  The rating action also acknowledges the weakened credit profile at JEA, the off-taker for Project J, following their recent downgrade to A2 owing in large part to our concerns about their willingness to honor the take-or-pay obligations which support the Project J debt along with the expected decline in the future financial performance caused in part by JEA's exposure to the Vogtle 3&4 nuclear project."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/affc6bc4-504d-318f-8d69-7863796fc4b8/municipal-electric-authority.html?.tsrc=rss

By the start of June utility companies had issued almost $10  billion of common stock, by far the largest amount for this  point in the year since the financial crisis, Thomson Reuters  data showed.  The need to issue equity highlights how tax reform, viewed  by many as a giveaway to corporate America, has come at a price  for certain utility companies, diluting the holdings of some  shareholders and delivering a hit to credit positions.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-tax-reform-reenergizes-equity-153807354.html?.tsrc=rss

Planting the right tree in the right place may help decrease the likelihood of a power outage in the event of a storm while ensuring that power lines are clear of trees and brush provides also easier access to the company's power lines, which means quicker power restoration after a storm.  Georgia Power recommends dividing your yard into three specific planting zones – the Tall Zone (trees 60 feet or higher), the Medium Zone (trees no taller than 40 feet), and the Low Zone (trees and shrubs no taller than 25 feet).	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plant-tree-place-spring-201400302.html?.tsrc=rss
