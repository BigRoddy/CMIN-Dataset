Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock has lagged the broader market by a huge margin over the past decade, and its woes have been accelerated by the loss of its manufacturing and technology lead to rival foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) in 2018.  TSMC leapfrogged Intel when it started the mass production of chips based on the 7 nanometer (nm) manufacturing process.  Chipzilla, meanwhile, failed to make the jump to the competing 10 nm process, triggering a downfall in its fortunes on the stock market as rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) started eating its cake.  The bad news is that AMD seems in no mood to take its foot off the gas -- but that doesn't necessarily mean that Intel can't fight back.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e260cc67-f13e-34e8-babb-ed6364576b3e/where-will-intel-stock-be-in.html?.tsrc=rss

As a result, TSMC will set up a research and development facility in Japan in partnership with the government. It will use that facility to collaborate with more than 20 Japanese companies on semiconductor technology advancements. The participating companies will include Ibiden, Asahi Kasei, Shin-Etsu Chemical, Shibaura Mechatronics, and Nagase. TSMC will invest about $337 million in the project, which is about half of the project’s cost. The Japanese government will also fund the project. The research facility will be set up at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Ibaraki Prefecture. The project will begin with a trial before entering full operation in 2022. In addition to helping advance Japan’s chip technology, the Japanese government is also expecting TSMC to set up a manufacturing plant in the country. TSMC is the world’s largest contract chipmaker with customers including Apple (AAPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM). (See TSMC stock analysis on TipRanks) On April 15, Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini reiterated a Sell rating on TSM but raised the price target from $83 to $85, implying 27.57% downside potential. The analyst observed that TSMC’s $100 billion capex plan would drive revenue growth for the next three years, but depreciation and higher operating expenses will weigh on earnings. “Strengthening demand environment, in our opinion, is enabling TSM to increase wafer prices across most nodes, though the sustainability of wafer price increase into 2022 and beyond is not clear,” noted Hosseini. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Hold based on 1 Buy, 2 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $83 implies a 29.28% downside potential from the current price. TSM scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting the stock is likely to outperform the market.

2021-05-26	2021-05-26 22:57:06	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Nvidia Gives Strong Forecast on Gamer, Data Center Demand	(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp., the largest U.S. chipmaker by market value, gave a bullish forecast on demand for chips used in gaming PCs, data centers and cryptocurrency mining.Revenue in the current quarter will be about $6.3 billion, plus or minus 2%, the Santa Clara, California-based company said in a statement late Wednesday. The sales prediction compares with a $5.49 billion average analyst estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang has drawn investors to his company’s stock by persuading owners of data centers that are the backbone of the internet that his graphics chips are key to artificial intelligence-based computing. The company expects that demand and orders from gamers to continue to improve into the second half of the year.A $400 million chunk of second-quarter revenue will come from special chips Nvidia has created for use by cryptocurrency miners. The company is hoping the chips for cryptocurrency will stop those miners from siphoning off the supply of gaming graphics products and prevent a flood of used parts causing a glut later. The cryptomining processors, or CMPs, can’t be used in computers for gaming or any other conventional graphics-related tasks, Huang said in an interview.“With CMP we learned to move faster,” he said. “The important thing is that data center is doing great and gaming is doing great.”Nvidia’s leader said that CMPs are made out of graphics chips that would not have been usable because of manufacturing-related flaws in some of their elements. Being able to repurpose and sell them increases Nvidia’s overall supply availability.Nvidia is one of the pioneers of outsourcing production and has never owned factories. Like its peers and rivals it depends on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. for manufacturing at a time when the whole industry is experiencing a spike in demand as parts of the world economy emerge from the depths of the pandemic. Nvidia has said shortages have constrained its growth.Fiscal first-quarter revenue rose 84% to $5.66 billion and profit excluding certain costs was $3.66 a share in the period, which ended May 2, the company said. Analysts, on average, predicted earnings of $3.31 a share on sales of $5.41 billion.Nvidia reported data center chip sales rose 79% to $2.05 billion in the fiscal first quarter from a year earlier. Revenue from gaming doubled to $2.76 billion in the quarter.The stock was down less than 1% in extended trading following the announcement. It closed at $628 in New York Wednesday, leaving it up 20% in 2021. Last week Nvidia announced that it will split its stock 4 for 1 to try to accessible to investors and employees.(Updates with CEO comments beginning in the fourth paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-gives-strong-forecast-driven-204509160.html?.tsrc=rss

The plan isn’t finalized and is subject to change, they said. The company targets a valuation of 30 billion yuan to 50 billion yuan, said one of the people.China’s semiconductor makers are seeking to capitalize on the government’s push to match the U.S. and become more self-reliant as global chip supply dwindles. The world’s most-populous nation wants to build a group of technology giants that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., with Premier Li Keqiang pledging to boost spending and drive research into cutting-edge chips.Founded in 2017, SigmaStar designs chips for security systems, sports cameras, self-driving vehicles, and smart home devices, among other products, according to the company’s website. Its backers include China’s Kunqiao Capital and SummitView Capital, according to CB Insights.SigmaStar representatives didn’t immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.Shanghai’s STAR board was rolled out in 2019 as a testing ground that allowed streamlined registration-based IPOs, eased caps on valuations and price swings in the first few days of trading.

2021-05-24	2021-05-24 08:59:42	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	World’s Supply of Chips Is in Danger Unless Taiwan Gets Vaccines	(Bloomberg) -- Back in February, as the world was beating a path to Taiwan’s door for help to tackle a shortage of semiconductors, the health minister got into a scrap with China over Covid-19 vaccines.Beijing, he suggested, had used political pressure to derail Taiwan’s plan to purchase five million doses directly from Germany’s BioNTech SE, rather than via a Chinese company which held the rights to develop and market the BioNTech-Pfizer Inc. vaccine across China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying retorted that Taipei “should stop hyping up political issues under the pretext of vaccine issues.”Three months later, Taiwan is paying the price for a lack of vaccines, with a surge in virus cases that threatens to trigger a lockdown. Having successfully sidestepped the first Covid wave, the government now faces a health emergency — only about 1% of its population is vaccinated so far — with the potential to disrupt the chip industry that dominates the local economy, and which is critical to an already-squeezed global supply.That’s a link made by the head of Taiwan’s office in New York, who warned of “logistical problems” without access to more shots. Yet by shunning vaccines from China and warning of more chip shortages if it can’t source enough doses elsewhere, the government is giving even greater incentive to the world’s biggest economies to make investments that may erode Taiwan’s competitive edge in semiconductors over the long term.Taiwan’s predicament illustrates its strategic yet vulnerable position at the confluence of U.S.-China tensions. Separated by a 110 mile (177 kilometer)-wide strait, Taiwan is regarded as a province by Beijing and its conquest is President Xi Jinping’s key goal for historical and ideological reasons. The U.S. is an ally of Taipei’s democratic government and a big buyer of its exports, dominated by chips produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.The onset late last year of chip shortages that have hobbled industries from autos to computer gaming had looked to give Taipei global leverage. TSMC is the world’s leading provider of cutting-edge semiconductors and holds 56% of the so-called foundry business of manufacturing chips designed by customers including Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc.But Taiwan has suffered a sudden reversal of fortunes. The pandemic comes just as a drought triggers power outages, stoking economic uncertainty and a slump in what was the world’s best performing stock index in the four years to January.Read More: The World Is Dangerously Dependent on Taiwan for SemiconductorsWhat’s more, the very source of Taiwan’s recent geopolitical clout — its dominance of the market for cutting-edge chips — is under attack as governments from the U.S. to Europe and Japan, alerted to the strategic nature of the semiconductor supply chain, seek to spur production at home. China is pumping billions into catching up after Washington imposed export controls on U.S. chip technology.“I think we’ve become too dependent on Taiwan and Korea, that’s the point, we need a more balanced global supply chain,” Pat Gelsinger, chief executive officer of Silicon Valley’s Intel Corp., the world’s biggest chipmaker, said in an interview. The U.S. and Europe should act “more aggressively” to counter the “imbalance” of Asia’s lead in manufacturing semiconductors that are mostly consumed in the west, he said.Intel is a rival and plans to challenge TSMC at the cutting edge, but Gelsinger isn’t the only voice making for uncomfortable listening in Taiwan. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said this month that while the Biden administration is working with Taipei and TSMC to address the chip shortage, it’s also looking to reduce U.S. dependence on Taiwan. TSMC is in the process of building a new fabrication facility in the U.S.Some in Washington have suggested that Taiwan is a backdoor to China by enabling tech transfers. Republicans Michael McCaul and Tom Cotton have called on the administration to engage with Taipei to do more to “mitigate the risk of Taiwanese companies providing services and technologies to entities of concern,” a reference to Chinese state-backed companies with links to the military.With the prospect of some $50 billion in government funding to build out chip making in the U.S. and the promise of still more in Europe and South Korea, there are signs that Taiwan is starting to feel the heat.The government is working to draft a new export control list targeting technologies with military use, to tighten curbs on exports to China and raise the penalty for violations, according to a person familiar with the issue who asked not to be named discussing policy deliberations. That’s after Alchip Technologies Ltd’s stock took a beating in April when the Washington Post reported that it supplied chips to Phytium, a People’s Liberation Army-affiliated entity. Alchip said it has always been in compliance with government regulations and that Phytium projects were on hold.Taipei has become more alert to the possibility of Chinese companies ramping up efforts to recruit Taiwanese engineers. Last month the Cabinet met to discuss how to prevent the outflow of local talent, with the Ministry of Labor instructing local job-search websites to remove ads recruiting Taiwanese citizens to work for China, particularly in the semiconductor industry.Companies and headhunters can be fined as much as NT$500,000 ($17,900) for advertising such jobs and NT$5 million for facilitating local engineers’ employment with Chinese companies on the mainland, ministry official Huang Chiao-ting said. Job search site 1111 said it has removed close to 3,000 job listings. Investigators have visited the local offices of four Chinese companies, including Bitmain Technologies Ltd, within the last two months to look into allegations they recruited engineers illegally.“By more aggressively investigating Chinese companies’ efforts to poach Taiwanese engineers, we hope we can help prevent potential trade secrets leaking to China should local talent get hired away,” said Judy Chen, a spokeswoman for the Hsinchu District Prosecutors Office. She declined to name the other companies probed.Members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party are considering amending the law to boost penalties for intellectual property theft. Lawmaker Chao Tien-lin is proposing life sentences for those found guilty of economic espionage, a crime not currently on the statute books in Taiwan.“Taiwan needs to win trust from its partners and help prevent China from building a supply chain from stolen technology,” Chao said in comments provided by his assistant.Whether it’s enough to allay concerns in Washington may become clearer with the publication of President Joe Biden’s review of the semiconductor supply chain. The 100 day review is due to conclude on June 4. What’s already known is that there is bipartisan support to build U.S. chip making, and Taiwan is in the cross hairs.“Taiwan dominates semiconductor manufacturing, and one company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, virtually controls the market,” Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who introduced the CHIPS for America Act to boost U.S. production, said on the Senate floor this month.The sustainability of Taiwan’s industry has also come into question after it suffered power outages this month, focusing attention on environmental factors including water shortages and uncertainty over future electricity supply for power-hungry chip plants.On Monday, shares in tech companies such as smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. and computer giant Lenovo Group Ltd. slid over concerns that Taiwan’s Covid outbreak could further jeopardize semiconductor supplies. Read more: The Chip Industry Has a Problem With Its Giant Carbon FootprintTaiwan can potentially overcome the virus outbreak as well as the power and water shortages, showing its companies “can still satisfy global demand by manufacturing mostly in Taiwan without any issue,” said Arisa Liu, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.In the short term that will require vaccines. On Saturday, the chairman of Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co. Ltd., the Greater China distributor of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, told China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency that the company was willing “to use the vaccine to serve Taiwan compatriots.” But it’s unclear if Taiwan would now accept a vaccine deal that goes through Fosun, making it more likely any shots will come from Europe or the U.S. According to Chunhuei Chi, a former health-policy adviser in Taiwan who is now director of the Center for Global Health at Oregon State University, “many politicians in Taiwan urged the Taiwanese government to use microchips as leverage” for vaccines.While the government is reluctant to use that leverage explicitly, he said, “if the U.S. is concerned about the supply of chips from TSMC, the U.S. would have incentives to provide Taiwan with vaccines to make sure production will not be disrupted by this outbreak.”(Updates with share moves in 23rd paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-supply-chips-danger-unless-210020715.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-20	2021-05-20 22:20:37	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Applied Materials Gives Strong Forecast on Machinery Demand	(Bloomberg) -- Applied Materials Inc. gave a bullish forecast for the current quarter boosted by orders from chipmakers rushing to add capacity to meet a flood of demand for their products.Revenue will be about $5.92 billion in the three-month period ending in July, the Santa Clara, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $5.52 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, minus certain items, will be $1.70 to $1.82 per share in the fiscal third quarter, Applied Materials said. That compares with an average estimate of $1.56.Applied Materials is the biggest maker of machinery used to produce semiconductors, the essential electronic component at the center of shortages currently hurting industries from smartphones to autos. The company, with customers including Samsung Electronics Co., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp., provides forecasts that are a key indicator of future demand for electronics.After two years of slowing investment, the chip industry has found itself unable to keep up with surging demand as the economy emerges from the depths of the pandemic lockdowns. It takes Applied Materials and its competitors months to build the complicated machines that are the most expensive part of multibillion-dollar chip factories. That inertia means that production lines being planned now won’t start operations until next year at the earliest.The company sees the total market for chip factory equipment growing to the high $70 billion range this year, Chief Financial Officer Dan Durn said on a conference call after the results were reported. That will expand again in 2022 to bring the two-year total to more than $160 billion, he projected.While Applied’s executives believe rising demand will continue over an extended period driven by the expansion of semiconductors into devices outside the historical concentration in computers and phones, some investors are betting this may be a peak for the company. The market for semiconductor equipment has been unpredictable in the past because of the difficulty chipmakers have in balancing their capacity increases, which take years to implement, with short-term fluctuations in demand.“There’s some investor concern that we’re peaking and this is still a cyclical industry,” said Patrick Ho, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. “I don’t believe that. Multiple markets now require semiconductor content.”After rising initially in extended trading following the release of its earnings, Applied stock fell less than 1%. The shares closed at $130.31 in New York, gaining 51% this year.Fiscal second-quarter net income increased to $1.33 billion, or $1.43 a share, from $755 million, or 82 cents, from a year earlier, the company said. Sales rose 41% to $5.58 billion in the period ended May 2.

2021-05-20	2021-05-20 13:58:39	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Infineon Adds to Doubts About Europe’s Chipmaking Ambitions	(Bloomberg) -- The European Union’s plan to become a powerhouse in producing next-generation semiconductors will do little to help the region’s vital industries today, one of its biggest homegrown chipmakers said Thursday.“We think Europe should focus on bringing modern, but not state-of-the art technology” to meet local demand, Helmut Gassel, Infineon Technologies AG’s chief marketing officer, said in an interview.As chip shortages ripple through industry after industry -- preventing companies from fulfilling demand for products from cars to game consoles and refrigerators -- the EU wants to double its chip production to at least 20% of global supply in the next decade.Read More: Chip Crisis in ‘Danger Zone’ as Wait Times Reach New Record The approach aims to boost the design and production of 20-nanometer to 10-nanometer chips with the help of a European alliance of chipmakers, research centers and national governments. It would then target production below 5-nanometers down to 2-nanometers, an ambitious goal not yet reached by industry leaders Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co.But the goals for the cutting-edge chips that are more expensive to make have drawn skepticism from the industry. The decline of the region’s consumer electronics industry in recent decades has left Europe without obvious customers for the smallest and most powerful components. Carmakers, whose vehicles have room to hide older, bulkier chips, are where most of the demand for semiconductors lies for now. Only fully autonomous vehicles would eventually be able to take advantage of the higher computing power found in the more advanced chips, Gassel said. The German company is one of the world’s largest suppliers of automotive chips. “The vast majority, if not all of the components, in a car today and in the next five years to come, won’t take any benefit from anything below 20-nanometers,” said Gassel. “If your product doesn’t need the functionality, then you will not use it because every time you shrink” transistors on chips, the cost goes up exponentially. STMicroelectronics NV Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery has also distanced his company from the EU’s ambition. “If it’s about advanced technologies, we don’t have any reason to participate,” Chery told French news channel BFM TV this month. “That’s marginal to our activities.”Gassel said if the alliance’s plans were more targeted to the European ecosystem, including automotive, industrial and internet-of-things production, the company would be willing to participate.Read More: EU’s Breton Says Time to Fix ‘Naive’ Approach to Chip SupplySpeed NeedThe architect of the EU chip plan, Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton, pushed back at a press conference later on Thursday, saying his job is to “prepare for the next market and it will come sooner than we think.”For now, European chip suppliers were focused on car components as that’s where the market lies, said Breton. However, he said Europe will need very high-speed processors to power 5G wireless networks and so-called edge computing, where devices process data themselves instead of transmitting it back to a data center. Pointing to foreign companies like TSMC, Samsung and Intel Corp. that are already making plans to produce semiconductors below 5 nanometers, Breton said “if others see the market, I don’t see why, in Europe, we don’t see the market.”ASML Holding NV, the Dutch producer of chip manufacturing equipment, backed him up. The prospect of new innovations means it makes “perfect sense” to build a European production base, ASML Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink said at the press conference alongside Breton.(Adds Breton, ASML CEO reaction from 10th paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infineon-adds-doubts-europe-chipmaking-135839985.html?.tsrc=rss

Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su, who took the helm in 2014, has returned the chipmaker to profitability, taken market share from Intel Corp. and banished concerns about the company running out of cash.More than six years into her tenure, AMD has seen its market value surge to more than $90 billion from about $2 billion when Su was named CEO. On Wednesday, the company unveiled a $4 billion stock-repurchase plan, its first buyback since 2001, highlighting its new financial heft and stability. Still, Su isn’t ready to take a victory lap.“Without a doubt it does not get easier,” Su said in an interview with Bloomberg Technology’s Emily Chang. “We’re in a very competitive market. We have big ambitions about what we want to be able to do.”Su’s AMD has gone from an also-ran chipmaker offering cheaper alternatives to Intel products to a respected provider of computer processors that win orders based on superior performance. Su, the first woman to become CEO of a major chip company, said her main accomplishment has been earning AMD a new reputation for delivering on its promises. She has won customers’ trust that AMD can consistently supply improving products, she said.The executive has restored AMD’s reputation and performance at a critical juncture for the industry. The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated demand for remote computing via the internet and for devices needed to support study and work at home. And all this came during a period when Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, had struggled to improve its manufacturing technology, one of the foundations of its decades-long dominance of the computer industry.Su said recent chip shortages, which have hamstrung multiple industries as the world economy comes back to life, are not a disaster -- they’re just another example of the periodic imbalances between supply and demand in the semiconductor market. One silver lining for the chip industry is that it has made customers more open to longer-term commitments.“Normally everybody sort of plans their worlds separately, and now we’re really having to plan our worlds together,” she said.She predicts supply of AMD chips, which are built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., will improve throughout 2021.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-ceo-lisa-su-says-213000094.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-05-19	2021-05-19 15:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Ampere Says Microsoft, Tencent Are Customers, Unveils New Design	(Bloomberg) -- Ampere Computing, a startup aiming to make a dent in Intel Corp.’s dominance of the lucrative server chip market, said it has signed up big customers including Microsoft Corp. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. and has a new design on the way.Microsoft Azure, Tencent Cloud, and TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance Ltd. are among those using Ampere’s Altra processors, according to founder and Chief Executive Officer Renee James. The former Intel executive says she has other large customers too.Beginning next year, Ampere will offer a new chip that features processor cores designed in house, James said. That’ll help the company tailor its products to the needs of hyperscalers, providers of computing over the internet, who build giant data centers to meet the growing need for cloud services. Ampere’s current products use cores licensed from SoftBank Group Corp.’s Arm Ltd. The new chips will retain software compatibility with that technology, she said.Ampere’s announcement raises its prominence in the race to provide the backbone of new systems being built to run artificial intelligence software that can make sense of the increasing flood of data created by smartphone and internet traffic. The Santa Clara, California-based company, backed by an investment from Oracle Corp., is one of a group of companies trying to shake Intel’s hold on a market where individual chips can sell for as much as the price of a compact car.To read more about Ampere: Startup Ampere Offers Server Processor With Huge Core CountSo far, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., run by the only other female leader of a chip company, Lisa Su, is the only one to show significant gains against Intel, which until recently had a market share of more than 99%. Ampere and internal efforts by Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS are leading the push to bring Arm technology, which is pervasive in smartphone silicon, to more powerful computer systems.Proponents of that approach argue that scaling up mobile chips results in much more efficient solutions. The amount of computing that can be crammed into an individual data center is increasingly running up against the limits of electricity available to power and cool servers, with processors being one of the major sources of demand for energy.Ampere claimed its current products beat the best offerings from Intel and AMD in performance and efficiency, in an online presentation given early Wednesday. Those companies design chips for a broad range of uses, which makes them less effective in cloud computing James said.“We can do things faster and move forward better than the broad-based approach,” she said. “Customers wait for no man. You have to move forward on a pretty specific cadence.”Ampere is using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to outsource its production and the chips coming next year will be made with 5-nanometer technology. Ampere is generating revenue from its products now and has secured enough financial backing to be able to self-fund development of future generations of chips, James said.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ampere-says-microsoft-tencent-customers-150000769.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-19	2021-05-19 07:06:14	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Chip Crisis in ‘Danger Zone’ as Wait Times Reach New Record	(Bloomberg) -- Shortages in the semiconductor industry, which have already slammed automakers and consumer electronics companies, are getting even worse, complicating the global economy’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.Chip lead times, the gap between ordering a chip and taking delivery, increased to 17 weeks in April, indicating users are getting more desperate to secure supply, according to research by Susquehanna Financial Group. That is the longest wait since the firm began tracking the data in 2017, in what it describes as the “danger zone.”“All major product categories up considerably,” Susquehanna analyst Chris Rolland wrote in a note Tuesday, citing power management and analog chip lead times among others. “These were some of the largest increases since we started tracking the data.”Chip shortages are rippling through industry after industry, preventing companies from shipping products from cars to game consoles and refrigerators. Automakers are now expected to lose out on $110 billion in sales this year, as Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and others have to idle factories for lack of essential components. That’s undercutting economic growth and employment, as well as raising fears of panic ordering that may lead to distortions in the future.The chip industry and its customers watch lead times as an indicator of the balance between supply and demand. A lengthening of the gap indicates that buyers of semiconductors are more willing to commit to future supply to avoid a recurrence of shortfalls. Analysts track these numbers as a harbinger of hoarding that can lead to the accumulation of too much inventory and sudden declines in orders.“Elevated lead times often compel ‘bad behavior’ at customers, including inventory accumulation, safety stock building and double ordering,” Rolland wrote. “These trends may have spurred a semiconductor industry in the early stages of over-shipment above true customer demand.”The situation has been complicated by a resurgence of coronavirus cases in Taiwan, a key location for chip manufacturing. The country has closed schools, curbed social gatherings, and shut museums and public facilities. While businesses and factories are operating, the government may have to consider broader restrictions.The country is home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which is the world’s most advanced chipmaker and counts Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. among its many customers. Local manufacturers also produce less glamorous -- but equally critical -- chips, such as display driver ICs that have been a particularly painful bottleneck for global production.On Wednesday, Taiwan’s Centers for Disease Control raised the island-wide alert level, extending Covid-containment measures to the whole country. The same day, the Water Resources Agency said Taiwan needs to tighten water-saving measures because little rain has fallen during the traditional rainy season, aggravating a drought that has also threatened production.TSMC said in a statement that it will continue to tighten its water usage and does not anticipate the measures will affect its operations.In his report, Rolland wrote that the current wait level of 17 weeks climbed from the 16-week level and marks a fourth consecutive month of “sizable” expansion.Lead times for certain products are increasing sharply, even after months of shortages. Power management chips, for example, spiked to 23.7 weeks in April, a wait time about four weeks longer than a month earlier, according to Susquehanna. Industrial microcontrollers order lead times extended by three weeks, some of the steepest increases Rolland has seen since he began tracking the numbers in 2017, he wrote.Delays are often worse for smaller manufacturers, with headphone makers facing lead times longer than 52 weeks, according to people familiar with the supply chain. This has forced companies to redesign products, shift priorities and, in at least one case, completely abandon a project, said one of the people, asking not to be named because the information is not public.About 70% of the companies that Rolland tracks have expanding lead times, compared with 20% that have seen lead times contract. NXP Semiconductors NV, a major auto chip supplier, has lead times of more than 22 weeks now, up from around 12 weeks late last year. STMicroelectronics NV, another key auto chip supplier, saw lead times rise by more than four weeks in April to more than 28 weeks.Such outsized increases may reflect over-ordering by some customers, who could be concerned about the impact of shortages on their businesses. Historically, companies have been able to cancel chip orders without penalty, although that has begun to change.“Beginning with January data, we have witnessed numerous large JUMPS in reported LTs,” Rolland wrote, referring to lead times. “Whereas in prior years, an individual company would typically move their stated LTs up and down just a few days in a given month, starting this year we have seen significant jumps in LTs that have skewed our data.”(Updates with Taiwan coronavirus measures in ninth paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wait-chip-deliveries-increased-sign-220008762.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-05-19	2021-05-19 01:42:31	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Taiwan Aims to Keep Chip Production Humming as Covid Spreads	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan’s government pledged to try to keep the world supplied with chips even as Covid-19 cases escalate, while anticipating a limited impact from its worst outbreak so far.If only domestic consumption is hit, and the outbreak ends by June 30, gross domestic product growth may be cut by 0.16 percentage points, National Development Council Minister Kung Ming-hsin said at a briefing in Taipei today. If the outbreak extends into the third quarter, the hit could be 0.53 points. But the economy could still expand over 5% this year, said Kung, whose agency isn’t responsible for assessing GDP.The government in February raised its forecast for GDP growth to 4.64%, betting that a global scramble for semiconductors will boost exports. But that was before an explosion of coronavirus cases this month, compounded by the impact of a worsening drought and periodic power cuts. U.S. officials and executives have voiced concerns about the world’s dependence on chips from the island, which hosts the highest-end facilities of industry linchpins Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and ASE Technology Holding Co.Taiwan, which added 240 locally transmitted cases today, has closed schools, curbed social gatherings, and shut many adult entertainment venues, museums and public facilities. Businesses and factories are operating, but the government has required them to allow parents to take time off to care for their children, and to ensure adequate social-distancing and masks.Chip Crisis Gets Even Worse as Wait Times Reach Record 17 Weeks“The impact on consumption is obvious, because restaurants and the service sector have been required to observe more strict social-distancing,” said Rick Lo, Fubon Financial Holding Co.’s chief economist. “In manufacturing, for now it’s still safe, but if the situation gets worse then workers might not be able to work in the factories. The downside risk is increasing and it really depends on how quickly the outbreak is controlled.”Kung said the government is asking companies to adopt various measures to help fight Covid, including setting up task forces to monitor developments, acting to control the flow of staff and visitors, and tightening controls on the movement of migrant workers.Taiwan’s benchmark stock index swung between gains and losses on Wednesday. The gauge has fallen almost 9% from an April peak amid concerns over the economic impact of escalating Covid-19 cases, subsequent movement curbs and forced selling by retail investors facing margin calls from brokerages.TSMC, which dominates advanced chip production, yesterday said its workers are operating in separate teams. Face-to-face meetings have been curbed, and non-essential vendors were banned from its facilities.Keeping up production is critical not just for Taiwan’s growth, but because the island is the world’s main supplier of advanced computer chips, which are in demand as the pandemic up-ends working arrangements and consumer goods become smarter.When asked if Taiwan will prioritize orders from U.S. automakers as Washington is requesting, Kung said they’ll try to meet global car-chip orders as much as possible.Chip companies have tightened controls on the movement of staff, including not allowing them to travel between different sites, Chou Chung-pin, secretary-general of the Industrial Development Bureau at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said at the same briefing.Yet there are already concerns about the outbreak’s impact on exports, the value of which surged 38.7% in April from a year earlier to the second-highest total ever after March’s record, mainly driven by surging chip sales.China Airlines Ltd. last week said its airfreight capacity will be cut by 10% as a result of new Covid-related rules, imposed after its pilots were linked to the rapidly growing outbreak.Then there’s the drought, which is forcing farmers and chip companies to try and lock in supplies of water, and leaving hydropower plants operating at limited capacity. A dual coal- and gas-fired plant went offline Thursday due to a technical error, and consumers across the island yesterday got mobile phone alerts ahead of yet another round of rolling blackouts.(Adds Taiwan share moves in seventh paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-aims-keep-chip-production-092219216.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-14	2021-05-14 10:41:35	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Taiwan Semiconductor To Ramp Up US Chip Investment: Reuters	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (NYSE: TSM) plans to channelize incremental billions of dollars into the Arizona chip factories from its previously disclosed plans, Reuters reports. TSM remains indifferent regarding the European plant plans. Last year, TSM had announced an investment of $10 billion and $12 billion in the Phoenix chip factory. The company now plans around five additional fabs in Arizona apart from the current one. Opinions remain divided over the next plant focus between the advanced 3-nanometer chipmaking technology and the slower, less-efficient 5-nanometer technology used for the first factory. The 3-nanometer plant could cost between $23 billion and $25 billion. TSM could join the likes of Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTC: SSNLF) to seek subsidies from the U.S. government. President Joe Biden has sought billion in funding for domestic chip manufacturing. However, concerns about the misuse of the subsidies remain for higher R&D plans in favor of Taiwan instead of U.S. interests. Interestingly, European chip and auto companies seek subsidies for the short supply of older-generation chips used by car manufacturers. TSM’s European customer base comprises mainly less advanced chips utilized by automakers. TSM is still open to the possibility of an older-generation auto chip plant in Europe. TSM has hired Intel veteran Benjamin Miller as human resources head in Arizona. It has hired 250 engineers, out of which 100 have been sent to Tainan, Taiwan, for a training program. TSM’s first Arizona factory will have an estimated output of 20,000 wafers of 12-inch silicon discs that can each contain thousands of chips per month. However, TSM’s fabs in Taiwan can produce 100,000 wafers per month. Price action: TSM shares traded higher by 1.67% at $110.57 in the premarket session on the last check Friday.

2021-05-14	2021-05-14 08:15:34	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Human Error and Shaky Grid Spark New Global-Chip Supply Concerns	(Bloomberg) -- Human error and worst-case scenarios triggered a widespread power outage in Taiwan, rocking its reliability as a top supplier of computer chips as the industry grapples with a global shortage.A dual coal- and gas-fired power plant in the southern city of Kaohsiung went offline Thursday after a technician accidentally flipped the wrong switch, resulting in a sudden drop in voltage that caused the plant to shut down as a protective measure, state-run utility Taiwan Power Co. said in a statement Friday.The failure came at precisely the wrong time, overloading an electricity grid already stretched by rising temperatures, a water shortage, volatile solar output and higher-than-expected power consumption, and snowballed into a blackout that hit Taiwan’s major cities, including Taipei. The outage temporarily affected more than 4 million households and nearly half of Taiwan’s industrial parks before power was restored Thursday night.The fragility of the power grid has now become a global issue. Taiwan is home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, and a few hours without electricity is enough to disrupt global supply chains.A worldwide shortage of high-end semiconductors has heightened concerns, triggering a scramble among major companies, from consumer electronics brands to automakers, to secure scarce supplies of chips from TSMC and its domestic peers. The blackout may also heighten scrutiny of the government’s effort to rid Taiwan of nuclear and coal, which opponents see as reliable sources of power.If a semiconductor fabrication plant “is suddenly halted by a power outage, can lose what is equivalent to about one month of output,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum. “It’s not just the wafers in fabrication that have to be abandoned, all machines have to put in idle for maintenance and re-calibration.”TSMC, the world’s top foundry, experienced a brief power dip at some facilities, but the supply is currently back to normal, the company said in an emailed statement. There was no major impact on its operations, a spokeswoman said. ASE Technology Holding Co., the world’s largest chip packaging provider, said Thursday that its operations were affected and the full impact has yet to be determined.Analysts see little likelihood of TSMC being affected by similar shortages in the future, even as it consumes more electricity due to new power-hungry extreme ultraviolet lithography chip-making technology, as the government is likely to prioritize its resource needs over other users.“It is also going to be challenging for TSMC’s customers to diversify their orders as right now most chipmakers are running at full capacity,” said Elsa Cheng, an analyst at GF Securities. “Further, TSMC offers superior yield rate compared to its rivals, a critical element that will ensure its customers can launch their products on time.”In a statement apologizing for the incident, Taipower said that electricity consumption exceeded the company’s initial estimates due to high temperatures and strong economic activity. The incident occurred in the afternoon, when solar output was falling, while a water shortage meant that hydropower generation was weak, according to Taipower. Power consumption has steadily climbed since the start of May, the utility said, promising to review its operations.“Blackouts and reliability problems could become worse in Taiwan,” said Alex Whitworth, head of Asia-Pacific power and renewables research at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. The share of intermittent wind and solar power is expected to continue growing, which could put much more stress on the power system, he said.Four years ago, a blackout caused by a blunder at Taiwan’s biggest gas-fired plant affected six million households and disrupted some semiconductor production.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/human-error-shaky-grid-spark-081534295.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-13	2021-05-13 07:21:51	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Korea Unveils $450 Billion Push for Global Chipmaking Crown	(Bloomberg) -- South Korea unveiled ambitious plans to spend roughly $450 billion to build the world’s biggest chipmaking base over the next decade, joining China and the U.S. in a global race to dominate the key technology.Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. will lead more than 510 trillion won of investment in semiconductor research and production in the years to 2030 under a national blueprint devised by President Moon Jae-in’s administration. They’ll be among 153 companies fueling the decade-long push, intended to safeguard the nation’s most economically crucial industry. Moon got a briefing from chip executives on the initiative Thursday during a visit to the country’s most advanced chip factory, a Samsung plant south of Seoul.Samsung is boosting its spending by 30% to $151 billion through 2030 while Hynix is committing $97 billion to expansion at existing facilities in addition to its $106 billion plan for four new plants in Yongin, co-Chief Executive Officer Park Jung-ho said during the event.“Major global competitors are pressing ahead with massive investment to be the first to take the future market,” Moon said in a speech. “Our companies have been taking risks and innovating as well and have completed preparations for tumultuous times.”The effort comes at a time when the U.S., China and the European Union seek to shore up their semiconductor capabilities after a global chip shortage exposed a reliance on just a handful of Asian manufacturers and hobbled efforts to repair pandemic-scarred economies. The shortages are now spreading from autos to smartphones and displays, elevating semiconductors onto the agendas of governments from Washington to Brussels and Beijing.At stake is a technology fundamental to groundbreaking advances from artificial intelligence to autonomous vehicles and connected homes. South Korea, a security ally of the U.S. and a major exporter to China, has been walking a tightrope between the two while bolstering its own production prowess. Semiconductors account for the largest share of South Korea’s exports and chip exports are expected to double to $200 billion by 2030, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said.Read more: Biden Finds a Key Ally Wary of His Bid to Outpace China on ChipsLikening semiconductors to rice -- a global dietary staple -- the ministry called them “strategic weapons” in a race for superior technology intensifying among not just firms but also nations.The government seeks to build a “K-semiconductor belt” that stretches dozens of kilometers south of Seoul and brings together chip designers, manufacturers and suppliers, according to the ministry.Samsung and Hynix make the majority of the world’s memory chips, basic semiconductors that handle storage for all devices. But one area South Korea has been lagging in is the ability to produce advanced logic chips that handle complex calculations for tasks like AI and data processing, a specialty dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes Apple Inc.’s iPhone processors. Samsung aims to compete more aggressively in this area, securing some of Nvidia Corp.’s graphics card business and pursuing a bigger share of Qualcomm Inc.’s mobile chips. Hynix too has announced ambitions to get into logic chips.Read more: Data Centers Doubling Is Next Driver of Chip Demand, Hynix SaysThe Korean government will incentivize its domestic industry with tax breaks, lower interest rates, eased regulations and reinforced infrastructure, hoping to see its chipmakers make up the distance from the global leaders, the ministry said. The government will also secure adequate water supply for the next 10 years in the targeted region and reinforce power supplies, both essential to advanced chipmaking factories.Korea’s blueprint echoes efforts underway around the world. President Joe Biden wants to dedicate $50 billion to U.S. semiconductor research and production, part of an overall ambition to safeguard America’s supply chains. And China has earmarked hundreds of billions of dollars toward developing its own chipmaking industry, wary of a reliance on Western-designed imports.South Korea also aims to attract additional foreign investment in advanced technology. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML Holdings NV signaled it intends to spend 240 billion won to build a training center in Hwaseong while California-based Lam Research Corp. plans to double its capacity in the country, the ministry said.”South Korea is essentially beckoning global suppliers to come and work with its homegrown chipmakers so it can build an ecosystem on its soil rather than see them relocate to the U.S. and elsewhere,” said Kim Yang-paeng, semiconductor analyst at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade. “Broadening its investment to foundries and logic chips also guarantees that it has something to fall back on should anything go wrong with the memory chip industry that it’s dominant in.”In terms of direct contributions, the country wants to help train 36,000 chip experts between 2022 and 2031, contribute 1.5 trillion won toward chip research and development and will start discussing legislation tailored to assist the semiconductor industry.(Updates with quotes from president and analyst from fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/korea-unveils-450-billion-push-060000144.html?.tsrc=rss

That’s after hitting another record just last week after surprisingly weak U.S. jobs data eased some fears about inflation and a cutback in stimulus.“Investors’ tendency to look at just the good side of things is quickly fading,” said Shogo Maekawa, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo. “People were inclined to buy technology stocks even after weak U.S. jobs data on the view that any exit in monetary policies is far away. But now, a deep-rooted concern over inflation is leading to declines in technology stocks.”In Asia, Chinese tech giants have borne the brunt of the sector’s retreat this month, after regulators expanded an antitrust crackdown and announced steps to rein in the companies’ fast-growing finance units.Meituan stock plunged as much as 8.7% on Tuesday, taking the slump over two days to 15%, after the Chinese e-commerce giant’s business practices were criticized by an influential consumer advocacy group, just days after the company’s CEO shared and then deleted a poem on social media that some interpreted as a veiled criticism of Beijing.Herald van der Linde, HSBC Holdings Plc’s head of Asia Pacific equity strategy, says they turned neutral on China’s internet sector in November arguing that this might be the “single biggest issue” in 2021.“Sometimes, Asian stock markets get carried away by what we can call ‘big market delusions,’ they believe that growth in sectors will continue,” he said. “But then, these stocks can turn suddenly and de-rate even while growth remains strong.”(Updates to add European stocks and Nasdaq 100 futures in 2nd paragraph, comment in 5th.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-tech-selloff-deepens-chinese-042344622.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-10	2021-05-10 18:47:45	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Biden Team Amps Up Chip-Crisis Response With Raimondo Summit	(Bloomberg) -- Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo plans a summit with companies impacted by the global semiconductor shortage, including the largest chip manufacturers and U.S. automakers, according to people familiar with the plans.Raimondo will convene the meeting on May 20, according to an invitation sent to companies and obtained by Bloomberg News. The Commerce Department said in the invitation that it aims to create and maintain “an open dialogue around semiconductors and supply chain matters” and wants to bring together suppliers and consumers of chips.Companies invited to the virtual summit include Intel Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Google, Amazon.com Inc., General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., people familiar with the matter said.The White House and a Commerce Department spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Raimondo last week reiterated that the administration is unlikely to come up with a rapid solution for the shortage that’s idled auto plants around North America and has led to production delays for consumer electronics and medical devices.“We are working on it but there is no quick fix,” she said at the White House on Friday after meeting with President Joe Biden and other members of the cabinet on infrastructure.“We’re in constant contact with the auto companies, the semiconductor companies, we’re going to try to do what we can to ease the shortage short-term but in the long run the solution is to be less reliant on China and Taiwan and making more chips in America,” she added.As part of his infrastructure plan, Biden has proposed $50 billion in semiconductor research and development funding. The measure has bipartisan support on Capitol Hill and could potentially move as part of a broader China competitiveness bill that is likely on a faster timeline than Biden’s proposal.The president and senior aides last month convened a meeting on semiconductor supply chain issues at the White House. Many of the companies that participated in that summit are expected to be in attendance at the meeting with Raimondo.Commerce Department staff are set to meet this week with company representatives to craft the agenda for the Raimondo summit, according to people familiar with the matter.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-team-amps-chip-crisis-184745233.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-06	2021-05-06 04:01:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Chip Shortage Forces Carmakers to Leave Out Some High-End Features	(Bloomberg) -- When automakers were first hit with chip shortages at the end of last year, they tried idling factories until the troubles blew over. But with the crisis stretching into its fifth month and getting worse, they’re getting creative to keep at least some production moving forward.Nissan is leaving navigation systems out of thousands of vehicles that typically would have them because of the shortages. Ram no longer offers its 1500 pickups with a standard “intelligent” rearview mirror that monitors for blind spots. Renault has stopped offering an oversized digital screen behind the steering wheel on its Arkana SUV -- also to save on chips.The crisis is an historic test for the century-old auto industry just as it is trying to accelerate a shift toward smarter, electric vehicles. For decades, carmakers moved steadily to include more and better advanced features; now, they’re stripping some of them out -- at least temporarily -- to salvage their sales.That rollback underscores the depth of the issues facing the industry. Just last week, BMW AG, Honda Motor Co. and Ford Motor Co. all flagged worsening problems from chip shortages. A failure to secure critical supplies is a massive short-term setback -- millions of vehicle sales will be lost this year -- and bodes ill for the future as competition from tech-savvy internet and consumer-electronics companies intensifies.“This probably gets worse before it gets better,” said Stacy Rasgon, who covers the semiconductor industry for Sanford C. Bernstein. “It just takes a long time to bring this capacity online.”NXP Semiconductor NV Chief Executive Officer Kurt Sievers said the shift to electric vehicles is happening faster than anticipated, which has added to the increased demand for automotive chips. NXP plans to ship at least 20% more auto chips by revenue in the first half of 2021 compared with the first half of 2019, even though car production has dropped about 10% over the period, he said.Mark Liu, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., cautioned the crisis is far from over. His company, which is the world’s most advanced chipmaker and will be critical to any resolution, will begin to meet auto clients’ minimum requirements by June, but expects the car-chip shortages could last until early 2022, he said in an interview with CBS.Automakers can’t just wait. One reaction to the shortage is to allocate the scarce components to more profitable and better-selling vehicles at the expense of other models -- something manufacturers like France’s Renault SA and Japan’s Nissan Motor Co. are doing.Carmakers are also building vehicles with less technology. Peugeot is going back to old-fashioned analog speedometers for its 308 hatchbacks, rather than use digital versions that need hard-to-find chips. General Motors Co. said it built some Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks without a certain fuel-economy module, costing drivers about 1 mile per gallon. Nissan is cutting the number of vehicles with pre-installed navigation systems by about a third, according to a person familiar with the matter.Why Can’t We Just Make More Chips?The Japanese manufacturer, which in early January became one of the first automakers to warn of an impending shortage, is also prioritizing chip supply to the two best-selling models in each major market, the person said. In one instance, Nissan flew chip supplies from India to the U.S. on a chartered cargo flight to help production move forward there. A representative for Nissan declined to comment.Buyers of Renault’s sporty Arkana now have to settle for a smaller display without a navigation map, and forgo an option for a phone charger by induction.Stellantis NV -- formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group -- has modified the Ram 1500 pickup so that the digital rearview mirror that usually comes standard is now available only as an upgrade option, according to a person familiar with the matter. The manufacturer is also using parts that don’t require chips from its more basic Ram Classic truck to keep the pricier version moving down the assembly line.“Given the fluid nature of this complex issue, Stellantis employees across the enterprise are finding creative solutions every day to minimize the impact to our vehicles so we can build the most in-demand products as possible,” spokeswoman Jodi Tinson said in an email.The car industry’s predicament dates back to poor planning during the pandemic and limited chipmaking capacity, but it’s been compounded by shrinking available cargo space as the global economy recovers from Covid-19. When automakers can secure orders, their chips often can’t ship.That bottleneck is compounded by the fact that major car-chip makers NXP, Infineon Technologies AG and Renesas Electronics Corp. account for just 40% of supply, with the remaining 60% split between tens of thousands of smaller designers. Those smaller players often lack the influence to get their chips manufactured at foundries when capacity is tight.In at least one case, carmakers are asking a major chipmaker to send microcontrollers that don’t meet standard specifications, a person familiar with the matter said. Those sub-standard chips wouldn’t jeopardize safety essentials, like brakes, the person said, but they could mean in-car entertainment or emissions monitoring systems are more likely to malfunction in extreme weather.Automakers and suppliers can accept whatever chips are available and rewrite the software to give them a new task, said Sig Huber, a consultant at Conway MacKenzie and a former head of purchasing at Fiat Chrysler. Tesla Inc. said last week it alleviated issues by reaching out to new semiconductor suppliers and then quickly writing new firmware for those chips.Stellantis is working on more standardization across its vehicle lineup rather than having to use specific chips for some models, Chief Financial Officer Richard Palmer said on an call with reporters this week.“More standardization and flexibility, which is key when we have supply constraints,” he said. “We’re managing scarcity.”Manufacturers are also stocking incomplete cars, or “building shy” in industry parlance, to keep production lines humming. In Hamtramck, greater Detroit, an area stretching several blocks is filled with Ford F-150 pickup trucks sans some chips. General Motors said it is also storing unfinished vehicles while awaiting semiconductors.Meanwhile, behind the scenes, car suppliers are going to unusual lengths to try to secure chips. A Stellantis partner called JVIS-USA LLC tried to sue NXP in a Michigan court in April in a Hail Mary attempt to get more chips, but a judge rejected its request. Automotive supplier Visteon Corp. flagged that carmakers may seek compensation because of the shortages. In Japan, Toyota Motor Corp. President Akio Toyoda visited a Renesas plant that had suffered a fire to hasten its return to production.Yet no relief is in sight, with even Apple Inc., whose high-specification iPhones and aggressive demands typically place it at the front of the chip-customer line, saying last week it’s starting to feel the pinch. That may leave carmakers wanting even when chip manufacturers eventually manage to increase capacity.“This has the potential to be a longer-term issue,” said Anna-Marie Baisden, an automotive analyst at Fitch Solutions. “This will only be exacerbated as vehicles become technologically advanced and use more chips.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chip-shortage-forces-carmakers-leave-040100188.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-05	2021-05-05 13:33:21	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	EU’s Breton Says Time to Fix ‘Naive’ Approach to Chip Supply	(Bloomberg) -- Europe was naive to outsource so much of its semiconductor design and manufacturing to other regions and needs to redress the balance, the European Union’s top industry official said.Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton said a global chip shortage that’s disrupting the car industry and supplies of electronic goods is proof that it’s time to act.“We want to come back to our former market share of production for the needs of our industry,” Breton said in an interview with Bloomberg News. Europe’s share of semiconductor manufacturing has dropped over the years because the region has been “too naive, too open,” he said.The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, laid out plans Wednesday to diversify supply chains and carry out regular sector reviews to tackle its lack of industrial independence in strategic areas including semiconductors.An analysis it published at the same time showed the region’s semiconductor supply chain is increasingly vulnerable to high barriers to entry in key industries, as well as trade tensions and a heavy reliance on Asian advanced chip manufacturing and U.S. chip design tools.The EU’s response should focus on clawing back design and production of semiconductors that power data processing, communication, infrastructure and artificial intelligence, the paper said.The commission plans to double chip production to at least 20% of world supply by 2030. Breton is trying to rally Europe’s leading chipmakers, research centers and more than a dozen EU governments behind the plans. At least 22 countries have already signed a letter of intent.The alliance will have to decide how to boost the design and production of 20-nanometer to 10-nanometer chips, which are smaller and more powerful than most that are currently manufactured in Europe, Breton said. Advances in manufacturing are measured in nanometers, or billionths of a meter, with smaller and smaller transistors crammed onto silicon wafers.In parallel, the EU will work on plans to produce the next generation of leading-edge chips by 2030. Officials are targeting production below 5-nanometers down to 2-nanometers, an ambitious goal not yet reached by industry leaders Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co.Uphill BattleProducing even 20nm chips will be a challenge for most European semiconductor companies, which have long outsourced production at that scale, said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, head of technology and geopolitics at think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung. He said the companies’ automotive and industrial customers may need to be willing to pay more for chips “made in the EU.”And not all European chip companies are keen to sign up to the EU’s plans. STMicroelectronics NV Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery told BFM TV on Tuesday his firm was unlikely to join the alliance.“If it’s about advanced technologies, we don’t have any reason to participate. That’s marginal to our activities,” said Chery.Europe once accounted for a big chunk of semiconductor manufacturing, but that’s collapsed from a global market share of around 44% in 1990 to closer to 10% today. Taiwan, South Korea and Japan account for about 60% of production, according to the Boston Consulting Group and the Semiconductor Industry Association. European chip designers including NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG now outsource most production to TSMC and other foundry operators. The decline partly reflects the waning of Europe’s consumer technology sector, including the failure of Nokia Corp. and Ericsson AB’s once-popular mobile phones, according to Kleinhans.Now Europe’s auto industry has been hit hard by the global chip shortage. Ford Motor Co. said Monday it would halt output at German plants for several weeks due to a chip shortage, joining a growing list of manufacturers idling factories.While the EU’s semiconductor strategy is aimed at cutting reliance on foreign suppliers, its plan to go below 5 nanometers is so ambitious that the bloc will need help from those same players. Companies like TSMC have dedicated years of research and invested billions of dollars to develop their expertise.“We know that to go there, it will be better to do this with partners,” Breton said of the 2-nanometer goal. He said the strategy is like “going to the moon.”Intel Corp., the world’s largest chipmaker, has backed the EU’s plans. It’s already expanding 7nm production in Europe and is also considering building a state-of-the-art semiconductor foundry in the region. But the company has struggled to advance its manufacturing in recent years, and its CEO suggested last week the company would likely need hefty financial support from European governments to invest in the bloc’s strategy.An Intel spokesman pointed to companies in Asia that get roughly 40% of the costs of building a new factory subsidized by the state. A new factory costs at least $10 billion and it would need two of them in one location to take advantage of economies of scale, the spokesman said.(Updates with EU announcement from fourth paragraph, STMicro and analyst comments)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-looks-secure-chip-supply-040000011.html?.tsrc=rss

That’s a problem,” Raimondo said Tuesday in a virtual conference of the Council of the Americas, a business group. “We ought to be making 30%, because that matches our demand. So, we will promise to work hard every day, and in the short term also see if we can have more chips available so the automakers can reopen their factories.”Reaching 30% would likely take decades of sustained investment. In the shorter term, the Biden administration is in talks with Taiwan and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to prioritize the needs of American automakers to boost supply after a chip shortage led to closed factories and furloughed workers, Raimondo said.Automakers have cut production after a surge in orders for items such as smartphones, TVs and computers left less capacity for a stronger-than-expected rebound in vehicle demand.Raimondo touted Biden’s proposal for a $50 billion fund to build semiconductors. Carmakers are pushing for a portion of the money to be reserved for vehicle-grade chips, warning of a potential 1.3 million shortfall in car and light-duty truck production in the U.S. this year if their industry isn’t given priority.“In the process of building another half a dozen fabs in America, that’s thousands of Americans that get put to work,” Raimondo said.

The company was reworking some of its factories to drive production and counter the chip crisis for the auto industry. The supply chain might take several months to ease down, according to Gelsinger. Global companies expect the supply chain disruption and chip crisis to extend for a major part of 2021. Gelsinger emphasized the U.S.’s global falling semiconductor manufacturing position, which declined from 37% to 12% in twenty-five years. Intel’s high-end, cutting-edge chip manufacturing added to the dismay. Gelsinger also emphasized U.S. manufacturing to drive U.S. jobs and long-term technology control to resolve supply chain constraints. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (NYSE: TSM) Chair Mark Liu expects to cater to the minimum customer requirement by June end. TSM reportedly tried to generate the most possible chips for car companies after hearing about the crisis last year. Liu expects the crisis to intensify by 2021 end or early 2022. Liu said the crisis would continue due to the pandemic irrespective of the production location, in justification of the Asian suppliers accounting for 75% of semiconductor chip manufacturing.

Revenue rose 18% for the period.The Suwon-based conglomerate has been riding a boom in stay-at-home demand for smartphones, PCs, home appliances and cloud services. But Samsung lost out on chip sales when a factory in Austin, Texas, was knocked offline, exacerbating shortages that have hit companies around the world. Just before the company’s results, major automakers Ford Motor Co. and BMW AG warned of deeper-than-expected hits to production because of the shortages. Even Apple Inc. voiced concerns.Samsung said it will step up production to address the shortages and forecast that chip earnings will increase substantially in the second quarter. The company, which makes memory and logic chips, said its Texas plant has resumed normal operations.“We expect our profits to improve significantly” with memory demand from the mobile business likely to be strong even with shortages of other components, said Han Jin-man, executive vice president of the semiconductor business, on a conference call with investors.Samsung’s shares stood mostly unchanged in early Thursday trading in Seoul.The results come as South Korea’s largest company is going through a tumultuous change in ownership. Lee Kun-hee, patriarch of the founding Lee family, died last year, triggering one of the largest inheritance tax bills in history.His heirs said Wednesday they would pay more than 12 trillion won ($11 billion) in taxes and donate approximately 23,000 works of art. They haven’t yet detailed how family members will divvy up ownership of Samsung Electronics and other parts of the conglomerate.After the outage in Texas, first-quarter profit declined at the company’s giant memory chip division, which provides key components for smartphones and servers. But Samsung forecast a strong recovery in the business thanks to server and storage demand, and a rebound in economic activity.Growth in 4K and high-definition streaming services helped maintain strong demand for consumer gear like TVs, said Han.Still, the chip crunch shows signs of disrupting Samsung’s own devices arm. The company warned that both revenue and profit at its mobile division, which produces its marquee Galaxy smartphone line, will slide this quarter because of component shortages and weak demand for flagship models.The mobile display business is likely to see a quarterly slowdown, affected by extended seasonal effects and component shortages.Samsung had previously warned of a serious imbalance in the chips market, while rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said this month that shortages could extend into next year. The Korean company is currently evaluating U.S. sites for an advanced $17 billion plant it hopes will propel its ambitions of competing with TSMC in the pivotal market for made-to-order chips.Samsung elaborated on its ambitions to expand in the foundry business, a lucrative growth segment that TSMC has dominated. It plans to expand supply in the second half of the year through the start of mass production at its Pyeongtaek Line 2, Senior Vice President Shawn Han said.“Although there are concerns that a setback in mobile production following the components shortage may bring a negative effect to memory demand, the chip business sentiment is still very solid,” said Song Myung-sup, analyst at HI Investment & Securities.Shares in Samsung, one of the biggest beneficiaries of last year’s surge in online and mobile activity, have almost doubled from a March 2020 trough.(Updates with outlook from fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-profit-tops-estimates-gadget-234709082.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-04-28	2021-04-28 20:29:24	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Qualcomm Gives Bullish Outlook on Strong Demand for Phones	(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc., the world’s largest smartphone chipmaker, gave a bullish forecast for the current quarter, buoyed by surging demand for 5G handsets. The stock rallied more than 5% in extended trading.Revenue will be $7.1 billion to $7.9 billion in the period ending in June, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Profit, excluding certain items, will be $1.55 a share to $1.75 a share. On average, analysts predicted profit of $1.51 on revenue of $7.12 billion.Smartphone demand in countries such as China is surging back as parts of the world return to a more normal life after pandemic lockdowns. Consumers are upgrading their mobile hardware to 5G handsets to take advantage of higher data speeds from the fifth-generation wireless networks. Qualcomm also is seeing more demand from outside the cellular market for “internet of things” devices such as those needed to connect factory equipment and home electronics.That’s a boon for Qualcomm, although revenue gains are being limited by supply issues. The company outsources production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., among others. These partners are struggling to keep up with a resurgence of demand for most types of chips.“There’s more demand than supply across our businesses,” said incoming Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon. Qualcomm has ‘line of sight’ to improving supply and has concentrated available resources to more expensive chips, helping customers and its financial performance, he said.Amon, who has been Qualcomm’s president since 2018, is succeeding CEO Steve Mollenkopf, who is retiring on June 30.Qualcomm shares rose to a high of $146.24 in extended trading after closing at $136.57 in New York. The stock has dropped 10% in 2021.Qualcomm is the biggest maker of chips that connect smartphones to wireless networks and also supplies processors that give the devices their computer-like capabilities. With customers including Apple Inc. and Samsung, the company’s projections are a closely watched indicator of the health of the mobile phone market.In the fiscal second quarter, Qualcomm said revenue was $7.94 billion, a gain of 52% from a year earlier. Analysts, on average, projected $7.63 billion. Net income was $1.76 billion, or $1.53 a share. Excluding certain items, profit was $1.90 a share, compared with Wall Street’s average estimate of $1.67.Three months ago, Qualcomm said revenue would decline in the fiscal third quarter from the preceding period citing seasonal patterns in customer ordering.(Updates with share gain in the first paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-gives-bullish-outlook-strong-200355154.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-27	2021-04-27 21:46:08	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	AMD Gives Bullish Forecast, Raises 2021 Revenue Outlook	(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave a strong second-quarter sales forecast indicating the chipmaker is taking market share from Intel Corp. amid robust demand for personal computers and servers.Second-quarter revenue will be about $3.6 billion, plus or minus $100 million, in the period ending in June, Santa Clara, California-based AMD said Tuesday in a statement. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $3.28 billion.Investors have poured money into the stock, betting that new products, including its Epyc server chips, and stumbles by Intel present an opportunity for AMD. Intel reported data-center revenue that dropped 20% in the first quarter, leading many analysts to project that it was losing sales to its smaller rival in the most profitable part of the market for computer processors. AMD said its server business surged in the quarter.“We delivered another quarter of record server-processor revenue, as Epyc processor sales more than doubled year-over-year and grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially,” AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su told analysts on a conference call. “We expect data center product revenue to grow significantly as we go through the year, driven by our strong pipeline of new cloud, enterprise and HPC (high-performance computing) wins.”Three months ago she forecast that the company’s revenue would grow 37% this year. On Tuesday, AMD lifted that prediction to a 50% gain in 2021. Prior to the call, Wall St. had been projecting an annual gain of 39%.The bullish outlook has prompted questions about whether AMD can get enough chips to meet demand amid industry-wide shortages at the company’s outsourced manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Su said the company has ‘good visibility’ to additional supply coming in the second half that supports the company’s improved forecast for the balance of the year.AMD competes with Intel in processors for personal computers and servers and has struggled to get more than 20% market share for much of the 50 years they’ve been competing. It also supplies graphics chips used in Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox and Sony Corp.’s PlayStation and competes with Nvidia Corp. in PC GPUs.Last week, Intel’s report caused a slump in its shares. Executives pinned the large decline in Intel’s data center business on a slowdown in orders by companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS that are working through stockpiles of chips before ordering more, they said.AMD reported first-quarter net income of $555 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with $162 million, or 14 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 93% to $3.45 billion. Profit, excluding certain items, was 52 cents. Analysts were looking for profit of 44 cents on sales of $3.21 billion.AMD shares rose about 4% in extended trading after closing at $85.21. The stock has slipped 7% this year, paring a surge over the last five years. It ended 2015 at $2.87.(Updates with CEO comments from fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-gives-bullish-forecast-raises-202741601.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-26	2021-04-26 19:08:46	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Semiconductor Chip Crisis Extends To Washing Machine, Toasters: FT	The growing semiconductor chip crisis has extended to smartphone, television, and home appliance manufacturers from rising stockpiling, Financial Times reports, based on Asian manufacturers. What Happened: The pandemic-induced demand spike in electronics and production facility outages further squeezed the chip supplies. Stockpiling of the Chinese companies affected by U.S. embargoes in anticipation of further restrictions played an important role. All of the above translated into a chip crisis for everyday electronics like washing machines and toasters, affecting the likes of South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTC: SSNLF) and LG Electronics Inc (OTC: LGEIY) (OTC: LGEJY). The manufacturing delays are estimated to last until 2022. Samsung reduced orders for some smartphone components in April after its warning regarding grave supply and demand disparity for semiconductors. Supply crisis in application processors, display drivers, and camera sensors led to falling orders from Samsung in the current quarter. The scenario was expected to improve from the bulk volume of the delayed orders in the second half. Why It Matters: Samsung’s mobile business Co-CEO warned regarding possible problems from the chip crisis in the second quarter, including the possible postponement of its high-end smartphone launch until next year. LG was closely tracking the situation as they were also vulnerable to production disruption risk. TV makers had to hike prices due to rising material costs based on a small TV maker from Seoul. Production of low-margin processors for washing machines or toaster was affected due to the crisis of microcontroller units and manufacturers’ focus on high-margin products. South Korean foundries failed to meet the demand surge despite the entire capacity operation. Smartphone, TV, and other home appliance chip demand surpassed the manufacturing capacity of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) supplier DB HiTek following supply crisis of display driver chips, power management chips, and image sensors. The crisis led to order placement with multiple chipmakers. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (NYSE: TSM) operated at over 100% capacity and expected the chip crisis to loom until 2022. TSM earmarked 0 billion over three years for capacity expansion. Taiwan’s memory chip maker Nanya Technology Corp (OTC: NNYAF) announced plans to build a $10 billion plant to control the crisis and tap the growing demand for 5G-related components. Analysts expect the crisis to be resolved once the electronics spend declines with the pandemic withdrawal, defining the real demand and induced demand. Price action: TSM shares traded higher by 1.91% at $120.91 on the last check Monday.

2021-04-23	2021-04-23 13:50:49	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Falls Most in Three Months on Data Center Sales Slump	(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp., the biggest chipmaker, fell the most in three months after reporting a drop in data center revenue and a steep decline in gross profit margin, a sign it’s losing market share to rivals and customers who are designing their own components.The PC business performed better on continued demand for laptops that run Intel processors. But the company’s Data Center Group generated first-quarter sales that fell 20% from a year earlier and missed Wall Street estimates. The unit is Intel’s most profitable businesses, so the lower revenue dented overall margins.New Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger inherited a company that’s struggling with production technology that was once the foundation of its industry dominance. Delays have allowed other chip companies to catch up and tempted customers to design their own components. Intel argued the server business is going through a temporary slump caused by too much inventory. The first quarter was the bottom and growth has returned, executives said.That didn’t diffuse questions from analysts on a conference call focused on whether Intel is losing market share and when profitability will start to expand. Gelsinger said Intel is now in “investment mode” during a critical period for its return to leadership, and promised he’ll deliver products that are again the best in the industry.“The days of Intel having a stranglehold on this business have gone,” said Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward D Jones & Co. “The competitive landscape has shifted and it’s shifted quickly. That is going to weigh on this business.”Intel said its gross margin, the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of production, was 55.2%, down more than five percentage points from the same period in 2020. This is a key indicator of the strength of its manufacturing and product pricing. Intel has historically delivered margins above 60%.The shares fell as much as 7.5% to $57.90 as trading opened Friday in New York. It was the biggest drop since Jan. 22. Investors had been optimistic about Gelsinger’s recovery plan, pushing the stock up 26% this year through Thursday, after it declined 17% in 2020 and lagged far behind its rivals.The Santa Clara, California-based company raised its full-year sales forecast slightly to $72.5 billion. While that’s down from last year’s record $77.87 billion, the company still gets multiple billions of dollars more in sales than faster-growing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. Those companies though, have passed Intel in manufacturing technology and are spending heavily to maintain the gap with budgets the U.S. company will struggle to match, according to Purk of Edward D Jones.Amazon.com Inc. and other big cloud providers are designing more chips in-house for their data centers. These businesses have been major Intel customers for years, so the trend is a concern for the company and investors. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has also rolled out more competitive data center processors recently.Read more: Amazon Is Designing Its Own Chips in Yet Another Blow to IntelIntel said sales of chips to cloud service providers fell 29% from the same period a year earlier. That huge drop, according to Intel, was caused by “digestion” -- customers pausing orders while they work through unused stockpiles of chips.While this has happened before and rebounds have followed, investors are increasingly concerned that delays in new Intel products have led this crucial group of customers to shop elsewhere and they won’t come back.Gelsinger’s revival plan is getting a boost from the PC market, though. The Covid-19 pandemic forced millions of people to work and study from home, driving a surge in purchases of laptops and other computer gear.Intel’s PC chip division had first-quarter revenue of $10.6 billion, up 8% from a year earlier. Analysts projected $10 billion.Gelsinger said there’s no sign of a slowdown in PC demand. The company’s 2021 forecast is constrained by supply shortages, while profitability is being squeezed as costs increase and the company competes aggressively to win market share, he added.“We are here to win and we’re going to be very competitive in our approach to gain market share,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-reports-20-drop-data-210333864.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-20	2021-04-20 18:55:31	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Launches Redesigned iMac Desktop With Colors, Custom Chip	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. rolled out the first redesign of its flagship desktop iMac computer in almost a decade, showcasing its latest machine with in-house designed chips instead of those made by Intel Corp.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant showed off the new iMacs, which come in a new 24-inch screen size, up from 21.5-inches on the previous entry-level model, Tuesday at its product event. The new iMacs are far thinner than their predecessors and have slimmer edges. They also come in seven different colors, have a 1080p camera, better speakers and improved microphones for video conferencing.The computers run Apple’s M1 custom processor that was first released in the MacBook Air, entry-level MacBook Pro and Mac mini last year. By shifting the iMac to its own processors, the company has now replaced Intel chips for its own designs in most of the Mac line. Apple plans to launch higher-end MacBook Pros with its own chips later this year and well as a smaller Mac Pro desktop computer with an Apple processor by next year, Bloomberg News has reported. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. typically makes Apple’s chips. The new iMac starts at $1,299 compared with $1,099 for the previous model with Intel chips. Apple last redesigned the iMac in 2012. The company didn’t announce upgrades to the larger and more powerful iMac models.The new machines also include a upgraded power adapter that can magnetically attach to the back of the iMac and four USB-C ports. The company is also offering three new keyboard options for the new iMacs: a standard color-matched one, a keyboard with a Touch ID fingerprint scanner, and another with a fingerprint scanner and a number pad. The company is also offering new mouses and trackpads that are color-matched to the iMacs.While much of the computer industry focuses on laptops, the iMac remains a key part of Apple’s portfolio. The first iMac, launched in 1998, has been credited with helping Apple escape bankruptcy and steer a path toward becoming the world’s most valuable company. The all-in-one desktop line is popular with professionals and consumers seeking large screens at relatively affordable prices.The launch of new iMacs comes as businesses and schools begin to re-open after vaccines for Covid-19 have become more readily available in some countries. Some business may require new equipment for those returning to the office, which could boost sales of the iMac.The Mac line generated about $8.7 billion in the fiscal first quarter ended in December, the most during a holiday period in years.

2021-04-20	2021-04-20 17:11:37	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	How Taiwan Semiconductor Plans To Address Chip Shortage?	Rising Chip Demand Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. (TSMC) is gearing up towards increasing its manufacturing capacity and cater to the rising demand for semiconductors. The company’s management elaborated on the company’s plans on an earnings call following the release of the 1Q 2021 results. TSMC (TSM) believes that a combination of factors, including the rise in the number of people working from home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, continuing demand for 5G, and high-performance computing (HPC) applications has fuelled semiconductor demand. Chip Shortage Woes TSMC stated at its earnings call that it expects its customers to maintain high levels of chip inventory in FY21 due to chip supply constraints. The company also said that it anticipates its supply capacity to continue to remain tight in the second half of this year. The company foresees the chip shortage continuing into 2022 but expects component shortages for automotive sector customers to be reduced by a great extent in the second quarter. These chip shortage woes could be exacerbated as Taiwan, where TSMC is headquartered, is facing its worst drought in the past 50 years. This could affect semiconductor manufacturing capacity, according to a Wall Street Journal report from April 16. However, at its earnings call, TSMC assured analysts that despite the current orders from the Taiwanese government to reduce water usage, its manufacturing operations had not been affected so far. (See Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co stock analysis on TipRanks) Increasing Capex Spend The company expects to invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase chip manufacturing capacity, support semiconductor manufacturing, and maintain R&D of other advanced technology processes. This includes a capex spend of $30 billion in FY21 which is expected to rise into the “mid-30s” (in billions) over the long term. The company expects to spend 80% of its capex on advanced process technologies including 3-nanometer (nm), 5-nm, and 7 nm. While the company is currently in the process of setting up a 12-inch semiconductor foundry in Arizona and has already completed the installation of the first phase of its 20,000 wafers capacity foundry in Nanjing, China, it currently has no plans to set up its foundries in Europe. TSMC’s Fiscal Outlook In the fiscal second quarter, TSMC expects revenues to range between $12.9 billion and $13.2 billion, “flattish” year-on-year as the company expects demand for HPC chips to grow while being offset by the seasonality factor affecting the demand of smartphones. The company anticipates revenues to grow over the long term from 2020 to 2025 at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of between 10% and 15%. TSMC expects that its N5 chip (5-nm chip) will make up around 20% of its chip revenues in FY21 and expects the demand for the chip to grow even higher. Based on the exchange rate of $1 to NT$28.4, TSMC anticipates gross profit margin to be between 49.5% and 51.5% and operating profit margin to land between 38.5% and 40.5%. TSMC considers a gross margin target of 50% “achievable”. TSMC expects that the market for semiconductors could grow at around 12% (excluding market for memory chips) while the foundry industry could grow by around 16%. However, the company expects to exceed this industry growth and foresees foundry revenue rising by approximately 20% in FY21 in US dollar terms. Wall Street’s Take On April 15, Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini upgraded his price target from $83 to $85 and reiterated a Sell on the stock. Hosseini said that while the rise in capex will drive the growth in revenues, he also anticipates higher depreciation and operating expenses to drag down the CAGR for EPS. Overall, the Street is sidelined on the stock with a Hold consensus rating based on 2 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $83 implies 28.6% downside potential from current levels.

2021-04-20	2021-04-20 15:03:37	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Taiwan's Export Surge From Global Semiconductor Chip Demand: Bloomberg	The 5G and high-performance computing led global semiconductor demand spike, supported by the easing pandemic translated into Taiwan’s fifth consecutive double-digit monthly export order growth, Bloomberg reports. Taiwan’s export orders rose 33.3% to $53.7 billion in March, missing Bloomberg’s 34.9% growth estimate. Higher demand for components for the remote-working device, 5G equipment, high-performance computing, and vehicles drove the growth. The growth trajectory is estimated to roll forward to the sixth month, with growth estimates between 29.8% and 33.7% in April. The National Development Council insinuated towards a booming Taiwan economy based on exports, share prices, and money supply projections reaching an all-time high since 1989, resurging from two years of uncertainty from the U.S.-China trade war and the global pandemic. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (NYSE: TSM) warned last week regarding a global semiconductor chip crisis extension in sectors ranging from automaking to consumer electronics to 2022. TSM raised its sales guidance to 20% for the second quarter. However, the growth could be partially offset by a possible export headwind from a stronger local currency. The Taiwan dollar posted its major two-day jump this year after a recent U.S. Treasury report labeling the Taiwan dollar as undervalued. The Taiwan ministry assured their support to companies catering to traditional industries to better weather the stronger currency. Price action: TSM shares traded lower by 0.13% at $115.25 on the last check Tuesday.

2021-04-19	2021-04-19 09:29:17	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Taiwan Dollar Gains as U.S. Hints at Currency Valuation Pressure	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan’s dollar posted its biggest daily advance since December after a U.S. Treasury report hinted that the Biden administration could exert greater pressure on the island’s central bank to allow the currency to appreciate.The local dollar rose 0.5% to close at 28.205 against the greenback, and was emerging Asia’s best-performing currency for the day. While the Treasury report on Friday didn’t label Taiwan as a currency manipulator, it said the U.S. will initiate “enhanced bilateral engagement” to address what it considers as “structural undervaluation” of the exchange rate.“Despite the relief of not being labeled a currency manipulator, the Treasury report still urged Taiwan authorities to limit FX intervention to exceptional circumstances,” said Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. “This, alongside the strong exports, will help support the Taiwan dollar.”The Taiwan dollar has come under scrutiny as the tech-dependent economy posts a quicker recovery from the pandemic than most of its peers in Asia. Six of the 60 pages in the Treasury report were devoted to Taiwan, more than any other U.S. trading partner, in the Biden administration’s first foreign-exchange policy update.The report cites research published in November 2018 that assesses the Asian currency to be undervalued by as much as 21%. Taiwan made net foreign-exchange purchases of $39.5 billion in 2020, equivalent to 5.9% of its gross domestic product, according to the analysis.While Taiwan’s central bank doesn’t deny intervening in currency markets, it pushed back against aspects of the U.S. assessment. The Taiwan dollar is close to being at a balanced level based on the International Monetary Fund’s valuation model, it said, as it urged the U.S. to ease monitoring of trading partners during the Covid pandemic.Held Meetings“Yellen is pragmatic and prudent,” central bank governor Yang Chin-long told lawmakers Monday, when discussing the Treasury report. “We need to show more than just our sincerity about communicating with the U.S.”Taiwan has already held two meetings with the Treasury this year over its currency, Yang added. The central bank only intervenes when there are concerns about supply and demand in the market, he said.Regular late-session moves by state-backed banks to pare gains by Taiwan’s currency against the dollar are “a kind of intervention,” Governor Yang had told reporters in late March. For months, the currency could rise more than 1% during the day, only to pare back most of the advance at the close.While the U.S. didn’t label any economy as a currency manipulator, it also acknowledged that Taiwan, Switzerland and Vietnam all met the threshold. It insisted that it would maintain pressure on trading partners to redress trade imbalances with the U.S.“There will still be pressure on Asian central banks to ease back on their intervention activity, which would lead to greater appreciation pressure,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “The easing of U.S. 10-year bond yields and the retreat in the dollar of late has also helped the Taiwan dollar’s move.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-hints-more-pressure-come-210000965.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-16	2021-04-16 14:53:29	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Taiwan's Drought Poses Additional Threat To Looming Global Chip Crisis: WSJ	Taiwan’s severe drought could aggravate the ongoing global chip crisis as semiconductor producers required a massive water supply to clean the wafer base, etch patterns, polish layers and rinse components throughout the manufacturing process, the Wall Street Journal reports. Taiwan’s semiconductor wafer-fabrication factories (fabs) accounted for two-thirds of the global manufacturing capacity. Most of that capacity belonged to contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (NYSE: TSM). Taiwan derived most of its water reserves from seasonal typhoons. However, a lack of storms last year had choked supplies, prompting the government to start water rationing for over a million businesses and residents. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTC: SSNLF) had to temporarily shut down two of its Austin chip factories due to Texas weather anomalies. Auto chip manufacturer Renesas Electronics Corp’s (OTC: RNECF) Japanese plant was hampered by the February earthquake and a March fire. Taiwan’s three science industrial parks responsible for most of the chip-making facilities had to limit their water intake but were exempt from stoppages to date. However, it was affecting some of the companies. Alternative sources of water and acceleration of conservation would escalate the production costs after supply to one of its chip facilities were reduced, stated Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MU), which had facilities in Taichung and Taoyuan. Hsinchu-based TSM and United Microelectronics Corp (NYSE: UMC) had secured alternate water supply sources. TSM was also trying to utilize groundwater from their construction sites. TSM did not estimate any significant impact on operations despite the tight water supply. However, Taiwan’s water crisis fueled by climate change could jeopardize global chip production due to their high production concentration in the island country, stated its officials and scholars. Taiwan introduced a drought disaster response agency in October. The government stopped the water supply for two days per week to some parts of the island from April. TSM aimed to reduce its water requirement per unit by 30% from 2010 levels by 2030. TSM accounted for around 4.5% of Taiwan’s GDP in 2018, and chip sales accounted for 64% of Taiwan’s export growth on average over the past five years. Germany has sought Taiwan’s assistance to secure chip supply for German car manufacturers. Price action: TSM shares traded flat at $118.35 on the last check Friday.

But overall deficits of critical semiconductors will last throughout 2021 and potentially into next year, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei told analysts on a conference call.TSMC now expects investments of about $30 billion on capacity expansions and upgrades this year, up from a previous forecast for as much as $28 billion, Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said. It foresees sales in the June quarter at a better-than-projected $12.9 billion to $13.2 billion, driving full-year revenue growth of 20% in dollar terms -- ahead of the “mid-teens” growth predicted in January.But the increased spending means its target for gross margins this quarter came in below expectations at 49.5% to 51.5%, spurring concerns about the longer-term impact on profitability. TSMC’s shares slipped 1.8% in Taipei on Friday, their biggest intraday loss in about three weeks.“The capex boost is a mixed bag with better long-term growth but lower margins,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysLarge depreciation costs from new 5-nm production equipment may lower gross margin by 2%, while slower-than-expected production efficiency improvement implies that gross margin will continue to contract, possibly to under 50% in 2Q.- Charles Shum and Simon Chan, analystsClick here for the research.TSMC joins a growing number of industry giants from Continental AG to Renesas Electronics Corp. and Foxconn Technology Group that warned of longer-than-anticipated deficits thanks to unprecedented demand for everything from cars to game consoles and mobile devices. While Taiwan’s largest chipmaker has kept its fabs running at “over 100% utilization,” the firm doesn’t have enough capacity to satisfy all its customers and it has pledged to invest $100 billion over the next three years to expand.“We see the demand continue to be high,” Wei said. “In 2023, I hope we can offer more capacity to support our customers. At that time, we’ll start to see the supply chain tightness release a little bit.”Read more: See How a Chip Shortage Snarled Everything From Phones to CarsSemiconductor shortages are cascading through the global economy. Automakers like Ford, Nissan Motor Co.and Volkswagen AG have already scaled back production, leading to estimates for more than $60 billion in lost revenue for the industry this year. The situation is likely get worse before it gets better: a rare winter storm in Texas knocked out swaths of U.S. production, while a fire at a key Japan factory will shut the facility for a month. Rival chipmaker Samsung Electronics Co. warned of a “serious imbalance” in the industry.With major American carmakers and other gadget suppliers facing a prolonged shortage of chips, U.S. President Joe Biden has proposed $50 billion to bolster semiconductor research and manufacturing at home. The initiative could aid TSMC’s plan to build a cutting-edge fab in Arizona this year that could cost $12 billion.TSMC is “happy” to support chip manufacturing in the U.S., though research and development and the majority of production will continue to remain in Taiwan, executives said on Thursday. They reiterated that construction of their plant in Arizona will begin this year.Read more: Why Shortages of a $1 Chip Sparked Crisis in Global EconomyNet income for the January-March period climbed 19% to NT$139.7 billion ($4.9 billion), beating the average analyst estimate, buoyed by demand for high-performance computing (HPC) equipment and a milder seasonal effect on smartphone demand. Gross margin for the quarter eased to 52.4% from 54% in the three months prior, due in part to relatively lower levels of utilization and exchange-rate fluctuations. First-quarter revenue rose 17% to NT$362.4 billion, according to a company statement last week.The company said Thursday it now expects to be able to achieve the higher end of its compound annual growth rate target of 10% to 15% for the five years to 2025, citing its investment spending plans.“TSMC’s statement that the chip crunch may spill into 2022 will smooth over concerns that chip demand may fall on overbooking later this year and further boost investors’ confidence in the overall semiconductor demand in the long run,” said Elsa Cheng, an analyst at GF Securities.Shares of TSMC have more than doubled over the past year.TSMC’s most-advanced technologies continued to account for nearly half of revenue in the March quarter, with 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer processes contributing 14% and 35% of sales, respectively. By business segment, its smartphone business amounted for about 45% of revenue, while HPC increased to more than a third, reflecting sustained demand for devices and internet servers even as economies start to emerge from the pandemic.“We are seeing stronger engagement with more customers on 5-nm and 3-nm, in fact the engagement is so strong that we have to really prepare the capacity for it,” Wei said. Smartphones and HPC will be the main drivers for demand of 5-nm, which will contribute around 20% of wafer revenue this year.TSMC Is On Fire.

2021-04-15	2021-04-15 15:56:36	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC’s 1Q Results Beat Estimates; Street Says Hold	Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. (TSMC) today announced results for the fiscal first quarter with revenues up 25.4% year-on-year to $12.9 billion. Analysts were expecting revenues of $12.8 billion. The semiconductor company reported diluted EPS of $0.96 per ADR unit beating consensus estimates of $0.92. TSMC’s (TSM) VP and CFO, Wendell Huang said, “Our first quarter business was supported by HPC-related demand, balanced by a milder smartphone seasonality than in recent years. Moving into second quarter 2021, we expect our revenue to be flattish, as HPC-related demand will continue to grow, offset by smartphone seasonality.” The company reported a gross margin of 52.4% in 1Q and a net profit margin of 38.6%. TSMC stated that wafers of 5-nanometer (nm) made up 14% of the company’s total wafer revenue while 7nm chips comprised 35%. Advanced technologies chips accounted for 49% of TSM’s total wafer revenues. TSM also provided its outlook for fiscal 2Q FY21 and expects revenues to range between $12.9 billion to $13.2 billion. Based on the exchange rate of $1 to NT$28.4, TSM anticipates gross profit margin to be between 49.5% and 51.5% and operating profit margin to land between 38.5% and 40.5%. TSM also expects to incur capex of around $30 billion in FY21. (See Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the earnings announcement, Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini upgraded the price target from $83 to $85 (29% downside potential) and reiterated a Sell on the stock. Hosseini said in a research note, “We are updating our estimates for TSM following the company’s 1Q21 earnings. Although the 3-Yr capex guide of $100B is expected to help drive 10-15% revenue CAGR [compounded annual growth rate] 2020-2025, we expect growth acceleration in depreciation and higher operating expenses to drive lower EPS CAGR.” Shares of TSM have popped 130.6% in the past year. Overall, the Street is sidelined on the stock with a Hold consensus rating based on 1 Buy, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $83 implies a 29% downside at current levels.

Beijing wants to build a world-class home-grown chip industry to wean itself off foreign imports -- an effort that would need ASML’s one-of-a-kind EUV machines. Yet the company faced difficulty getting the Dutch government to renew a license to export the systems to China amid ongoing trade tensions.Wennink said in January that ASML hasn’t shipped its latest EUV machines to China because the request for an export license is still with the Dutch government, adding that there have been ongoing talks between Dutch, the European and the U.S. governments.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asml-ceo-says-trying-control-132050561.html?.tsrc=rss

Alice Cheng, deputy head of the Tainan science park where the plant is based, said an underground power line was accidentally severed during construction work in the late morning but that most supply to all the factories there had resumed as of 7 p.m. (1100 GMT).	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwans-tsmc-says-evaluating-impact-111130839.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-04-14	2021-04-14 09:52:24	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	This Startup Is Building a Chip to Save Traders Vital Microseconds	(Bloomberg) -- In the unfathomably fast realm of high-frequency trading, a South Korean startup’s plan to build a microchip that speeds markets up by a few microseconds is bound to get some attention.The company, Rebellions Inc., was set up six months ago in Seoul by Park Sunghyun, who used to work as a quant developer at Morgan Stanley in New York, with two partners. The chip they’re developing aims to run artificial intelligence more efficiently, which could cut precious millionths of a second off the reaction times of automatic-trading machines.That’s a bold claim in the absence of a completed prototype, but fitting for a company named Rebellions because Park wants to disrupt the industry like the French Revolution upended the European country more than two centuries ago.It could also be a big deal if it pans out. Such is the state of speed in financial markets after traders spent the past decade shaving milliseconds -- or thousandths of a second, an eternity compared with the time scale Rebellions operates in -- off their reaction times by constructing nearly light-speed wireless networks spanning continents and crossing oceans.Since those networks are bumping up against the limits of physics -- nothing in the universe, not even traders’ wireless signals, can go faster than the speed of light -- edges are being found elsewhere. That includes traders trying to coax their machines to process data faster, so orders can be placed quicker.“An AI chip could halve the microseconds needed to make the orders,” said Park, 37, the chief executive officer of Rebellions and holder of a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “There are some companies that just continue to stick to the technology they are used to -- we want to change that.”Quicker AlgoThe technology Rebellions is developing is called an application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC -- a chip designed to do a single thing well, as opposed to general purpose microprocessors like the ones Intel Corp. made famous. This focus could help the Rebellions product run traders’ algorithms more efficiently than alternatives.That’s the idea, anyway.Rebellions is on an “unlimited” hiring spree, aiming to quadruple its 20-person workforce by 2023, Park said. It has gotten 5.5 billion won ($4.9 million) of investments from firms including Kakao Ventures, which is part of messaging giant Kakao Corp., and Shinhan Capital Ltd., a subsidiary of one of Korea’s biggest financial holding companies.“There’s a lot of money in the market with rates so low,” said Park. “South Korea is home to chip giants like Samsung, and the age of artificial intelligence is coming -- it is the perfect time to do business.”Rebellions plans to have a prototype ready in the second half of the year. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, has agreed to begin making the ASICs in 2022. A few investment banks and quantitative trading firms are in talks to use them, Park said. He declined to identify them.Major Competition“Anything that reduces latencies and improves speed will be important and be adopted by the industry,” said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Piper Sandler & Co. in New York. However, with trading speeds already so fast, creating a faster chip “is just not the arms race it was before,” he added.Major traders have in the past taken steps to get microseconds faster. CME Group Inc. runs one of the world’s biggest exchanges out of a data center in Aurora, Illinois, a town near Chicago. DRW Holdings LLC, a big derivatives trader, about half a decade ago attached an antenna on a utility pole beside the CME facility, gaining something like a microsecond edge on competitors whose wireless rigs were on a tower further away.To catch up, another Chicago-based heavyweight, Jump Trading LLC, spent $14 million buying land across the street from the data center -- setting a new benchmark for the value of a microsecond in modern markets.Firms using the Rebellions ASIC could see “significant P&L improvement” from speeding up each trade, Park said, speaking from his experience as one of the operators behind Morgan Stanley’s trading machines for two years.High-speed trading is still in its early stages in Rebellions’ home country of South Korea. But, according to Larry Tabb, head of market structure research at Bloomberg Intelligence, in 2021 it’s accounted for as much as 57% of U.S. stock market volume, where high-frequency traders Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial Inc. are dominant.Park faces competition from other AI-focused ASICs. They include Google’s Tensor Processing Unit, a chip that helps power products like Gmail and Google Translate, and Groq Inc., founded by former members of Google’s TPU team. Intel acquired Habana Labs Ltd. in 2019 to boost its AI-chip prowess.Park is thinking big. After high-frequency trading, he wants to next create chips that speed up cloud services and enable autonomous driving.“Deep learning is going to be a mega trend, and we want to be ready before it comes,” said Park.(Updates with Park’s comments in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/startup-building-chip-save-traders-013724878.html?.tsrc=rss

The chipmaker reached a total funding of $1 billion at a valuation of over $5 billion, making it the third biggest venture capital chip deal in the last twenty years. The recent technology-focused investment, including semiconductors, marks a pronounced shift from Silicon Valley’s decade-long focus on software, social media, and the internet. The global venture capitalists have invested $7.4 billion in technology, including semiconductors, in 2020. SambaNova utilized chips manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (NYSE: TSM) for server and AI software building, leased out to companies for a subscription fee. Interestingly, SambaNova developed its chip architecture. The company had formed a production capacity arrangement with TSM last year to protect itself from the global chip crisis. Rodrigo Liang and Stanford University professors Kunle Olukotun and Chris Ré co-founded SambaNova in 2017. The latest funding round also involved new investors Temasek and the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. The existing investors included BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), Intel Capital (NASDAQ: INTC), Google Ventures (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Walden International. Price action: SFTBY shares traded higher by 0.06% at $46.475 on the last check Tuesday.

2021-04-13	2021-04-13 03:24:05	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Biden Reassures Chip Summit of Bipartisan Support for Funds	(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden told companies vying with each other for a sharply constrained global supply of semiconductors that he has bipartisan support for government funding to address a shortage that has idled automakers worldwide.During a White House meeting with more than a dozen chief executive officers on Monday, Biden read from a letter from 23 senators and 42 House members backing his proposal for $50 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research.“Both sides of the aisle are strongly supportive of what we’re proposing and where I think we can really get things done for the American people,” Biden said. “Now let me quote from the letter. It says, ‘The Chinese Communist Party is aggressively -- plans to reorient and dominate the semiconductor supply chain,’ and it goes into how much money will be they’re pouring into being able to do that.”Chief executives including General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra, Ford Motor Co. CEO James D. Farley, Jr., and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google participated in the virtual summit.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the meeting showed the administration is serious about addressing supply-chain constraints and softening the blow for affected companies and workers.National Economic Council director Brian Deese and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan hosted the meeting, with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo also participating. Companies invited to join included Dell Technologies Inc., Intel Corp., Medtronic Plc, Northrop Grumman Corp., HP Inc., Cummins Inc., Micron Technology Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., AT&T Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., as well as GM, Ford and Alphabet Inc.Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in an interview after the meeting that the White House and Congress are working aggressively to support the semiconductor industry with more domestic manufacturing, research and development as well as efforts to build the workforce. Taiwan’s TSMC also voiced its support. The contract chipmaker, which plays a central role in manufacturing most of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, has secured government incentives to begin building a $12 billion Arizona plant this year.“TSMC is confident that our 5nm advanced fab plan in Phoenix Arizona -- one of the largest foreign direct investments in U.S. history -- will be successful in partnership with the U.S. government,” it said in a statement.The administration intended to highlight elements of the president’s proposed $2.25 trillion infrastructure-focused plan that they believe would improve supply-chain resilience, a White House official said. The agenda also included discussions about the auto industry’s transition to clean energy, job creation and ensuring U.S. economic competitiveness, the official added.Many of the lawmakers supporting additional funding for semiconductors want to see the measure in a standalone competitiveness bill aimed at China, not as part of Biden’s infrastructure package, as it is now. The China bill has some bipartisan support and could have a quicker path through Congress.Intel, Micron, GM, A&T on Roster for White House Chips MeetingBut exactly how to spend and allocate the semiconductor funding is a source of debate among automakers and other consumers of chips, as well as the semiconductor companies themselves.Carmakers are pushing for a portion of the money to be reserved for vehicle-grade chips, warning of a potential 1.3 million shortfall in car and light-duty truck production in the U.S. this year if their industry isn’t given priority.Yet makers of other electronic devices affected by the chip shortage, such as computers and mobile phones, have taken issue with the carmakers’ demands, worried their industries will suffer. The debate was also a factor in the White House meeting.“There were many, many voices saying, ‘hey, we can’t just start carving things up for particular industries. We need a solution that works in the medium and long term and that are sensitive to some of the unique challenges of the immediate term,’” Gelsinger said in the interview. “I think we’re working pretty well through that process right now. Nobody will be entirely happy but we’re heading in a good direction.”The White House has not taken a public position on the issue but has indicated privately to semiconductor industry leaders that it would not support special treatment for one industry, according to people familiar with the matter.Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which lobbies for Ford, General Motors and Stellantis NV (formerly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles), expressed optimism that the Biden administration would at least consider his industry’s arguments.Congress Weighs Countering China on Chips, GOP Wary of Cost (1)He said the White House has not endorsed any specific plans for setting aside money for carmakers, but administration officials “understand why the proposal was made.”To avoid future chip shortages, Blunt’s group proposed that at least 25% of any federal support for the construction of semiconductor factories must go to U.S. facilities that commit to allocating at least 25% of their capacity to automotive-grade chips.John Neuffer, president and chief executive officer of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said the industry understands “the difficulty the auto sector is feeling right now, and chipmakers are working hard to ramp up production to meet demand in the short term.”For the long term, he said, the industry needs a boost in domestic production and innovation across the board “so all sectors of our economy have access to the chips they need, and that requires swiftly enacting federal investments in semiconductor manufacturing and research.”(Updates with TSMC’s comments from the seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-reassures-chip-summit-bipartisan-200759808.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-09	2021-04-09 08:18:36	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	U.S. Blacklists Seven Chinese Supercomputing Firms	(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. added seven Chinese supercomputing firms to a list of entities banned from receiving exports from American companies, citing activities contrary to the national-security or foreign-policy interests of the U.S.The companies were added so-called entity list, which prohibits American firms from doing business with them without first obtaining a U.S. government license, the Commerce Department said in a statement on Thursday. The new entities are involved either with building supercomputers used by China’s military actors, its military modernization efforts or weapons of mass destruction.The entities are Tianjin Phytium Information Technology Co., Shanghai High-Performance Integrated Circuit Design Center, Sunway Microelectronics, the National Supercomputing Center Jinan, the National Supercomputing Center Shenzhen, the National Supercomputing Center Wuxi, and the National Supercomputing Center Zhengzhou, Commerce said. Shares in Phytium suppliers including China Great Wall Technology Group Co. and Taiwan’s Alchip Technologies Ltd. fell as much as 10% Friday.“Supercomputing capabilities are vital for the development of many -- perhaps almost all -- modern weapons and national-security systems, such as nuclear weapons and hypersonic weapons,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in the statement. “The Department of Commerce will use the full extent of its authorities to prevent China from leveraging U.S. technologies to support these destabilizing military modernization efforts.”China firmly rejects U.S. attempts to maintain its monopoly over the high-tech industry and contain the nation by over stretching the concept of national security, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a regular press briefing Friday in Beijing.“U.S. oppression will never stop our progress in high technology,” Zhao said. “It will only make us more determined and resolved in speeding up our innovation.”Thursday’s action doesn’t fully cut off the Chinese firms from U.S. technology. That differs from the action taken against Huawei Technologies Co., where the government applied the so-called foreign direct-product rule to restrict Huawei’s ability to use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and others to fabricate their chips.The Commerce Department’s move will not prevent Phytium from continuing to source from TSMC, a person familiar with the matter said.(Updates with comment from China Foreign Ministry.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-blacklists-seven-chinese-supercomputing-043818752.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-08	2021-04-08 21:01:18	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	The Chip Industry Has a Problem With Its Giant Carbon Footprint	(Bloomberg) -- Day and night, trucks arrive at the Southern Taiwan Science Park to pour concrete for what will become the world’s most advanced chip factory.It’s a giant undertaking that befits the out-sized ambitions of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s go-to chipmaker. The TSMC facility’s estimated cost of $20 billion is about three times that of Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. gigafactory near Berlin.It’ll have a carbon footprint to match.Demand for semiconductors is surging as life becomes increasingly digital, with chips the key component of applications from washing machines to artificial intelligence.But all that computing power comes at a cost. Silicon Valley talks a lot about sustainability, yet the reality is that chip-making is a hugely resource-intensive business.In an October 2020 paper, researchers led by Udit Gupta of Harvard University used publicly available sustainability reports from companies including TSMC, Intel Corp. and Apple Inc. to show that as computing becomes increasingly ubiquitous, “so does its environmental impact.”Information and computing technology is expected to account for as much as 20% of global energy demand by 2030, with hardware responsible for more of that footprint than the operation of a system, they found. “Chip manufacturing, as opposed to hardware use and energy consumption, accounts for most of the carbon output,” the researchers concluded.As implied by the title of the paper — “Chasing Carbon: The Elusive Environmental Footprint of Computing” — that’s a little-known fact, and an uncomfortable one for governments pushing high-end chip making.President Joe Biden’s drive to set up cutting-edge fabrication plants, or fabs, in the U.S. risks colliding with his climate friendly agenda, while the European Union’s plans to build chip production could test its commitment to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.Semiconductor companies broadly acknowledge there’s a footprint issue, although stress the actions they are taking to mitigate their emissions.There’s a paradox at play. The industry touts technological advances that have enabled chips to become incredibly powerful while operating with far greater efficiency, slashing energy use during their lifetime. Yet with billions of transistors now crowded on to a single chip, producing them is increasingly elaborate work.It takes three to four months for a disc of silicon to go through the multiple stages required to process them into the finished product. The wafers make their way along rows of machines that layer on microscopic materials, burn in patterns and scrape off the unneeded portions in procedures that are fully automated. Rinsing with huge amounts of ultrapure water is a key component. And with each new generation, more electricity, water and greenhouses gases are required.The upshot is that the most advanced chipmakers now have a larger carbon footprint than some traditionally more polluting industries. In 2019, for example, company disclosures show that Intel’s factories used more than three times as much water as Ford Motor Co.’s plants and created more than twice as much hazardous waste.“The general trend is the energy consumption is increasing, the water consumption is increasing as all chips become more and more complex,” said Marie Garcia Bardon, a senior researcher at the Imec nanotechnology center in Belgium who does pioneering work estimating aspects of the industry’s carbon footprint.Taiwan with its finite resources is on the horns of the dilemma that poses for both industry and government. TSMC is a major driver of the economy as well as a key player in efforts to overcome a global shortage of chips, hence a strategic asset as Taiwan seeks to keep China, which claims the democratically-governed set of islands at its own, at bay. At the same time, signs of environmental strain raise questions over Taiwan’s vulnerability to climate change — and that of the global semiconductor supply chain.Chip plants in Taiwan called in water trucks earlier this year to ensure supply during a drought caused by the absence of monsoon rains. TSMC’s water consumption has increased almost fivefold in the last decade, and in 2019 amounted to the equivalent of 79,000 full Olympic swimming pools.Power use is more dramatic still: TSMC’s annual electricity consumption is estimated by Greenpeace at 4.8% of Taiwan’s entire usage, and more than that of the capital, Taipei. Greenpeace says that will rise to rise to 7.2% once commercial production comes online of TSMC’s newest fabs that will shrink the process further from the current leading-edge of 5 nanometers, or billions of a meter, to 3nm chips.“For the future of Taiwan’s economic development, the biggest challenge that the electronics industry faces is whether it can bear the weight of its carbon emissions and electricity consumption,” researchers led by Kuei-tien Chou of the National Taiwan University wrote in a paper published in October 2019.TSMC is a key supplier to Apple, and it’s the iPhone maker’s commitment to become carbon neutral by 2030 that is driving much of the change throughout the supply chain. TSMC has pledged to be using 100% renewable energy by 2050, and in July last year signed a deal to buy the full output of a 920MW offshore wind farm to be built in the Taiwan Strait by Orsted AS of Denmark as part of Taiwan’s transition from coal.“TSMC continues to develop more advanced and efficient technologies to reduce energy/resource consumption and pollution per unit during the manufacturing process,” as well as during product use, the company said in a statement, adding that it will continue to increase its renewable energy use and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.The advent of environment, social and corporate governance, or ESG, is forcing chipmakers to respond, according to Kyle Harrison, an analyst at BloombergNEF. For many of them, “the risk is they could lose significant sources of revenue if they don’t start taking ESG reporting and decarbonization more seriously,” he said.The industry is keen to show how hard it’s working to address its emissions.Samsung Electronics Co., which with Intel is TSMC’s only rival at the cutting-edge of chip making, said in a statement that it went 100% renewable for all operations in the U.S., Europe and China, and is adding solar arrays and geothermal power generation to its South Korean campuses at Pyeongtaek and Hwaseong. It’s improving energy efficiency and reducing the use of harmful substances, CEO Kinam Kim said in March. SK Hynix Inc., also of South Korea, issued a $1 billion green bond earlier this year.Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, said that it was already among the top three users of renewable energy in the U.S., and that chip manufacturers have voluntarily reduced carbon emissions for more than 20 years. Intel treats and returns some 80% of the water it uses and has a goal to raise that to 100%.The risk, however, is the overall environmental impact still grows, as chips become a geopolitical pawn in U.S.-China tensions and countries rush to build more advanced fabs to increase self reliance.TSMC said on April 1 that it plans to spend $100 billion over the next three years to expand its fabrication capacity, while Samsung is committing $116 billion over a decade on its foundry business. Intel plans to build two more fabs at a cost of $20 billion in Arizona. China is pumping billions into trying to catch up, and many chipmakers don’t report their emissions.Both the industry and governments stress that semiconductors are key to cutting emissions through innovations such as efficient energy grids and electric vehicles. Digital technology can help reduce global emissions by 15% “and outweigh the emissions caused by the sector,” according to a spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU’s executive.A senior Biden administration official said the U.S. wants new chip facilities to be built where the energy they consume is clean power, such as solar or wind. The president has made his commitment to tackling the climate crisis clear, the official said, citing $35 billion for innovation to help establish the U.S. as a global leader in clean-energy technology.Still, it’s far from easy for big industry players to clean up chip making all the way down the chain.ASML Holding NV, which has a virtual monopoly on the lithography machines required to etch out the most advanced chips, is tackling its direct emissions by using renewable energy for its plants, recycling parts and and making technological advances that boost efficiency. It still projects its overall carbon footprint will grow through 2025 since most of its emissions are so-called scope 3, meaning a large proportion come from the use of its products by customers. In a candid assessment, ASML said in its 2020 annual report that meeting energy savings targets for its latest machines depend on overcoming “strategic technical challenges” that “are particularly tough to solve.”Gary Dickerson, chief executive officer of California-based Applied Materials Inc., the world’s largest maker of chip equipment, said the responsibility lies with industry leaders to ensure that advances made possible by semiconductors are sustainable.The world is “at the biggest inflection of our lifetimes,” he said, contrasting developments with the industrial revolution powered by coal and oil. “It had a very meaningful, positive impact on the world,” he said in an interview. “But the legacy is not so great from a climate change point.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chip-industry-problem-giant-carbon-210118303.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-06	2021-04-06 16:19:32	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Brings Delayed Tech to Server, Ready for ‘Huge Build-Out’	(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp., the world’s largest chipmaker, said it’s offering a revamped version of its Xeon range in time for what it sees as the “biggest build-out of technology infrastructure in human history.”The company has struggled with updating its manufacturing – a key part of improving the ability of processors – and is now bringing a technology called 10 nanometer to server chips. The new versions perform, on average, 46% better than their predecessors, Intel said Tuesday.Intel is trying to respond to a renewed challenge from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a company it had banished to less than 1% share in the lucrative server processor market. Intel plans to be “super aggressive” in competing, according to Navin Shenoy, who heads the Santa Clara, California-based company’s data center business.Intel chips using the 10-nanometer process were initially scheduled to debut in 2017. Difficulties in making that technology work economically caused multiple push backs. That holdup allowed AMD to field processors, made by contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., that it touts as more advanced than Intel’s products.The manufacturing delays were among the issues that plagued the once-dominant chipmaker, sending its stock down almost 17% last year and leading to the appointment in February of Pat Gelsinger as chief executive officer. Gelsinger, a former longtime Intel executive who left in 2009, last month announced a new strategy to revive the company’s technological prowess.Shenoy said that regardless of the competitive dynamics, Intel’s new flagship is being rolled out at a time of unprecedented demand for computer and networking infrastructure. The pandemic helped accelerate what the technology industry is calling the digitization of the economy.“We believe we’re headed for the biggest build-out of technology infrastructure in human history,” he said in an interview. “We’re seeing that in real time.”Shenoy said the changes in the economy are profound, and not just confined to the effects of the pandemic. For example, online conference calls have replaced air travel, hotel use and the need for rental cars, he said. The use of computing over the internet in the cloud and the building of fifth generation, or 5G, cellular networks will change multiple industries and spur demand.The new Intel chips will have as many as 40 computing cores built into one piece of silicon. They’ll also be able to access much more memory, a bottleneck for server performance, the company said.Shenoy said Intel’s unique strength is its ability to offer a range of chips – memory and artificial intelligence software accelerators – that customers need as much as bumps in processor speed.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-brings-delayed-tech-server-161932958.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-04-06	2021-04-06 13:59:56	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Why Shortages of a $1 Chip Sparked Crisis in Global Economy	(Bloomberg) -- To understand why the $450 billion semiconductor industry has lurched into crisis, a helpful place to start is a one-dollar part called a display driver.Hundreds of different kinds of chips make up the global silicon industry, with the flashiest ones from Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp. going for $100 apiece to more than $1,000. Those run powerful computers or the shiny smartphone in your pocket. A display driver chip is mundane by contrast: Its sole purpose is to convey basic instructions for illuminating the screen on your phone, monitor or navigation system.The trouble for the chip industry -- and increasingly companies beyond tech, like automakers -- is that there aren’t enough display drivers to go around. Firms that make them can’t keep up with surging demand so prices are spiking. That’s contributing to short supplies and increasing costs for liquid crystal display panels, essential components for making televisions and laptops, as well as cars, airplanes and high-end refrigerators.“It’s not like you can just make do. If you have everything else, but you don’t have a display driver, then you can’t build your product,” says Stacy Rasgon, who covers the semiconductor industry for Sanford C. Bernstein.Now the crunch in a handful of such seemingly insignificant parts -- power management chips are also in short supply, for example -- is cascading through the global economy. Automakers like Ford Motor Co., Nissan Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG have already scaled back production, leading to estimates for more than $60 billion in lost revenue for the industry this year.The situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. A rare winter storm in Texas knocked out swaths of U.S. production. A fire at a key Japan factory will shut the facility for a month. Samsung Electronics Co. warned of a “serious imbalance” in the industry, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said it can’t keep up with demand despite running factories at more than 100% of capacity.“I have never seen anything like this in the past 20 years since our company’s founding,” said Jordan Wu, co-founder and chief executive officer of Himax Technologies Co., a leading supplier of display drivers. “Every application is short of chips.”The chip crunch was born out of an understandable miscalculation as the coronavirus pandemic hit last year. When Covid-19 began spreading from China to the rest of the world, many companies anticipated people would cut back as times got tough.“I slashed all my projections. I was using the financial crisis as the model,” says Rasgon. “But demand was just really resilient.”People stuck at home started buying technology -- and then kept buying. They purchased better computers and bigger displays so they could work remotely. They got their kids new laptops for distance learning. They scooped up 4K televisions, game consoles, milk frothers, air fryers and immersion blenders to make life under quarantine more palatable. The pandemic turned into an extended Black Friday onlinepalooza.Automakers were blindsided. They shut factories during the lockdown while demand crashed because no one could get to showrooms. They told suppliers to stop shipping components, including the chips that are increasingly essential for cars.Then late last year, demand began to pick up. People wanted to get out and they didn’t want to use public transportation. Automakers reopened factories and went hat in hand to chipmakers like TSMC and Samsung. Their response? Back of the line. They couldn’t make chips fast enough for their still-loyal customers.Himax’s Jordan Wu is in the middle of the tech industry’s tempest. On a recent March morning, the bespectacled 61-year-old agreed to meet at his Taipei office to discuss the shortages and why they are so challenging to resolve. He was eager enough to talk that interview was scheduled for the same morning Bloomberg News requested it, with two of his staff joining in person and another two dialing in by phone. He wore a mask throughout the interview, speaking carefully and articulately.Wu founded Himax in 2001 with his brother Biing-seng, now the company’s chairman. They started out making driver ICs (for integrated circuits), as they’re known in the industry, for notebook computers and monitors. They went public in 2006 and grew with the computer industry, expanding into smartphones, tablets and touch screens. Their chips are now used in scores of products, from phones and televisions to automobiles.Wu explained that he can’t make more display drivers by pushing his workforce harder. Himax designs display drivers and then has them manufactured at a foundry like TSMC or United Microelectronics Corp. His chips are made on what’s artfully called “mature node” technology, equipment at least a couple generations behind the cutting-edge processes. These machines etch lines in silicon at a width of 16 nanometers or more, compared with 5 nanometers for high-end chips.​​The bottleneck is that these mature chip-making lines are running flat out. Wu says the pandemic drove such strong demand that manufacturing partners can’t make enough display drivers for all the panels that go into computers, televisions and game consoles -- plus all the new products that companies are putting screens into, like refrigerators, smart thermometers and car-entertainment systems.There’s been a particular squeeze in driver ICs for automotive systems because they’re usually made on 8-inch silicon wafers, rather than more advanced 12-inch wafers. Sumco Corp., one of the leading wafer manufacturers, reported production capacity for 8-inch equipment lines was about 5,000 wafers a month in 2020 -- less than it was in 2017.No one is building more mature-node manufacturing lines because it doesn’t make economic sense. The existing lines are fully depreciated and fine-tuned for almost perfect yields, meaning basic display drivers can be made for less than a dollar and more advanced versions for not much more. Buying new equipment and starting off at lower yields would mean much higher expenses.“Building new capacity is too expensive,” Wu says. Peers like Novatek Microelectronics Corp., also based in Taiwan, have the same constraints.That shortfall is showing up in a spike in LCD prices. A 50-inch LCD panel for televisions doubled in price between January 2020 and this March. Bloomberg Intelligence’s Matthew Kanterman projects that LCD prices will keep rising at least until the third quarter. There is a “a dire shortage” of display driver chips, he said.Aggravating the situation is a lack of glass. Major glass makers reported accidents at their production sites, including a blackout at a Nippon Electric Glass Co.’s factory in December and an explosion at AGC Fine Techno Korea’s factory in January. Production will likely remain constrained at least through summer this year, display consultancy DSCC Co-founder Yoshio Tamura said.On April 1, I-O Data Device Inc., a major Japanese computer peripherals maker, raised the price of their 26 LCD monitors by 5,000 yen on average, the biggest increase since they began selling the monitors two decades ago. A spokeswoman said the company can’t make any profit without the increases due to rising costs for components.All of this has been a boon for business. Himax’s sales are surging and its stock price has tripled since November. The U.S.-traded shares gained 1.6% in New York Tuesday morning. Novatek’s shares closed up 5.6% in Taiwan to a record high, pushing its increase for the year to more than 60%.But Wu isn’t celebrating. His whole business is built around giving customers what they want, so his inability to meet their requests at such a critical time is frustrating. He doesn’t expect the crunch, especially for automotive components, to end any time soon.“We have not reached a position where we can see the light at the end of tunnel yet,” Wu said.(Updates with Himax shares in the third to last paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-shortages-1-chip-sparked-220000647.html?.tsrc=rss

TSM previously announced a $28 billion commitment to tackle the global semiconductor crisis, including a $12 billion plant in Arizona. TSM suppliers’ shares, including Screen Holdings Co, Tokyo Electron Ltd (OTC: TOELF) (OTC: TOELY), and ASM International NV (OTC: ASMIY) (OTC: ASMXF), ASML Holding NV jumped on the announcement partly triggered by Micron Technology, Inc’s (NASDAQ: MU) bullish prediction. TSM held cash and cash equivalent of $28 billion as of December 31, 2020, fueling concerns over its capability to pull off the huge outlay amid the cutthroat competition. TSMC acknowledged a supply crisis despite the over 100% utilization rate by its fabs over the last year. The company has multiple factories under construction. It will suspend wafer price reductions for a year from 2022 beginning. Automakers have estimated a revenue hit of over $60 billion due to the global chip crisis. Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) committed a $20 billion investment in two new Arizona factories in March. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTC: SSNLF) is spending over $100 billion over the next ten years for a semiconductor business boost.

2021-04-01	2021-04-01 09:22:27	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Congress Weighs Countering China on Chips, But GOP Wary of Cost	(Bloomberg) -- Republicans in Congress say they’re willing to work with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to counter China’s economic clout and address a global shortage of semiconductors, but the price tag of a Democratic-led proposal may drive away GOP support.Schumer and Republicans have been discussing proposals to fund semiconductor research and development, as well as science and technology to compete with the government subsidies that Beijing offers its companies. Yet Republicans have been wary that the final proposal could end up costing a lot more than anticipated.President Joe Biden included the China-related proposals in a sweeping $2.25 trillion infrastructure plan he unveiled in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, even though the bigger package has been broadly rejected by Republicans.“American Jobs Plan is the biggest increase in our federal non-defense research and development spending on record,” Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh. “It’s going to boost America’s innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs, markets like battery technology, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy, competition with China in particular.”Biden’s announcement could complicate efforts to build Republican support because it feeds into concerns that the bill will be a Democratic domestic wish list disguised as competition with China, one congressional aide said.Schumer still plans to wrap several China-related bills into one standalone package that would go through a bipartisan committee debate and amendment process starting later this month, an aide to the New York Democrat said. This includes a $50 billion investment in semiconductor manufacturing and research, as well as $50 billion for the National Science Foundation to create a technology directorate.If the congressional debate gets bogged down in committee, however, Democrats may decide to add the bill into the broader infrastructure bill.Both Republicans and Democrats say the U.S. must counteract China’s explicit plans to challenge U.S. economic and technological might, a priority made increasingly urgent by a global shortage of chips that has idled U.S. automotive plants and disrupted the production of other consumer electronics. On Wednesday, the Ford Motor Co. cited the chip shortage when it said it had to idle production of its popular F-150 truck for two weeks, starting April 5.But Senator Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, and others in his party have made clear to Schumer that adding more spending or additional proposals to the China bill is a potential obstacle to Republican support and Schumer has acknowledged the challenge, people familiar with the discussions said. The overall price tag currently stands at $100 billion, spent over five years.GOP FrustrationBehind the scenes, some Republicans have been frustrated that they haven’t been able to get their ideas into the legislation, according to a person familiar with the matter. At the same time, the White House has begun reaching out to individual GOP senators amenable to working on bipartisan initiatives to find out what it would take to get a package over the finish line, the person said.In the end, Republicans may be hard-pressed to vote against anything that hits back at China. Yet while some Democrats seem to bank on their GOP colleagues facing such a dilemma, Republicans are holding out for the final language to voice their support.“We’ll see the specifics of what’s in it,” said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. “I try to avoid making commitments on legislation until I actually see what it says.”The bill will largely focus on science and technology funding and also appropriate money for semiconductor research and development, though many senators have advanced other proposals that could also make it into the package.More than half a dozen committees are writing their portions of the legislation and the plan is to introduce the package next month.Biden is supportive of that spending, and his White House has been engaged with lawmakers and foreign governments on the shortfall. The White House has also held discussions on the China-related provisions with several members of the House and Senate, including Young, an administration official pointed out.The official said there may be some areas where Congress is able to move more quickly because lawmakers have already teed up certain pieces of legislation and the White House would encourage those efforts.‘Own the Future’Investing in American innovation -- in an effort to compete with China -- is also in line with Biden’s broader infrastructure proposal.“The future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. And so what I’m going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2%,” he said last week during his first formal press conference since taking office.“So I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don’t criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That’s not going to happen on my watch because the United States are going to continue to grow and expand.”Semiconductor companies reeling from the global shortage expect funding for research and development grants that were authorized in the last defense spending bill. Biden has said he supports the roughly $30 billion for chips and his White House has been engaged with lawmakers and foreign governments on the shortfall. Senior Biden administration officials have been pleading with the Taiwanese government to allocate some of the capacity to supply U.S. automakers that had to idle production at multiple plants in North America.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s leading manufacturer of advanced semiconductors, announced Thursday that it plans to spend $100 billion over the next three years to expand its chip fabrication capacity, a staggering financial commitment to address booming demand for new technologies.The chips industry has also lobbied for refundable tax credits, but those won’t be included in the Schumer package because of a rule that requires revenue-related provisions to originate in the House, people familiar with the discussions said.Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who has filed a number of bills related to China in recent years, said many of the proposals that will be included have bipartisan support and that the legislation could receive overwhelming approval. “There’s a lot of really good ideas out there that I think could be added to a comprehensive piece of law that I think would enjoy, if not unanimity, certainly 90-something votes,” Rubio said.Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, said during a committee meeting last week that he was concerned about Chinese political influence in the U.S. and that any legislation would have to address Chinese efforts to steal intellectual property from universities and other research institutions.“If we are going to invest more in R&D in the United States, we have to make sure we are protecting the results,” he said. “If we don’t have anything strong and actionable on political influence, we’re missing a big part of the problem.”(Adds TSMC plans to spend $100 billion to expand capacity in 21st pragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/congress-weighs-countering-china-chips-001125152.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-04-01	2021-04-01 08:34:55	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC to Spend $100 Billion Over Three Years to Grow Capacity	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to spend $100 billion over the next three years to expand its chip fabrication capacity, a staggering financial commitment to address booming demand for new technologies.TSMC, the world’s leading manufacturer of advanced semiconductors, already planned a record capital expenditure of as much as $28 billion this year, but recent trends and developments have pushed for even more capacity. Now at the center of a global chip supply crunch, Taiwan’s biggest company has pledged to work with customers across industries to overcome a deluge of demand.Read more: See How a Chip Shortage Snarled Everything From Phones to Cars“TSMC expects to invest USD$100b over the next three years to increase capacity to support the manufacturing and R&D of advanced semiconductor technologies,” the company said in a statement responding to local media reports. “TSMC is working closely with our customers to address their needs in a sustainable manner.”TSMC suppliers surged on the news, buoyed in part also by Micron Technology Inc.’s bullish forecast. Screen Holdings Co. climbed 6%, Tokyo Electron Ltd. rose 4.7% and ASM International NV jumped as much as 5.4% while ASML Holding NV was as much as 3.2% higher on Thursday. TSMC’s own share price was up 2.6% on the day.It’s unclear how TSMC -- with $28 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet at the end of December -- intends to finance that record outlay, which underscores the enormous capital required to stay at the forefront of the industry. Relied on by everyone from Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. to Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., TSMC is the world’s go-to semiconductor foundry, or producer of chips designed by others. The silicon it churns out goes into practically every modern piece of electronics, from smartphones and smart fridges to connected cars.In a letter to customers obtained by Bloomberg News, TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei wrote that the company’s fabs have been “running at over 100% utilization over the past 12 months,” but demand still outpaced supply. Thousands of new employees are being hired and multiple new factories are under construction, he added, and TSMC will suspend wafer price reductions for a year from the start of 2022.Carmakers have been hit particularly hard by the chip shortages, with estimates for lost revenue of more than $60 billion this year. Ford Motor Co. just said it would temporarily suspend production at two plants that make its best-selling F-150 pickup. F-Series trucks are Ford’s biggest moneymakers and any lost production has a direct impact on the bottom line.Read more: Samsung Warns of Severe Chip Crunch While Delaying Key PhoneU.S. rival Intel Corp. in March announced plans to directly compete with TSMC for the business of manufacturing chips for other companies, with a $20 billion investment in two new factories in Arizona. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. is also spending in excess of $100 billion over a decade to expand its semiconductor business.(Updates with share reaction in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-spend-100-billion-over-020928049.html?.tsrc=rss

Chairman Mark Liu.Speaking to reporters at an industry event in Hsinchu in his role as chairman of the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association, Liu said uncertainty around the U.S.-China relationship led to a supply chain shift and pushed some companies to double up on orders to secure inventory. Others rushed to fill the market gap left by Huawei Technologies Co. after sanctions crippled its consumer business.“Uncertainties led to double booking, but actual capacity is larger than demand,” Liu said. How quickly those concerns are resolved “really depends on future U.S.-China negotiations.”The coronavirus outbreak would have had the same negative impact on production no matter where operations are located, the executive said. TSMC is the world’s leading manufacturer of advanced semiconductors, relied on by everyone from Apple Inc. to Xiaomi Corp. Liu said each individual country developing its own domestic semiconductor industry would lead to a lot of “non-profitable” capacity.Read more: The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeThe U.S. and China have both indicated a desire to grow chip production within their own borders, in part to make themselves less reliant on foreign partners. President Xi Jinping made reducing China’s dependence on the west part of the country’s latest five-year policy plan, while successive White House administrations have signaled concern about China’s potential to dominate sensitive cutting-edge technologies.In the U.S., Intel Corp. recently announced a $20 billion plan to build two new silicon fabrication facilities in Arizona, renewing previously failed efforts to compete with TSMC for business as the manufacturer of chips for others.Taiwan’s biggest company finds itself at the center of a global crisis of supply as its production capacity has been consumed first by a pandemic-driven surge in demand for personal electronics and more recently by a faster-than-expected recovery in automotive sales.(Updates with quote from Liu in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-china-tensions-worsened-chip-090234202.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-03-28	2021-03-28 04:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Here’s How the World’s Chip Shortage Is Playing Out for Stocks	(Bloomberg) -- A global semiconductor shortage has upended the supply of everyday devices from smartphones to gaming consoles to tech-dependent cars. With companies warning the issue may last into the second half, the fallout threatens to weigh on share prices for months to come.Since news broke in November that Apple Inc. faced a shortage of chips for its latest iPhone, warnings about the impact have been coming thick and fast. Truckmaker Volvo Group and electric-vehicle company Nio Inc. last week joined a long list of auto producers that have idled assembly lines.The lack of chips has been caused by booming demand for tech gear, in large part because of the pandemic, and winter weather in Texas and a fire in Japan have added to the problem. It’s been a boon for companies such as Applied Materials Inc. and Lam Research Corp. that produce the equipment semiconductor makers need to boost output.Here’s a look at the companies with the most at stake as the global chip shortage rages on, and how their stocks have been affected:AutomakersAuto stocks have come roaring back from their pandemic lows. Now both the chip shortage and concern over a resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic have pulled a Bloomberg index of global manufacturers down 14% from its Jan. 25 record high.Volvo Group slumped 7% Tuesday after saying it will have to suspend production due to the lack of semiconductors, while China’s Nio slid 4.8% Friday when it said it will stop output at a factory in Anhui province.A fire March 19 at a Japanese factory operated by Renesas Electronics Corp., one of the biggest makers of automotive chips, hit the industry hard. It triggered a 6.7% drop in General Motors Corp. shares over three days last week. In Japan, shares of Toyota Motor Corp., which touched a six-year high March 18, slumped 6.1% in the subsequent four sessions.“The automotive sector has arguably experienced the greatest level of disruption, with more and more OEMs either slowing production or closing manufacturing plants on a temporary basis,” said Thomas Fitzgerald, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management Ltd., referring to original equipment manufacturers.China’s Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. slid 19% over three days last week after reporting disappointing earnings. Daiwa Securities cited the chip shortage in downgrading the stock and cutting estimates for this year and next. China is dealing with unrelated chip-supply issues of its own.READ, Chip Shortage May Put Market-Beating Rally at Risk: Taking StockSmartphones, Consumer ElectronicsBeyond the auto industry, it’s harder to tease out the stock market impact on companies that depend on semiconductors. Shares of Apple, for example, didn’t react in November to the impact of the shortage, and they’re up more than 5% since then. Smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. slumped 4.4% Thursday after warning that parts shortages could slow its growth for the next few quarters.One positive aspect of the chip shortage: With demand for consumer electronics as strong as it is, it gives companies the power to raise prices and pass on higher costs, said Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. “The share prices haven’t reacted particularly negatively to the news, and I think that’s because the important part is that you’re seeing a snapback in demand for these goods,” he said.Lenovo Group Ltd. said in August that its profit margins took a hit from the chip shortage, and in November it said it couldn’t fill all customer orders due to the lack of components. Still, demand for the company’s laptops is soaring because of purchases by people working at home, and the stock has doubled since August.Sony Corp. said last month it might be unable to fully sate demand for its new gaming console in 2021 because of production bottlenecks. The stock touched a 21-year high in February, though it’s dipped 8.2% since then.While Samsung Electronics Co.’s foundry business making chips for other companies benefits from the favorable supply-demand equation, the South Korean firm also has its own line of consumer products that are hurt. Samsung this month warned of problems, including the possible cancellation of the launch of its new Galaxy Note, one of its best-selling smartphone models.Makers of networking equipment also have been feeling the pinch. Analysts at Oddo BHF flagged a DigiTimes report that the lead times for deliveries of networking chips are extending to as long as 50 weeks, suggesting that the chip shortage has also reached the networking segment and will likely last into early next year.ChipmakersWhile automakers have struggled, the flip side of the semiconductor shortage is that the companies supplying those chips could see a boost to their business. Most semiconductor companies should report strong results for the first quarter and give good guidance for the second, said Janardan Menon, an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd.“This is all great news for the semiconductor vendor,” Liberum’s Menon said by phone. “This kind of tightness -- of capacity utilization, rising prices, very, very strong demand -- invariably means that their results are very, very strong.”However, Menon cautioned that share prices may not follow, given the market is now worried that the peak of the semiconductor cycle is approaching.European auto chip supplier Infineon Technologies AG is up 12% for the year while STMicroelectronics NV has gained just 5.6%. In the U.S., Texas Instruments Inc. is up 15%, while NXP Semiconductors NV and ON Semiconductor Corp. have done better, up 25% and 24% respectively, versus the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index’s 11% rise.There are also broader winners from the shortages in the semiconductor industry, with chip foundries such as leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. running at close to full capacity to try to keep up with the surge in demand.

2021-03-25	2021-03-25 21:00:05	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Biden Finds a Key Ally Wary of His Bid to Outpace China on Chips	(Bloomberg) -- South Korea has long relied on the U.S. for security and on China for trade, seeking to keep politics out of business to avoid picking sides.That geopolitical balancing act is becoming increasingly untenable as Washington and Beijing square off over technology.South Korea’s advanced semiconductor industry is witnessing soaring global demand as consumer electronics sell out during the pandemic, with exports by Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. leading what is shaping up to be the strongest quarter of economic growth since 2018.Yet with chips at the heart of the U.S.-China conflict, Seoul risks serious collateral damage if the superpower rivalry intensifies under presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping. Intel Corp.’s announcement that it’s committing to advanced chip fabrication in the U.S. dovetails with the Biden administration’s objectives of regaining the lead in technology, suggesting competition with China will only deepen.An extended standoff between Washington and Beijing poses a dilemma for American allies across Asia as Biden rallies them to take a unified stand against China, forcing governments to make a choice over how far they’re prepared to risk a backlash from the world’s second-biggest economy. South Korea avoided joining a U.S.-coordinated condemnation of China’s alleged human-rights abuses in Xinjiang, which provoked a furious reaction from Beijing.South Korea’s status as a world-leading chipmaker makes its predicament particularly acute, further straining its efforts to maintain good relations with both China, the destination for about a third of its exports, and the U.S., which provides security particularly to defend against North Korea’s nuclear threat.The “long-term partnership and alliance with the U.S. has always been Korea’s priority,” said Choi Ji-eun, spokeswoman for President Moon Jae-in’s Democratic Party, not least because South Korea wants to safeguard the global system of free trade that has allowed it to prosper as a top ten exporter.South Korea’s significance in the tussle between the world’s two biggest economies was made clear when U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited Seoul during their first overseas trip.But its actions in relation to semiconductors — the country’s biggest export by far — are more ambiguous, fueling speculation that South Korea could be the weak link in Washington’s attempts to deny Beijing access to advanced chips and equipment.“We don’t benefit from pursuing a hostile policy toward Beijing, neither in terms of security nor the economy,” said Kim Young-ho, a ruling Democratic Party lawmaker who sits on the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee. As a result, South Korea’s national interests are not fully in line with Washington’s China strategy, he said.Semiconductors have jumped up the political agenda as countries from China to Japan, the U.S. and in Europe all seek to secure the supply chain for chips that are vital to every aspect of digital life, from data centers to smartphones. That strategic imperative — what the industry calls a rush toward “techno-nationalism” — has been compounded by a pandemic-induced shortage of chips that is forecast to cost $61 billion in sales for automakers alone this year.While much of the focus has been on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to remedy the shortfall as the world’s largest contract chipmaker, Samsung is the only company able to compete at the cutting edge. And yet the South Korean giant appears far more keen than TSMC to maintain its foothold in China.Why the world is dangerously dependent on Taiwan for chipsSamsung is considering spending $17 billion building an advanced semiconductor fabrication plant, or fab, in Texas. At the same time, Samsung began operations last year of a second fab in the Chinese president’s hometown of Xian as part of a $15 billion investment. SK Hynix has meanwhile announced plans to acquire $9 billion-worth of Intel’s memory and storage business including its fab in Dalian, China.A senior trade official in Seoul, who asked not to be named discussing sensitive political matters, said that South Korea can ill afford to lose either market given its export-driven economy. The best scenario, according to the official, is that the U.S.-China conflict doesn’t deteriorate further.That may be wishful thinking after the first face-to-face contacts between China and the Biden administration descended into a slanging match. Responding to Blinken’s comments that he’d encountered “deep concern” about some of Beijing’s actions during his Asia tip, Politburo member Yang Jiechi played the economic card as he pointed out that Japan and South Korea are China’s No. 2 and No. 3 trade partners respectively.South Korea had a taste of what China’s economic wrath looks like when it was hit by unofficial retaliation for the decision made by a previous government to deploy the U.S. THAAD missile-defense system in 2017. Seoul’s position is further complicated by its reliance on China to help mediate with the regime in North Korea — South Korea needs Beijing’s support if it wants to achieve its chief foreign policy aim of denuclearization by Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un’s regime called for stronger ties with China and also fired its first ballistic missile since Biden took office.Confrontation with China would simply push it closer to North Korea, according to lawmaker Kim Young-ho. “I think Washington understands that and shares our concerns,” he said.Rocky relations with Tokyo due to the legacy of Japan’s colonial rule of the Korean peninsula during World War II are another layer of geopolitical complexity that has spilled into the chip arena. In 2019, Japan imposed export curbs on chemicals used in smartphones and semiconductors claiming that its “trust” in South Korea had been damaged.With so many considerations, South Korea has yet to provide a definitive answer to Washington’s unofficial offer to join a coalition with the U.S. and Japan to deal with North Korea and China. Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong has said that South Korea is seeking an early summit with the U.S. as it aims for a “comprehensive” development of bilateral relations. The key question is how the government will respond to the Biden administration on the issue of tech transfers to China, said Mathieu Duchatel, head of the Asia program at the Institut Montaigne in Paris, who researches the geopolitical dimension of semiconductors.Biden’s emerging approach appears to be to build small coalitions depending on the technology involved to update export controls and deny access to Beijing, he said. For South Korea, “especially under the Moon administration and its North [Korea] policy, it’s clear that they won’t be as confrontational on tech.”South Korea’s best card may be that, as much as it needs to stay in the good graces of both the U.S. and China, they in turn need the irreplaceable skills of its chip industry. That reliance is growing: Samsung makes more than a third of the world’s memory chips and an increasing portion of the advanced logic that’s at the heart of the world’s phones and computers. When you add in Samsung’s local rival SK Hynix, the need for Korean chips only grows.Moon has pushed to diversify export markets to Southeast Asia and India after the THAAD dispute. But geography matters in trade, and South Korea’s overall exports to China were still more than double those to the U.S. in 2019. Chip sales were worth more than twice the No. 2 item, cars, with China the main destination.That might not last if it’s forced to take sides. “Korea may have to compromise some of its market share in China if Washington pushes Seoul to be part of an economic alliance among democratic countries,” said Wi Sung-rak, a former South Korean ambassador to Russia who previously served as director of the Foreign Ministry’s North American Affairs Bureau.For now, according to a separate government official, the Moon administration has to continue to support the global chip supply chain. Like the U.S. and China, however, it’s also taking steps to strengthen its domestic semiconductor capacity, spending a planned 2.1 trillion won ($1.9 billion) last year to boost local material, parts and equipment suppliers focused on chips and displays.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-chip-industry-caught-210005432.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-03-25	2021-03-25 16:46:50	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel's 'Strategic Faux Pas' Could Be AMD's Gain Says Northland Capital Analyst	Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) could benefit from Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ: INTC) “strategic faux pas” to try to reenter the foundry business, according to Northland Capital Markets. The Advanced Micro Devices Analyst: Gus Richard upgraded the rating for Advanced Micro Devices from Market Perform to Outperform, while raising the price target to $96. The Advanced Micro Devices Thesis: Taiwan Semiconductor is unlikely to relinquish its manufacturing lead to Intel “any time soon,” Richard said in the upgrade note. “We believe that Intel's commitment to re-entry into the foundry market and maintain leading-edge manufacturing capacity makes it a low priority at TSMC,” the analyst wrote. On the other hand, Advanced Micro Devices is a preferred customer for Taiwan Semiconductor as all its leading-edge volume is produced at Taiwan Semiconductor, he noted. “INTC expansion into the foundry market will increase AMD as a priority for TSMC and INTC will be persona non grata,” Richard said. “For this reason, we expect AMD's market share momentum to continue,” he added. AMD Price Action: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices are up 0.039% to $76.51 at the time of publication Thursday.

2021-03-24	2021-03-24 13:40:24	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel CEO Charts Comeback on Foundry Model TSMC Mastered	(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. unveiled a grand plan Tuesday to restore its past chipmaking glory. To succeed, new Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger must embrace a strategy the old Intel never dreamed of: playing nice with rivals.“Intel is back. The old Intel is the new Intel,” he said. “We’re going to be leaders in the market and we’re going to satisfy the new foundry customers, because the world needs more semiconductors and we’re going to step into that gap in a powerful and meaningful way.”Intel shares gained 3.5% Wednesday after the plan was announced. Analysts were largely positive on the company’s ambitions to create a new foundry business, though they cautioned Intel will have to prove itself following unsuccessful past attempts to break into the area. Key parts of the strategy are new territory for a company that’s used to doing everything its own way. Intel has almost always designed and produced its semiconductors in-house. Now, Gelsinger is starting a foundry business that will manufacture chips for other companies. And he also plans to use rivals’ factories to outsource production of more Intel components.This will create complex new relationships. For instance, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. runs the world’s leading chip foundry business. Intel is now encroaching on TSMC’s turf, while also expecting this rival to make some of Intel’s best chips.“TSMC will do as much for Intel as they feel they have to,” said Matt Ramsay, an analyst at Cowen & Co.Read more: Intel’s $20 Billion Foundry Plan Hits Shares of TSMC, SamsungBefore other chip companies commit to using Intel’s factories, it has to fix its own manufacturing problems, the analyst added. Intel’s latest 7-nanometer production process has been delayed and that followed several missed deadlines for the previous 10-nanometer standard. Gelsinger said on Tuesday these issues have been fixed, but analysts are dubious.“We simply don’t understand why customers would strongly support an Intel foundry given that Intel is so far behind on process technology, and doesn’t yet possess the standard libraries needed to compete with TSMC,” said Chris Caso, an analyst at Raymond James.Charles Shum, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said big technology companies, such as Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., will hesitate to shift orders to Intel because they compete with the company in designing chips.TSMC Can Fight Off Intel Challenge in Chip Manufacturing: ReactGelsinger began his career at Intel in the 1970s and worked his way up the ranks to run some of its biggest units. He left in 2009 when Intel was approaching its zenith using a strategy he helped put in place. Intel introduced new products and new manufacturing technology at a blistering cadence that competitors couldn’t match, and PC and server customers built their product cycles around it.While he mentioned a return to that “tick-tock” discipline on Tuesday, Gelsinger will have to lean on the recent experience he gained as head of software maker VMware Inc. to navigate a more complex world for Intel.During a presentation with analysts on Tuesday, Gelsinger said the way semiconductors are designed and manufactured has changed. Parts of chips can now be made in different places using different technologies, then combined in packages. This helps designers pick and choose what fits their needs best -- and it makes the old Intel model of keeping it all under one roof less relevant.Intel showed off the logos of Qualcomm and other companies that it said are supporting its foundry push. With rising geopolitical and trade tensions between China and the U.S., customers want suppliers with facilities outside of Taiwan, Intel said.Read more: The World Is Dangerously Dependent on Taiwan for SemiconductorsGelsinger is shaking it up further by doing something his predecessors would have deemed sacrilege. Intel used to jealously guard its X86 processor technology, the dominant instruction set for computer microprocessors. Now this will be available as a design if Intel foundry customers want to use it. And they can combine that with rival approaches such as those offered by Arm Ltd. and an open-source standard called RISC-V, he said.Intel has tried and failed as a foundry before. This effort is different because customers will get access to Intel’s best manufacturing techology, Gelsinger said. And there are at least two new factories being built for the effort.“Our past attempts were somewhat half-hearted,” Gelsinger said. “Customers will get the best we’ve got to offer.”New Intel CEO May Drive Improved EPS, Valuation: Company OutlookTo make his goals clear internally, Gelsinger has set up a separate division called Intel Foundry Services that will report its own financial performance and therefore have to align itself with customers’ interests to guarantee it meets targets.“If he’s really dedicated to the benefits he’s touting today, then this will put Intel on a much more competitive footing,” Loop Capital Markets analyst Cody Acree said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “You are going to get this honeymoon period that Mr. Gelsinger is in today where people are looking for the changes, looking for optimism, anything to hang onto with Intel. That’s the right thing to do. But it’s also pretty shortlived.”(Updates with shares in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-ceo-charts-comeback-foundry-030657933.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-24	2021-03-24 00:48:09	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Spending Billions to Revive Manufacturing, Chase TSMC	(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. unveiled an ambitious bid to regain its manufacturing lead by spending billions of dollars on new factories and creating a foundry business that will make chips for other companies. The stock jumped about 5%.The plan, launched Tuesday by new Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, is an aggressive move that puts Intel into direct competition with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s most-advanced chipmaker.Gelsinger will spend an initial $20 billion on two new plants in Arizona to support Intel’s attempt to break into the foundry business. Intel plans even more factories in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, with the CEO pledging that the majority of the company’s chips will be manufactured in-house.Read more: Intel CEO Charts Comeback on Foundry Model TSMC MasteredIntel dominated the $400 billion industry for decades by making the best designs in its own cutting-edge factories. That strategy crumbled in recent years as the company missed deadlines for new production technology, while most other chipmakers tapped foundry specialists to make their designs.Intel’s factories now trail TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co., which make chips for Intel competitors, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and big Intel customers including Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.The plan will give Intel “a unique ability to have leadership products, with the leadership supply chain and leadership cost structure across every portion of our business,” said Gelsinger, who re-joined the company earlier this year. “We are off to the races, we’re going to be at parity and then to move to sustained leadership, over time.”What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysIntel’s new CEO’s plan to reinvigorate chip manufacturing -- expanding it as a service to cloud customers and its own rivals -- will depend on his execution prowess. Surmounting the challenges could push the chip giant’s profit growth beyond the low-single-digits after 2021, with a possible boost to its low-teens P/E, though margins may stay mixed.- Anand Srinivasan and Marina Girgis, analystsClick here for the research.Intel’s Chip Moonshot Is About Supremacy, Not Profit: Tim CulpanGelsinger’s predecessor considered abandoning Intel’s in-house manufacturing entirely and some investors wanted the company to cut costs by outsourcing production. The new plan scraps those approaches and represents an expensive, multiyear re-commitment to Intel’s manufacturing heritage.During a presentation on Tuesday, Intel forecast capital expenditure of as much as $20 billion in 2021, up from $14 billion last year. The company also projected revenue this year that missed Wall Street estimates.The company’s problems came to a head last year with a delay in its latest 7-nanometer production process. That followed similar missed deadlines for the previous 10-nanometer standard.Read more: Intel ‘Stunning Failure’ Heralds End of Era for U.S. Chip SectorOn Tuesday, Intel said the latest manufacturing technique is now progressing well, helped by a simplified process. “Even though the stumble on 10 and seven was embarrassing for a company like ours, it’s fixed,” Gelsinger said in an interview. “We understand what the problem is.”Intel will use TSMC chip foundries for some of its needs, including parts of its most important products, Gelsinger also said. While that’s a step beyond what it currently does, the company will still produce the majority of its products internally.The world’s largest chipmaker is creating a new unit, called Intel Foundry Services, that aims to “become a major provider of U.S. and Europe-based foundry capacity to serve the incredible global demand for semiconductor manufacturing.”To support this effort, Intel will begin a “significant” expansion of its manufacturing capacity, beginning with two new plants adjacent to its site in Chandler, Arizona. TSMC is also considering building a plant in the area. Intel will announce further capacity expansions in the U.S., Europe and other global locations later this year. The Santa Clara, California-based company currently has factories in Ireland, Israel and China.TSMC and Samsung slipped after the news, while shares of semiconductor equipment makers rallied on expectations of increased spending by Intel. Nikon Corp. surged as much as 13%, Lasertec Corp. rose 7.6% and Tokyo Electron saw a 4.9% increase in Tokyo on Wednesday morning.Gelsinger’s plan is a rallying cry for those who want Intel -- and the U.S. -- to reassert technology leadership. China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars to develop its own semiconductor industry and there are renewed calls for the U.S. government to support domestic production.Read more: The World Is Dangerously Dependent on Taiwan for SemiconductorsThere’s considerable ground to make up for Intel and the U.S., though. Some analysts doubt the company can catch TSMC soon, or ever. Doing so will require a heavy investment. TSMC will spend as much as $28 billion in 2021. That’s twice what Intel spent last year.“We are excited to be partnering with the state of Arizona and the Biden administration on incentives that spur this type of domestic investment,” Gelsinger said in a statement. He later noted that Intel will pursue its plan with or without government incentives.Intel tried and failed to get into the foundry industry before. That effort failed because its manufacturing process was too tied to its own chip designs, which are primarily high-performance computer microprocessors. That made Intel factories ill-suited to other types of chips, particularly smartphone components that need to be more energy efficient.“Our past attempts were somewhat half-hearted,” Gelsinger said. The new foundry unit will report directly to the CEO as a standalone business with its own profit-and-loss requirements, he added.Gelsinger also addressed the potential for conflicts between Intel’s own chip efforts and this new business. Under the plan, Intel’s factories will potentially provide production and license technology to companies that compete with its own products.Intel is committing “serious” production capacity and leading chip technologies to IFS, the CEO said. “Customers will get the best we’ve got to offer” he added. “We’re going about this in a much more aggressive holistic fashion.”Gelsinger is making other radical changes. IFS will make chips for other companies, based on Intel’s X86 technology. Previously, only AMD was able to create chips using this dominant computing standard. Intel will also embrace rival standards from Arm Ltd. and an open-source alternative called RISC-V.Read more: Silicon Valley’s Next Revolution Is Open Source SemiconductorsChip manufacturing is unique in that the process of making the tiny components has a large influence on the characteristics and performance of the end product. The best production technology shrinks the transistors on chips so they can store more information, crunch data more quickly, use less power or be cheaper.Intel revenue rose 8% to a record $77.9 billion in 2020 as the company filled orders for chips in computers needed to work and study from home during the pandemic. This year, analysts predict sales will fall 5%, the first decline since 2015.Read more: The World Is Short of Computer Chips.

2021-03-19	2021-03-19 17:31:41	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	7 Tech Stocks Still Quenching Our Thirst for Smartphones	To say that consumers have adopted the smartphone would be an understatement: in 2020 about 1.38 billion smartphones were sold worldwide. In the U.S. alone there are more than 260 million smartphone users. That figure indicates that penetration rates have eclipsed 80% in the U.S. And there is plenty of money being made by tech stocks when counted as revenue from smartphone sales. In fact, annual sales now exceed $70 billion. Those figures leave investors extremely curious about the potential of stocks within the sector. Indeed, investors can view the sector from several angles. This article will primarily look at the companies behind the physical product consumers receive, i.e., the actual smartphone itself. 7 Retail Stocks That Are Far Too Close to Failing What follows is a list of seven strong companies to consider investing in as our collective demand for smartphones shows few signs of waning. They are:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (NYSE:TSM) Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Ericsson (NYSE:ERIC) Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) MagnaChip Semiconductor (NYSE:MX) Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Tech Stocks: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. is a company any investor interested in semiconductors and smartphones should know about. The company is integral to both of those industries. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that TSMC is a company everyone should know about. That’s because it is the world’s leading semiconductor foundry. A foundry is simply a manufacturer which supplies semiconductors to companies that outsource their designed chips. And semiconductors are in everything. TSMC manufactured 10,761 products for 499 customers in 2019. But I digress. TSMC manufactures 5nm chips which are becoming increasingly important. Revenues for 5 nm chips have taken off in the past two quarters. TSMC manufactures the Apple A14 Bionic. That chip is used in the iPhone 12 and the iPad Air 2020. And TSMC has recently become even more important as there is an ongoing semiconductor shortage. As a result, TSMC is in an extremely strong position. TSMC’s monthly revenues are rising quickly. In January the company saw revenue rise 22.2% year-over-year. And in February revenue increased by 14.1% YoY. As far as plays on smartphones go, TSM stock is a very smart bet. Apple (AAPL) Source: Hadrian / Shutterstock.com It’s only right to write about Apple when discussing demand for smartphones. According to livemint.com, Apple makes 5 out of the 10 most sold phones of 2020. Although Apple is clearly a strong company, it is in a bit of a strange place. Apple had a huge first quarter. Back in late January the company posted record quarterly earnings. Revenues hit an all-time high of $111.4 billion and earnings were $1.68 per share representing a 35% increase. But AAPL stock is down nevertheless. In fact, Apple shares have lost about 16% of their value since late January. There is a general sentiment that perhaps Apple had run out of steam. After all, how can it beat its incredible Q1 results? Further, Apple didn’t provide clear revenue guidance for the coming quarter citing the pandemic as the reason. The situation represents an obvious buy-the-dip opportunity. 7 Retail Stocks That Are Far Too Close to Failing As an investor I’d ask myself this question: is Apple likely to continue to grow, or not? I side with more bullish opinions about Apple as a current buy-the-dip target. Among those voices are Jefferies analyst Kyle McNealy, who stated “We think the Street still underappreciates Apple’s opportunity with 5G, in our view, there’s much more to come as we’re only in the initial innings of Apple’s 5G adoption cycle.” Ericsson (ERIC) Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Let’s switch gears from chips and smartphone manufacturers to another massive narrative in smartphones: 5G. Specifically, let’s look at the buildout of the 5G networks. That’s where Ericsson figures prominently in relation to the conversation around smartphone demand. Ericsson is currently engaged in a pitched battle with Huawei and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) to establish commercial agreements with 5G operators across the globe. Back in August of 2020, Ericsson announced it had secured its 100th 5G commercial agreement with unique service providers. At that time it also operated 56 live global networks. Huawei is leading the race to secure network contracts but it faces pressure from governments around the globe. Governments worry the Chinese company will use its 5G equipment to spy on other countries. The U.S. Department of Justice case against Huawei has cast light upon the Chinese company and global governments are clearly worried as well. As a result, Huawei is now banned from several countries. This opened the door for Ericsson and Nokia. Ericsson’s most recent count is 131 5G commercial contracts and 79 live networks. Nokia, on the other hand, has 146 commercial 5G deals and 55 live networks. Huawei is far and away the leader though. It has signed more than 1,000 corporate 5G contracts. All three of these companies sit within Gartner’s Magic Quadrant, which highlights leaders within specific industries. So why consider Ericsson over Huawei or Nokia? The answer to that question is simple: Ericsson is much better regarded on Wall Street and Huawei isn’t a publicly traded company. Tech Stocks: Micron Technology (MU) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Micron Technology is another semiconductor manufacturer on this list. The company’s solutions span multiple industries including 5G and Mobile. Micron, like most smartphone chip manufacturers, focuses on efficient chips which minimize power consumption while enabling high-speed data. It has a few interesting projects for mobile as an end market. Micron is addressing the high-end mobile market with its 176 layer NAND. 176 layer NAND features 2X more efficiency than its previous 96 layer NAND as well as doubled write performance. This means that Micron’s chips have utility in smartphones which require better specs to power their operation. 7 Retail Stocks That Are Far Too Close to Failing Q1 mobile revenue was up YoY for Micron. The company has transitioned away from Huawei to other mobile customers during the quarter. Micron’s Mobile Business Unit is its second largest behind Compute and Networking. Mobile accounts for roughly 25% of revenues. MagnaChip Semiconductor (MX) Source: apichon_tee/ShutterStock.com MagnaChip Semiconductors designs and manufactures chipsets applicable to many technologies. Within mobile, MagnaChip has both power and display solutions. MagnaChip’s OLED Display Driver Integrated Circuits (DDICs) allow mobile innovation. This technology produces high resolution pictures on mobile devices and allows for foldable, flexible, and even rollable screens. MagnaChip also provides multiple mobile power solutions for smartphones. MagnaChip reported Q4 revenues of $142.9 million, which represented a 15.9% YoY increase. OLED DDIC revenue amounted to $80.4 million of that $142.9 million during the quarter. The $80.4 million OLED DDICs was a new quarterly record, and an increase of 19.4% YoY. OLED DDIC displays provide 1440 X 3360 resolution and MagnaChip is entering full scale production after the encouraging results. The displays will be integrated into 5G phones. The company expects 5G phone shipments to grow from 220 million units in 2020 to 1.15 billion units in 2023 based on market research from Omdia. Qorvo (QRVO) Source: Shutterstock Qorvo is yet another semiconductor company which has seen a fair amount of success lately. The company has recorded EPS earnings beats in each of the past four quarters. That said, it isn’t an outright “buy” according to Wall Street. Instead, it maintains an “overweight” status based on the opinions of the analysts covering the stock. Qorvo saw both revenues and profits rise during the last three quarters of 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. Revenues increased by 20.44%, while net income increased by 54.57%. That indicates that Qorvo is operationally efficient. And increased sales translate to an even larger increase in net income. 7 Retail Stocks That Are Far Too Close to Failing Qorvo is a supplier to Apple. According to a recent Barron’s article, Qorvo may be more important than ever. Qorvo makes RF (radio frequency) chips that help phones connect to wireless networks and the internet. A Barclay’s analyst recently disregarded indications that the iPhone mini may see a 20% reduction in orders. The analyst issued a note countering that notion, and as a result Qorvo shares rose. Tech Stocks: Qualcomm (QCOM) Source: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.com Qualcomm is relying on its Snapdragon mobile platform to drive revenues in the mobile sector. It is marketing the platform to OEMs highlighting its utility in computer vision, camera features and machine intelligence. Qualcomm is particularly aiming at mobile gaming with its Snapdragon platform. The entire platform can be viewed here. Qualcomm is aiming at the intersection of AI, graphics, gaming and all of the leading smartphone features consumers are demanding out of the latest handsets. Qualcomm anticipates high single-digit growth in 5G handset shipments in 2021. It estimates that it will ship 450 million to 550 million units in fiscal year 2021. Qualcomm also saw a big jump from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021 on both a net income and EBITDA basis. Net income increased from $925 million to $2.455 billion during that period, while EBITDA more than doubled. Qualcomm is separated into three distinct business segments including QCT (CDMA technologies), QTL (technology licensing), and QSI (strategic initiatives). The QCT sector accounts for roughly 3X the revenues of the QTL sector while QSI is an outlay of capital for investment initiatives.

2021-03-18	2021-03-18 05:23:50	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Top China Chipmaker Gets State Funds for $2.4 Billion Plant	(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. will build a $2.35 billion plant with funding from the government of Shenzhen, the first major project to emerge from China’s masterplan to match the U.S. and become more self-reliant as global chip supply dwindles.SMIC on Thursday warned that shortages could worsen this year and next and wallop Chinese businesses if the country doesn’t ramp up domestic capacity now. The company has agreed to a joint venture with the southern municipality in which it will develop and operate a chipmaking plant that can produce silicon of 28 nanometers or above, it said in a stock exchange filing. The partners aim to draw third-party investment, begin production by 2022 and eventually produce 40,000 12-inch wafers a month. Its shares rose as much as 3% in Hong Kong.China wants to build a coterie of technology giants that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. While specifics of that endeavor won’t emerge for months, Premier Li Keqiang has pledged to boost spending and drive research into cutting-edge chips in the country’s latest five-year targets, laying out a technological blueprint to vie for global influence with the U.S.“The shortage in chip manufacturing capacity is very real and the situation could deteriorate in 2021 and 2022 if Chinese companies don’t speed up expansion,” SMIC Senior Vice President Zhang Xin told the SEMICON China conference in Shanghai.Beijing is moving swiftly to cut a dependence on the West for crucial components like chips, an issue that became more urgent after a global shortage of semiconductors worsened during the pandemic. Washington has also blacklisted major Chinese tech firms including SMIC, cutting it off from American technology while severely impairing its ability to procure the chipmaking gear it needs. It remains unclear whether the Biden administration might allow U.S. firms to resume selling to SMIC on a large scale, or ease up on pressuring allies in Europe and elsewhere to ringfence the Chinese company.Read more: How China’s Top Chipmaker Can Evade Trump’s Newest CrackdownTie-ups with the government may prove essential in achieving the country’s ambitions. Chinese chipmakers aim to progress past the more mature 28 nm nodes -- now used in industries from automaking to TVs -- but need billions of dollars and years of trial-and-error to get into more sophisticated semiconductors for gadgets like smartphones.Much of China’s hopes rest on making headway in burgeoning fields such as AI and third-generation chips: mainly made of materials such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, they can operate at high frequency and in higher power and temperature environments, with broad applications in 5G, military-grade radar and electric vehicles.On Thursday, a key semiconductor industry official called on domestic chip giants to merge with their peers, creating national champions with the wherewithal to compete globally. Apart from SMIC, China’s other prominent chipmakers include state-backed memory giant Tsinghua Group, which is spending billions to expand capacity, and players such as Huawei Technologies Co.’s HiSilicon division and AI specialist Cambricon Technologies Corp.ByteDance Can Engrave Its Patriotism in Silicon: Tim Culpan“More industry integration is needed to improve our resistance to risk. M&A should be encouraged,” Ye Tianchun, vice director of the China Semiconductor Industry Association, told the conference.SMIC’s Shenzhen project would mark one of the few plants in the country focused on larger 12-inch rather than 8-inch wafers, which save on cost because more chips can be spliced from it, but are far more difficult to fabricate. SMIC already operates fabs or fabrication plants in four cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. It will own 55% of the proposed new plant, with a government-owned entity owning up to a 23% stake.“Silicon wafer is a fundamental raw material in semiconductor manufacturing, yet it is also one of the areas in China’s semiconductor supply chain that has the lowest level of local production, especially 12-inch silicon wafers,” Li Wei, executive vice president of the National Silicon Industry Group, a state-backed wafer manufacturer, said at the conference Wednesday.(Updates with SMIC executive’s comments from the second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-china-chipmaker-gets-government-014938446.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-03-17	2021-03-17 21:30:48	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Nears Launch of New iPads After Stay-At-Home Sales Boost	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. plans to announce new iPads as early as April, adding to a product line that has performed particularly well as people work and study from home, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The company is planning a refresh to its iPad Pro line, adding a better processor and improved cameras, the people said. The new models will look similar to the current iPad Pros and come in the same 11-inch and 12.9-inch screen sizes.The devices will have an updated processor that is on par with the faster M1 chip in the latest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac mini. Apple designs these processors itself and typically has them made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Apple is also looking to include a Mini-LED screen with at least the larger model, which would be brighter and have improved contrast ratios.In testing, the new iPad Pros have used a Thunderbolt connector, the same port on the latest Macs with custom Apple processors. The port doesn’t require new chargers, but it would enable connectivity with additional external monitors, hard drives and other peripherals. It’s also faster at syncing data than the USB-C technology used in the current models.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The company has yet to announce its first product launch event of the year, so its plans could change.The iPad generated $8.4 billion in revenue for Apple during the key holiday quarter of 2020, the most since 2014. Sales jumped on demand from people working and studying from home during the pandemic. As employees and students begin returning to offices and schools in coming months, Apple will be betting on the new iPad models to maintain interest in the tablet line.The iPad Pro was last updated in March 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic, adding a tweaked processor, support for the Magic Keyboard with Trackpad case, and a lidar scanner alongside the camera.Apple plans to refresh its cheapest iPad aimed at students with a thinner and lighter design later this year, Bloomberg News has reported. It’s also preparing to launch a new iPad mini with a larger screen as early as this year, an increase from the 7.9-inch display used since the first model. The iPad mini was last upgraded in 2019 with support for the Apple Pencil stylus and a faster processor.Apple has several other product updates planned for this year. The company is working on new iPhones and Apple Watches, an accessory for tracking the location of physical objects, and major updates to the MacBook Pro laptop and iMac desktop.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-nears-launch-ipads-stay-213048103.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-03-17	2021-03-17 08:32:11	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Samsung Warns of Severe Chip Crunch While Delaying Key Phone	(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. warned it’s grappling with the fallout from a “serious imbalance” in semiconductors globally, becoming the largest tech giant to voice concerns about chip shortages spreading beyond the automaking industry.Samsung, one of the world’s largest makers of chips and consumer electronics, expects the crunch to pose a problem to its business next quarter, co-Chief Executive Officer Koh Dong-jin said during an annual shareholders meeting in Seoul. The company is also considering skipping the introduction of a new Galaxy Note -- one of its best-selling models -- this year, though Koh said that was geared toward streamlining its lineup.Industry giants from Continental AG to Renesas Electronics Corp. and Innolux Corp. have in recent weeks warned of longer-than-anticipated deficits thanks to unprecedented Covid-era demand for everything from cars to game consoles and mobile devices. Volkswagen AG said this week it’s lost production of about 100,000 cars worldwide. In North America, the silicon shortage and extreme weather have combined to snarl more production at Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. The fear is the crunch, which first hit automakers hard, may now disrupt the much larger electronics industry.“There’s a serious imbalance in supply and demand of chips in the IT sector globally,” said Koh, who oversees the company’s IT and mobile divisions. “Despite the difficult environment, our business leaders are meeting partners overseas to solve these problems. It’s hard to say the shortage issue has been solved 100%.”Read more: Chip Shortage Spirals Beyond Cars to Phones and ConsolesSamsung, the world’s largest smartphone maker, is working with overseas partners to resolve the imbalance and avert potential setbacks to its business, its co-CEO said. Its shares slid 0.6% in Seoul on Wednesday, while suppliers and Asian chipmakers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SK Hynix Inc. also fell.Chipmakers like Samsung and TSMC are at the forefront of a global effort to plug a shortfall in supply of semiconductors, the building blocks of a plethora of consumer gadgets. The deficit has closed auto plants around the world and now threatens supply of other products. While the Korean company is the leading maker of made-to-order silicon after TSMC, it relies on external suppliers and manufacturers for certain parts like power management and radio chips.Larger-than-anticipated Covid-era demand for smartphones has also stretched stores of Qualcomm Inc.’s Snapdragon chips, the go-to processors for mobile devices. Qualcomm designs the chips, known as app processors, but relies on Samsung and TSMC to produce them and the Taiwanese chipmaker’s capacity has been strained.“The tightened supply of Qualcomm AP chips produced by TSMC is affecting everybody except Apple,” said MS Hwang, analyst at Samsung Securities. “PCs will soon be hit due to the short supply of display driver ICs, and the profitability of TV will be affected by soaring LCD panel prices.”The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeCompounding matters, Samsung’s own production got sideswiped last month. Its fab in Austin, Texas -- which makes chips both for internal and external consumption -- was sidelined in February by statewide power outages and hasn’t resumed full production. The resulting shortfall in production of Qualcomm 5G radio frequency chips could reduce global smartphone output by 5% in the second quarter, research firm Trendforce estimates. But the outage there is likely to affect Samsung’s mid-tier phones and laptops more than its top-of-the-range models or server chips, said Greg Roh, a senior vice president at HMC Securities.“If Samsung is publicly talking about future products, you know that the silicon crunch is serious,” said Avi Greengart, analyst and founder of consultancy Techsponential.Carmakers got hit first by the chip crunch in part because of poor inventory planning and are expected to miss out on $61 billion of sales this year alone. Honda Motor Co. on Wednesday said it will temporarily suspend some production next week at a majority of U.S. and Canada plants, underscoring the deepening crisis.Some analysts say shortages could get mostly ironed out in coming months. But the concern is that tight supply in certain segments -- such as in more mature semiconductors where it takes time to build capacity -- could eventually throttle the broader consumer electronics industry and jack up prices if it persists. Semiconductors are now near the top of official agendas from Washington to Brussels.At the same time, China’s insatiable appetite for chips -- fueled in part by its rapid recovery from the pandemic -- and inventory stockpiling by local companies is fueling demand. Sales for the country’s chip industry climbed 18% to 891.1 billion yuan ($137 billion) in 2020, China Semiconductor Industry Association Chairman Zhou Zixue told a conference in Shanghai Wednesday.“The IC shortage will be a problem to frustrate the supply chain in next six months,” said Charles Shum, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.See, Carmakers, the Chip Shortage Isn’t Personal: Tim CulpanOn Tuesday, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. -- the assembler of most of the world’s iPhones -- joined a chorus of industry executives stressing it’ll take time to resolve imbalances in demand and supply.“We see a shortage, we feel it. But the impact for most of our customers is not that big,” Hon Hai Chairman Young Liu told reporters in Taipei. “For certain customers that have better than expected orders, then there’s some impact. For major customers that plan well, where there’s no big surge on orders, those customers are doing fine.”Koh said Samsung may decide not to introduce its Galaxy Note during 2021’s second half, breaking a years-long streak of annual launches for the marquee line. The Note series contributed roughly 5% of Samsung’s smartphone shipments over the past two years, IDC estimates, but accounts for a more significant chunk of revenue because it’s one of the priciest in the lineup.“Note series is positioned as a high-end model in our business portfolio,” he said. “It could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year so it might be difficult to release Note model in 2H. The timing of Note model launch can be changed but we seek to release a Note model next year.”(Updates with analysts’ comments and details on cutbacks from the third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-warns-serious-imbalance-chips-020444152.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-15	2021-03-15 18:23:37	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	AMD Unleashes 'Milan' Data Center Chip To Fight Intel: Reuters	On Monday, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) released a new data center chip aimed at snatching higher market share from rival Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC), Reuters reports. AMD’s “Milan” data center processor chip was reportedly faster than Intel’s current best data center chips. AMD designed the chip but outsourced its manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (NYSE: TSM), utilizing TSMC’s 7-nanometer chipmaking process. Outsourced manufacturing enabled AMD to capitalize on Intel’s problems, which struggled over internal chip manufacturing delay in its most recent generation of factory technology. The “Milan” chip and its predecessor exceeded Intel’s chips, enabling AMD to gain market share and acquire customers like Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. Analysts expected Intel to shortly launch its latest “Ice Lake” server chip made on Intel’s 10-nanometer manufacturing technology touted as the equivalent of TSMC’s 7-nanometer technology used for AMD’s “Milan” chip. However, AMD is still expected to have a higher number of computing cores on each chip, letting the chip juggle more software applications simultaneously. Price action: AMD shares traded higher by 1.53% at $82.28, and INTC shares are up 0.73% at $63.36 on the last check Monday.

2021-03-15	2021-03-15 09:30:13	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Huawei Pivots to Fish Farms, Mining After U.S. Blocks Its Phones	(Bloomberg) -- Six months after the Trump administration dealt a crushing blow to Huawei Technologies Co.’s smartphone business, the Chinese telecommunications giant is turning to less glamorous alternatives that may eventually offset the decline of its biggest revenue contributor.Among its newest customers is a fish farm in eastern China that’s twice the size of New York’s Central Park. The farm is covered with tens of thousands of solar panels outfitted with Huawei’s inverters to shield its fish from excessive sunlight while generating power. About 370 miles to the west in coal-rich Shanxi province, wireless sensors and cameras deep beneath the earth monitor oxygen levels and potential machine malfunctions in mine pit -- all supplied by the tech titan. And next month, a shiny new electric car featuring its lidar sensor will debut at China’s largest auto show.Once the world’s largest smartphone maker, the Chinese corporation has seen a series of U.S. sanctions almost obliterate its lucrative consumer business. With the Biden administration keeping up the pressure on Huawei, billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei has directed the company to grow its roster of enterprise clients in transportation, manufacturing, agriculture and other industries. Huawei is the world’s leading supplier of inverters and it’s now banking on growing those sales alongside its cloud services and data analytics solutions to help the 190,000-employee business survive.“It’s very unlikely that the U.S. will remove us from the Entity List,” Ren said last month at the opening of a mining innovation laboratory partly sponsored by Huawei. “Right now, we just want to work harder and keep looking for new opportunities to survive.”Ren said the new initiatives may offset the drop in its handset business “more or less within this year,” though the company declined to provide specific figures. Its consumer unit generated revenue of 256 billion yuan ($39 billion) in the first six months of 2020, more than half of the company’s total. It managed “marginal growth” in sales and profit last year, thanks to record 5G base station orders and strong smartphone sales in the first half.Huawei has been exploring business opportunities beyond telecom gear and smartphones for years but the efforts took on new urgency after phone shipments tumbled 42% in the final three months of 2020, largely due to a Trump-era order that cut off its ability to obtain the most advanced semiconductors.The Biden administration has informed some suppliers of tighter conditions on previously approved export licenses, prohibiting items for use in or with 5G devices, according to people familiar with the move. On Friday, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission also included Huawei in a list of companies whose telecommunications and video equipment “pose an unacceptable risk to national security.” Read more: How Huawei Landed at the Center of Global Tech Tussle: QuickTakeThe U.S. ban has had limited impact on Huawei’s emerging businesses, as most of the components required are available from Chinese suppliers, according to a person directly involved in the initiative. To meet the increasing demand from contractors including Huawei, local suppliers are squeezing better performance from mature technologies that Washington hasn’t banned, the person said, declining to be identified discussing internal matters.The most advanced chips in Huawei’s inverters, used to convert the electrical output from solar panels, rely on 28-nanometer technology, which Chinese companies are capable of manufacturing. Other components, such as power modules, can be made by 90nm technology or older. Yangzhou Yangjie Electronic Technology Co. and China Resources Microelectronics Ltd. are among the top power diode producers in China.Each inverter -- slightly bigger than an outdoor unit of a central air conditioner -- can sell for over 20,000 yuan, more than Huawei’s latest high-end Mate X2 foldable phone. The company is planning to roll out more of its photovoltaic inverters, as Beijing’s push to have carbon emissions in the world’s second-largest economy peak by 2030 drive investments in renewable energy.Like its solar inverter business, the chips required for Huawei’s automotive systems are less sophisticated than mobile phone processors and can partly be sourced from European suppliers, according to one person familiar with the matter. That’s allowed Huawei to double down on the car industry, moving engineers from other business units to work on sensors for self-driving cars and power units for electric vehicles.While the company has denied it plans to launch EVs under its own brand, Huawei’s worked with several manufacturers to test its autonomous driving and driver-car interaction technologies. Its entertainment features can be found in Mercedes-Benz sedans and the firm has teamed up with domestic electric automobile makers such as BAIC BluePark New Energy Technology Co. to develop smart car systems. The first model under its partnership with the Chinese EV maker, the Arcfox αS HBT, will be unveiled at Auto Shanghai 2021 in April.Another initiative dubbed 5GtoB involves Huawei deploying 5G technology to areas ranging from health care to airplane manufacturing. The company has helped China build the world’s largest 5G network, supplying more than half of the 720,000 base stations operating across the nation. Now it’s seeking to use the country’s 5G connectivity to help pandemic-hit businesses automate factory lines -- joining fellow tech behemoths such as Xiaomi Corp. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in trying to modernize manufacturing -- and digitize once labor-intensive industries like mining.Huawei has signed over 1,000 5GtoB deals in more than 20 sectors with help from telecom carriers and partners, according to rotating chairman Ken Hu. Online education, entertainment and transportation are among the sectors it plans to explore, he said. The firm in January gave smartphone czar Richard Yu a new role to shepherd its rapidly-growing cloud and AI businesses.“The adoption of 5G in mining, medical services and manufacturing is getting clearer and some of the applications are being used nationwide,” Liu Liehong, vice-minister for industry and information technology, said at an industry event in Shanghai last month.Ren is personally leading the expansion into mining, meeting with local officials and inspecting coal pits in Shanxi province. “Most information communications technology companies didn’t think of mining as a field where they can make market breakthroughs, but we did,” the billionaire told reporters last month. “China has around 5,300 coal mines and 2,700 ore mines. If we can serve these 8,000-plus mines well, we could expand our services to mines outside China.”Read more: China’s Coal Industry Fights for Survival in a Greener WorldWhile Huawei’s betting that inverters, electronic mining solutions and smart car software may compensate for the decline of smartphones, its longer-term future -- and its ability to continue powering China’s 5G roll-out -- remains clouded. Its HiSilicon subsidiary had been the country’s most capable chipset designer, making the high-end processors that power the company’s smartphones and wireless base stations, before Washington cut off access to the latest chip-design software and contract manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.For now, the company has told its wireless customers it has enough communications chips to support base station constructions in 2021. But it’s unclear how long those stocks can last, and what options Huawei has once those inventories eventually deplete. Wireless operators have been cautious on their 5G build-out and there is “plenty of uncertainty” whether Huawei will be able to continue providing equipment in the longer term, Jefferies analyst Edison Lee wrote in a note earlier this month. “The ongoing political frictions have cast shadows on the business operations of Huawei and other Chinese firms in the foreseeable future and strategic investment in emerging technologies is key to Huawei’s sustainable business growth,” said Charlie Dai, principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc.(Updates with FCC designation in seventh paragraph, analyst’s comment in second-last paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-pivots-fish-farms-mining-210000360.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-03-15	2021-03-15 06:17:29	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Nintendo Targets a Record Year in Switch, Game Sales	(Bloomberg) -- Nintendo Co. is gearing up for record software and Switch sales in the coming year, a much stronger performance than investors are projecting, according to the company’s partners and suppliers.Kyoto-based Nintendo is planning for sales of its signature Switch game console to be flat or slightly higher in the fiscal year ending March 2022, boosted by the introduction of a version with an OLED display, according to executives at allies including component suppliers, software publishers and retailers. Analysts have forecast console sales would decline next year.A series of marquee game releases is expected to drive software sales next fiscal year to 250 million units, far more than the record 205 million units forecast for the current year, according to the partners and suppliers, speaking anonymously as the plans are not public. Analysts have also projected software sales would fall next year.Some of the suppliers have been briefed while other partners established their own forecasts based on orders. A Nintendo spokesman declined to comment.Nintendo’s shares reversed early morning losses and finished up 1.6% in Tokyo on Monday.Read more: Nintendo Plans Switch Model With Bigger Samsung OLED DisplayThe coronavirus outbreak was at first a brake and then an accelerant for Nintendo, choking its supply and logistics before triggering a demand surge with global lockdowns driving people to seek entertainment and escape. The company’s Animal Crossing: New Horizons turned into the ideal virtual hangout for stress relief, juicing Switch sales and hastening the transition from packaged software to digital downloads.“Nintendo will need to start the next fiscal year without Animal Crossing and the pandemic, but that will be offset by a much stronger blockbuster software lineup and new hardware,” Serkan Toto of game consultancy Kantan Games Inc. said.Nintendo plans to release a revised version of the Switch in the latter half of this year with a larger and better display as well as upgraded graphics when the hybrid console is plugged into a TV set, Bloomberg News has reported. The company makes some of the biggest blockbuster games on its platform, which contribute significantly to profit and also spur hardware adoption. Much of this year’s lineup of new games remains unannounced.Read more: Nintendo Plans Switch Model With Bigger Samsung OLED DisplayThe Switch and Switch Lite continue to sell well, due in part to poor supply of Sony Corp.’s PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox Series X released in November, according to Astris Advisory Japan’s David Gibson. But the lack of visibility around Nintendo’s upcoming games slate has prompted skepticism about the company sustaining its recent success.“With or without an upgraded Switch, Nintendo’s hardware sales would probably decrease in the year from April,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Matthew Kanterman.Read more: Nintendo Raises Outlook After Surpassing High ExpectationsNintendo’s ability to fulfill demand for the Switch will be challenged by the same global chip supply bottleneck that has troubled its rivals. Beyond securing silicon from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the Switch maker also faces scarcity of more generic parts like display driver integrated circuits and Bluetooth modules, people familiar with its operations said. Component suppliers said shortages would persist at least until June and the situation may not improve for the rest of the year.Read more: Chip Shortages Could Extend into Next Year, Innolux WarnsMakers of NAND flash memory -- the media on which packaged Switch software is sold -- are preparing more units for the coming fiscal year than they supplied in the current one, the people involved in the supply chain said. Software developers similarly are prioritizing the Switch for their upcoming game releases as the console is almost certain to surpass the 100 million units sold threshold, assuring a large audience of potential customers. Nintendo had sold 80 million Switch devices as of the end of 2020.Games announced for this year so far include several Pokémon titles and popular third-party games such as Fall Guys by Mediatonic. Though Nintendo’s release schedule for the second half of the year remains vacant, it delivered a positive surprise by announcing Splatoon 3 for 2022 last month, said Astris Advisory’s Gibson, indicating a strong games pipeline for the long term.“The Switch is in the middle of its life cycle,” Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said in February.Read more: China Is Nintendo’s Secret Weapon in War With PlayStation, Xbox(Updates with share price in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nintendo-targets-record-switch-game-040000448.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-12	2021-03-12 03:30:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Carmakers’ Chip Shortages May Last into Late 2021, Renesas Says	(Bloomberg) -- Renesas Electronics Corp.’s top executive warned that a global shortage of auto semiconductors may persist into the second half, joining other industry leaders in bracing for a chip crunch to snarl production of cars and gadgets well past the summer.Industry giants from Continental AG to Innolux Corp. have in recent weeks warned of longer-than anticipated deficits thanks to unprecedented Covid-era demand for everything from cars to game consoles and smartphones. Renesas is running its most critical plants at full capacity to try and sate demand but there was no way of telling when the market might balance out, Chief Executive Officer Hidetoshi Shibata told Bloomberg News.“Supply will remain tight through the first half of the year,” Shibata said this week. “And the way things look now, the situation will continue into the second half. But it’s anyone’s guess.”Chipmakers like Renesas and its partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. are at the forefront of a global effort to plug a shortfall in supply of chips, the building blocks of a plethora of consumer products. Carmakers got hit first in part because of poor inventory planning and are expected to miss out on $61 billion of sales this year alone.Some analysts say shortages could get mostly ironed out in coming months. But the concern is that tight supply in certain segments -- such as in more mature semiconductors where it takes time to build capacity -- could eventually throttle the broader consumer electronics industry and jack up prices if it persists. Semiconductors are now near the top of official agendas from Washington to Brussels.The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeRenesas, which vies with NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG to supply automakers, is a prime barometer for the sector. It gets about half its revenue from car chips and counts all the major automakers among its clients, including Toyota Motor Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. It also outsources some production of more advanced chips to TSMC, the world’s largest contract manufacturer.The company’s 200-millimeter wafer line on the southern island of Kyushu is operating near full capacity while its 300-millimeter fab in Naka, north of Tokyo, is in “overdrive.” For every 40-nanometer microcontroller it makes at the Naka fab, it orders six from TSMC, a proportion that hasn’t changed with the shortage, Shibata said.Both plants make chips used in automotive and industrial applications and are a better representation of the tightening supply than the 60% overall factory utilization Renesas reported last month. The Kyushu line makes mid- to low-end microcontrollers while the fab in Naka also makes 40-nanometer microcontrollers and system-on-chip devices, and 90-nanometer analog chips for car applications.“Nothing can be done about those,” Shibata said. “They are running at the limit of their capacity.”What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysSubaru, Honda and Nissan may suffer output losses due to chip shortages while Toyota looks set to experience less impact, leading to performance differences between Japanese carmakers in coming months. Mitsubishi Electric and Renesas may see little impact but supply of chips from foundries including TSMC could struggle.- Tatsuo Yoshida and Masahiro Wakasugi, analystsClick here for the research.It’s not yet clear whether Renesas will emerge as a beneficiary of the supply crunch, but one broader benefit is a deeper appreciation of the importance of the tiny devices to the global economy, Shibata said. That recognition is long overdue, he said.“Cars are increasingly turning into electronic devices and it’s breaking the traditional supply chain models,” Shibata said. “That much has been made clear. Now that everyone has noticed, maybe we can have a constructive conversation about this.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carmakers-chip-shortages-may-last-033000312.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-10	2021-03-10 08:20:51	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Taiwan Probe Spurs Fears of China Poaching Top Chip Talent	(Bloomberg) -- An investigation into illegal talent poaching by Beijing-based Bitmain Technologies Ltd. has revived fears Chinese companies will target Taiwan’s top engineers as their country works to build a world-class chipmaking industry.Investigators descended on the offices of Bitmain’s two Taiwan units and interviewed 19 people Tuesday in a probe into whether the crypto-mining startup had violated local laws, according to Chang Jui-chuan, a spokeswoman for the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office. The Chinese firm, which develops semiconductors for mining and other purposes, is suspected of illegally recruiting hundreds of engineers from Taiwanese firms over a period of three years. Taiwan prohibits firms from China from doing business or recruiting locally without prior approval, a measure intended to limit the influence of its political rival.The accusations against Bitmain spur concerns that Chinese firms will accelerate efforts to hire away Taiwan’s best engineers in a bid to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency. Beijing has pledged to develop its own advanced chip manufacturing in order to dominate future technologies and cut its dependence on $300 billion of annual semiconductor imports.Read more: China to Pour More Money Into Chips, AI and 5G to Catch U.S.Taiwan’s deep pool of expertise revolves around Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s leading chip fabricator and a supplier to most American tech giants from Apple Inc. to Nvidia Corp. U.S. and European companies like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and ASML Holding NV have set up engineering hubs and research bases to tap local talent.“China’s poaching of Taiwanese engineers undermines Taiwan’s semiconductor industry,” said Carol Lin, a law professor at the Hsinchu-based National Chiao Tung University, which is now part of the newly formed National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. “Through the maneuver, Chinese competitors can learn about Taiwan companies’ progress. If these engineers bring trade secrets with them, Chinese rivals can have a firm grasp of Taiwan companies’ past success and failure in technological developments, and this could result in unfair competition and even endanger national security.”Beijing has denied Washington’s claims that it demands technology or talent transfers or targets the intellectual property of overseas firms. Bitmain representatives didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.Read more: The World Is Dangerously Dependent on Taiwan for SemiconductorsBitmain’s actions are suspected of breaching Taiwan’s Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, Chang said. An article in the act stipulates that for-profit Chinese firms cannot set up units in Taiwan and conduct business activities -- including headhunting -- without approval from Taiwanese authorities, she added.A separate press statement from Chang’s office, while not identifying Bitmain by name, shed light on the allegations. In order to develop artificial intelligence chips, the Chinese startup created a new entity in China with a Taiwanese engineer as chairman. This engineer then recruited colleagues from his former company in Taiwan and formed a headhunting team to set up a research and development center in Taiwan, according to the statement. Chang confirmed the company in the press release was Bitmain.The team offered potential recruits double their existing salaries and advertised openly on Taiwanese job sites, the prosecutors said. The country’s top chip designer MediaTek Inc., a major rival to Qualcomm Inc., was affected by Bitmain’s recruitment drive, Taiwan’s Apple Daily reported. A MediaTek representative declined to comment.Taiwanese executives have accused Chinese rivals of aggressive poaching for years. In 2018, Taiwanese DRAM maker Nanya Technology Corp. President Lee Pei-ing said some of his engineers were being offered three to five times their current salaries by Chinese competitors. The typical practice was to first lure away a manager who would then go on to recruit more of his former colleagues, according to Lee.Beyond talent poaching, global firms with operations in Taiwan and local officials have accused Chinese companies of technology theft. In 2019, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted five people for leaking tech belonging to German chemical maker BASF SE to Jiangyin Jianghua Microelectronics Materials Co., while Micron Technology Inc. has sued Taiwan’s United Microelectronics Corp. and its Chinese partner Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. for stealing trade secrets. Both Chinese companies have denied wrongdoing.Read more: Engineers Found Guilty of Stealing Micron Secrets for ChinaBitmain, the world’s largest crypto-mining equipment maker, has over the years tried to expand into AI chipmaking to cushion Bitcoin’s volatility, but the strategy divided its management.

2021-03-08	2021-03-08 10:17:49	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Taiwan Has Enough Water to Keep Chipmakers Humming Till May	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan offered reassurances Monday it has sufficient water reserves to keep a giant tech industry led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. humming till late May, when monsoon rains arrive to alleviate its worst drought in decades.The island should have enough water to supply the public and industry till then though precipitation is likely to fall short of average historical levels, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua told reporters Monday. The drought has so far exerted no impact on TSMC nor other companies, Wang added.Taiwan faces its worst drought in 56 years, a challenge to water-intensive sectors of the economy from chipmakers to textile factories and farms. The heightened level of concern coincides with a global shortage of semiconductors that’s halting output at automakers from General Motors Co. to Volkswagen AG, spurring TSMC and its peers to run their fabs at close to full capacity to try and sate demand.On Sunday, President Tsai Ing-wen said on her Facebook page her government will do everything in its power to stabilize supply. Chipmaking consumes enormous quantities of both power and water. U.S., Japanese and European officials have urged the Taiwanese government to do all it can to ensure a steady supply of chips as automakers in their countries delay production and idle plants due to a lack of crucial components.The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeTSMC has trimmed usage and ordered small amounts of water by the truckload for some of its facilities to prepare for potential water-use restrictions, spokeswoman Nina Kao said in an email. Longer term, the island is setting aside NT$17 billion to build 11 recycling plants by 2026.Spanning the Tropic of Cancer in the western Pacific Ocean, Taiwan typically receives copious amounts of rainfall. But last year was abnormally dry by historical standards. Hsinchu City, home to the likes of TSMC and MediaTek Inc., received just half the amount of rain in 2020 than it did the year before. The southern city of Tainan, another major center of technology manufacturing, also saw a significant drop-off in the amount of rain.About 70% of Taiwan’s water supply goes toward agriculture while industrial production uses just 20%. The remainder is for residential and commercial use, Taiwan’s Water Resources Agency Deputy Director-General Wang Yi-fung said in an interview Monday.Recent conservation measures, including fallowing some farmland, has helped save some 701 million tons of water. That ensures Taiwan has enough water till late May, with an additional month’s supply cushion, he added. Taiwan uses about 16 billion to 17 billion tons of water annually, the official said.Typhoons are usually an important source of precipitation but they didn’t deliver for Taiwan last year. Not a single typhoon made landfall in all of 2020. Over the past century, the island is hit by between three and four typhoons each year on average, according to the island’s Central Weather Bureau.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-enough-water-keep-chipmakers-101749731.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-03	2021-03-03 08:46:53	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	China Revs Up Grand Chip Ambitions to Counter U.S. Blacklistings	(Bloomberg) -- In just two decades, China sent people into space, built its own aircraft carrier and developed a stealth fighter jet. Now the world’s youngest superpower is setting out to prove its capabilities once more -- this time in semiconductors.At stake is nothing less than the future of the world’s No. 2 economy. Beijing’s blueprint for chip supremacy is enshrined in a five-year economic vision to be unveiled during a summit of top leaders in the capital this week. It’s a multi-layered strategy both pragmatic and ambitious in scope, embracing aspirations to replace pivotal U.S. suppliers and fend off Washington, while molding homegrown champions in emergent technologies.China wants to build a coterie of technology giants that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., conferring the same priority on that effort as it accorded to building atomic capability. While specifics of that endeavor won’t emerge for months, comments by government officials, Party mouthpieces like the People’s Daily and state think-tanks provide important clues about the envisioned road map.Read more: Xi Mobilizes China for Tech Revolution to Cut Dependence on WestThe approach entails making do over the next five years or so with aging semiconductors that are adequate for electric cars and even military applications, but can’t run advanced smartphones and similar devices. That buys China time to focus on fields like so-called third-generation chipmaking in which no country yet dominates and -- Beijing hopes -- create an array of indigenous giants in areas including machinery, software and new materials. The ultimate goal is to groom local alternatives to global linchpins like Cadence Inc. and Synopsys Inc. in design software and Europe’s ASML Holding NV in chipmaking gear.“Semiconductors are a crucial sector in the information era that will lead the future of economic development,” Science & Technology Minister Wang Zhigang said at a press conference last week. “At the same time, China will strive to achieve self reliance and strengthen our own capabilities.”The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeChina’s efforts gained urgency because the Biden administration is escalating a battle against what it called “techno-autocracies.” That could extend or even expand blacklistings that banned key transactions with corporations from Huawei Technologies Co. to ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. To a country that imports $300 billion of chips annually, a worsening global shortage drives home the risk of relying on potentially hostile suppliers for the building blocks of everything from artificial intelligence to sixth-generation networking and autonomous vehicles.It will take years for local companies to match foreign counterparts in manufacturing and design expertise, during which there’s no ready answer to the dominance of Japanese and American names in chipmaking equipment. Chinese companies will still only supply 35% of its domestic demand by the end of this decade, IDC analyst Mario Morales estimates.They’ll also have to contend with Washington. The U.S. signaled it intends to go ahead with a Trump administration-proposed rule to secure the technology supply chain next month, a move that gives the Department of Commerce broad authority to prohibit transactions involving “foreign adversaries” like China.“The United States and its allies should utilize targeted export controls on high-end semiconductor manufacturing equipment ... to protect existing technical advantages and slow the advancement of China’s semiconductor industry,” the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, headed up by former Google chairman Eric Schmidt, recommended to Biden and Congress this week.Huawei, the country’s largest technology company by revenue, underscores the leverage Washington wields. Once the world’s biggest smartphone maker, Huawei was forced to sell its Honor division and run at close to minimum production capacity after it lost access to chips from the likes of TSMC under American regulations.Read more: China Said to Plan Broad Chip Sector Support to Fight Trump“It just stimulates the Chinese community to accelerate their internal developments and eventually they may come out even stronger,” said Luc Van den hove, president of the Imec research center in Leuven, Belgium, which focuses on innovation in semiconductor technology. “And I think that’s certainly a risk of trying to keep the two worlds further apart.”Read more: Biden Putting Tech, Not Troops, at Center of U.S.-China StrategyBeijing had set aside at the start of its last five-year plan around 1 trillion yuan ($155 billion) for potential investment in semiconductors over five to 10 years, according to McKinsey. It will now continue to bankroll research and investment in coming years, Wang said last week. China will increase fiscal support for scientific research and encourage leading companies to join national programs, he added. That should galvanize the much larger influx of private capital needed to produce genuine breakthroughs.It’s an approach that’s worked before for the internet, where a mix of government and private capital helped build the likes of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing Inc. In February, the state-backed Global Times reported smartphone makers Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo acquired stakes in Jiangsu Changjing Electronics Technology Co., exemplifying the sort of private-sector involvement Beijing’s counting on.When it comes to the chips, “we will see more support relative to private firms, because they play a bigger role in those sectors,” said Wendy Leutert, GLP-Ming Z. Mei Chair of Chinese Economics and Trade at Indiana University.Read more: The U.S.-China Conflict Over Chips Is About to Get UglierIn the meantime, up-and-comers such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and Tsinghua Unigroup can help tide the country over a deficit of mobile processors, memory and telecom modules should Washington close off supply routes. They will mainly operate mature processes of 14 nanometers and older, sufficient for all but the most exacting applications such as smartphones, high-performance computing and graphics processors. Meanwhile, global leader TSMC is ramping up for mass production of 3 nm chips in 2022, about five or six generations ahead.At the same time, they’ll act as focal points for the country’s most capable brains to work on stop-gap measures such as advanced packaging that can improve chip computing power in the absence of more sophisticated U.S. technology. The hope is that such fine-tuning buys time for the homegrown development of advanced technologies, such as in 7-nanometer chips and silicon design software.Some of the key local players in that space include Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment Co. and Naura Technology Group Co., who are working on equipment that can someday replace ASML’s extreme ultra-violet lithography or EUV machines -- a prerequisite for any advanced chipmaking.Local startups like Empyrean are trying to replicate the similarly indispensable software tools licensed by Synopsys and Cadence, employed by most of the world’s chip designers from Intel on down. Even in the commoditized realm of memory, a subsidiary of state-backed Tsinghua Unigroup is spending billions on mass production to challenge Samsung Electronics Co. and Micron Technology Inc.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysTSMC may lose market share in China in the next three years to local contract chipmakers such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International. These Chinese peers are accelerating advance-node technology development and will likely gain orders from local chip designers such as Will Semiconductor and Unisoc, which are trying to avoid dependence on U.S. technology due to bilateral trade tensions and the risk of sanctions.- Charles Shum and Masahiro Wakasugi, analystsClick here for the research.Read more: China Still Buying $300 Billion of Chips From U.S., ElsewherePresident Xi Jinping has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies ranging from wireless networks to AI. A big chunk of that is geared toward semiconductors.Chinese firms such as Tsinghua will be responsible for building half the world’s 30-odd new fabrication plants or fabs in the next two years alone. It’s already spending 2.4 times more than the U.S. on semiconductor equipment, much of it made by American companies, Morales wrote in a report.The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeThe bet is that its corporations can compete if they accelerate research into burgeoning, adjacent fields like AI and quantum computing now. That’s where third-generation chips come in. Those are mainly made of materials such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, can operate at high frequency and in higher power and temperature environments, with broad applications in fifth-generation radio frequency chips, military-grade radar and electric vehicles.The country may secure first-mover advantage, even if traditional silicon-based semiconductors will continue to account for the vast majority of global use for the foreseeable future, Citigroup analysts have said. U.S.-based Cree Inc. and Japan’s Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. are just beginning to grow this business, while Chinese rivals such as Sanan Optoelectronics Co. and state-owned China Electronics Technology Group Corp. have made inroads.The country’s other chipmakers, which include SMIC, Will Semiconductor Ltd. and National Silicon Industry Group Co., benefit more broadly from the state support.“The investment commitment that China is making ensures that the Chinese semiconductor ecosystem will continue to play an important role in the progress of our industry and the overall IT market,” said IDC’s Morales.(Updates with China’s comment on research in the 12th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-revs-grand-chip-ambitions-210000983.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-03-03	2021-03-03 08:46:38	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Samsung Details Plans for $17 Billion Chip Facility in U.S.	(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. revealed additional details about its plans to build a cutting-edge semiconductor facility in the U.S. in a filing with the Texas government, making the disclosure as the Biden administration vows to make the security of the U.S. chip supply a national priority.The South Korean company plans to invest about $17 billion in its Project Silicon Silver and create about 1,800 jobs over the first ten years, according to an economic impact study prepared by a local consultant. Some $5.1 billion would go into buildings and property improvements, while $9.9 billion would be spent on machinery and equipment.The filing with the Texas comptroller warned the chips project is “highly competitive.” Samsung is evaluating alternatives sites in Arizona and New York, as well as in Korea.“Because of its strong ties to the local community and the successful past 25 years of manufacturing in Texas, Samsung Austin Semiconductor would like to continue to invest in the city and the state,” the study said.Biden Putting Tech, Not Troops, at Core of U.S.-China Policy (1)In their first weeks in office, Joe Biden’s administration has emphasized the importance of advanced technologies, including semiconductors, artificial intelligence and next-generation networks. The president has ordered a global supply chain review for microchips as well as large-capacity batteries, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals and strategic materials such as rare earths.Bloomberg News first reported in January that Samsung was considering building an advanced chipmaking plant in the U.S., in hopes of winning more American clients and narrowing the gap with industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The company was in discussions to locate a facility in Austin, Texas, capable of fabricating chips as advanced as 3 nanometers, people familiar with the matter said at the time.Details of Samsung’s discussions with local governments have since leaked out in filings and other revelations. The economic impact study was prepared by Impact DataSource LLC, an Austin, Texas-based economic consulting, research and analysis firm.The report shows Samsung’s Project Silicon Silver would add approximately 7 million square feet of new space to the Austin campus, where the company has had operations for decades. It estimates that 542 new workers would move to the city, contributing to an addition of 1,626 new residents.Property tax abatements would total about $1.5 billion over 20 years at the city and county levels, while direct and indirect economic output would be about $8.6 billion and salaries would total $7.3 billion.A January filing detailed the likely timeline for the project. If Samsung chooses Austin, it would break ground in the second quarter of 2021 with the expectation that production would be up and running by the fourth quarter of 2023, it said.Separately, Samsung’s current foundry plant in Austin hasn’t resumed operations since Feb. 16 after it was ordered to halt operations by Austin Energy due to blackouts in the region. Power and water are back but it will take more time to fully restart operations, officials said.(Updates with timeline for project in penultimate paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-details-plans-17-billion-084638296.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-03-02	2021-03-02 21:14:24	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Chip Machinery Makers Emerge as Big Winners in Supply Crunch	(Bloomberg) -- The sudden shortage of semiconductors is disrupting automotive production and limiting revenue growth for Apple Inc. It’s created a stock market boon, however, for the makers of chip production equipment.Those companies have emerged as the biggest winners from the supply crunch as chipmakers rush to add more factory capacity. Applied Materials Inc., the world’s biggest equipment maker, has seen its shares advance 36% this year, making it the best performer in a semiconductor index. Brooks Automation Inc., Lam Research Corp. and KLA Corp. are each up more than 19%, nearly twice the gain in the Philadelphia semiconductor index. The stocks fell on Tuesday amid a broad technology slump following a two-day rally.Expanding equipment budgets by major chipmakers and governments concerned about foreign dominance of production facilities are giving Wall Street increasing confidence that the rally has staying power.“Over the next three to five years, this is definitely very bullish for semicap equipment in terms of overall tightness and focus on domestic supply,” said Krish Sankar, an analyst with Cowen & Co.The shortfall is a problem that seemed unthinkable a year ago when a rapidly spreading Covid-19 virus sent economic activity plummeting as companies began efforts to reduce production in anticipation of ebbing sales. Instead, after an initial shock, sales in many industries surged and companies scrambled to boost inventories. Many chipmakers are now producing at maximum capacity and governments are suddenly looking at a dearth of homegrown plants as a national security risk.Supply CrunchU.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order last week to review the country’s supply chains for semiconductors and other products. While there aren’t expected to be any quick fixes, industry watchers say the long-term trend is clear: more equipment will be needed.“The semiconductor industry is running on all cylinders, and you’re seeing companies that might in the past have been reluctant to commit to capex (capital expenditures) now all of a sudden trying to ramp up as quickly as they can,” said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager with Synovus Trust Co., which owns shares of Applied Materials.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which produces chips for Apple and Broadcom Inc., plans to spend $12 billion to construct a plant in Arizona. Some of the costs for that facility were included in the company’s capital spending plans for 2021 that sparked a rally in chip related stocks around the world in January. Broadcom’s capital outlays could total as much as $28 billion, up from $17 billion in 2020.Huge manufacturers like Taiwan Semi building smaller plants in new regions creates particularly attractive opportunities for Applied Materials, Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said on the Santa Clara, California-based company’s earnings call last month.“You have to look at the scale of the factories they’re building and at least what’s been announced is smaller scale,” he said. “That somewhat less efficient factory size is a positive for Applied.”In addition to Applied Materials, top picks for Cowen’s Sankar include Lam Research and MKS Instruments Inc.“You have an environment where demand is very strong, supply is constrained and then you add to it domestic supply build out,” the analyst said in an interview. “At some point these things will normalize, but it won’t be any time soon.”(Updates chart and closes shares in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chip-machinery-makers-emerge-biggest-145146822.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-01	2021-03-01 12:46:51	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	China Region Declares War on Crypto Mining, Stirring Wider Fear	(Bloomberg) -- China’s Inner Mongolia has banned cryptocurrency mining and declared it will shut all such projects by April, spurring fears the world’s No. 2 economy will take more steps to eradicate the power-hungry practice.The autonomous region, a favorite among the industry because of its cheap power, also banned new digital coin projects, according to a draft plan posted on the Inner Mongolia Development and Reform Commission’s website Feb. 25. The aim is to constrain growth in energy consumption to about 1.9% in 2021.Bitcoin extended gains on Monday amid reports of the move, increasing as much as 6% in the session to $47,970.The announcement unnerved an industry that’s already been through a years-long Chinese campaign to clamp down amid concerns over speculative bubbles, fraud and energy waste. The draft policy was released weeks after China’s top economic planner blasted Inner Mongolia for being the only province to fail to control energy consumption in 2019.The region now aims to cut emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 3% this year and limit incremental growth of energy consumption to about 5 million tons of standard coal, according to the draft plan.Chinese officials first outlined proposals in 2018 to discourage crypto-mining -- the computing process that makes transactions with virtual currencies possible but consumes vast amounts of power.Inner Mongolia, which is clustered with large coal mines, is famous for inexpensive energy and has attracted investment from a plethora of power-intensive sectors such as aluminum and ferro-alloy smelting over past decades. The region accounted for 8% of global Bitcoin mining computing power, according to the Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index compiled by Cambridge University. China overall had over 65% of the network’s total, with its appealing combination of inexpensive electricity, local chipmaking factories and cheap labor.Bitcoin Is Red Hot. Can It Ever Be Green?: QuickTakeThe local crackdown is reviving old fears. Beijing since 2017 has abolished initial coin offerings and clamped down on virtual currency trading within its borders, forcing many exchanges overseas.

The company intends to raise $575 million (NT$16 billion) in a debt offering in three parts via auction, Bloomberg reports. The issuance amount is subjected to changes. The recent rise in global corporate bond yields could act as a dampener for the offering. Recently Taiwan Economic Minister Wang Mei-Hua assured support to the U.S. as the latter reached out to tackle the auto chip crisis. TSM disclosed its plans to raise its capital expenditure to $28 billion to solve the crisis, including a $12 billion plant in Arizona. It led to the approval of NT$120 billion debt offering and dollar note issuance guarantee up to $4.5 billion. The initiative could not have been more appropriately timed, considering the key component crisis plaguing everything from smartphones, televisions, and cars. Price action: TSM shares are down 0.88% at $131.23 on the last check Thursday.

The staggering sum would help expand its technological lead and fund construction of a planned $12 billion plant in the southwestern U.S. state of Arizona. The company’s board approved a plan this month to raise up to NT$120 billion of unsecured corporate bonds in Taiwan, as well as the provision of a guarantee to a unit for dollar note issuance up to $4.5 billion.“TSMC needs funds for building its U.S. factory,” and it may decide later in the year to increase its debt issuance plans, according to Baker Tu, a trader at Capital Securities Corp.

2021-02-24	2021-02-24 23:47:47	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Nvidia Slips on Concern About Growth of Data Center Business	(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares slipped on concern about growth of the company’s data center chip business.During an earnings conference call, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the majority of growth in the current period will come from Nvidia’s gaming business. Some analysts worried that means the data center division will expand more slowly and they asked several questions on the topic during the call.Nvidia reported data center chip sales jumped 97% to $1.9 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter from a year earlier. It also gave a revenue forecast that beat Wall Street expectations. However, the CFO’s comments on the conference call curbed enthusiasm for a stock that has more than doubled in the past year.The stock fell about 2.5% in extended trading, after closing at $579.96 in New York earlier on Wednesday.The company has become a barometer of confidence at some of the biggest tech companies. Cloud providers such as Google and Amazon.com Inc. use Nvidia graphics chips to help power some of the most widely used services on the internet. That business is choppy, with spikes in orders followed by lulls as customers use up stockpiles of chips.Right now, the semiconductor sector is struggling to meet surging demand in some parts of the industry, and Nvidia has been caught up in this.An increase in online activity and purchases of technology gear for working from home triggered a sharp rebound in chip demand last year. That caught some customers off guard, especially automakers. New orders flooded in and the global semiconductor supply chain is still trying to catch up. Nvidia outsources production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., which are swamped with orders. That’s limiting Nvidia’s ability to meet demand.“Throughout our supply chain, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components, particularly in Gaming,” Kress said.QuickTake: Here’s Why the World Is Short of Computer Chips.Nvidia is supply constrained “at the company level,” Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said. It has enough supply to grow throughout this year, and some segments like data center won’t be hurt by chip shortages, he added.Revenue will be about $5.3 billion in the period ending in April, the Santa Clara, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $4.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The chipmaker is seeing a surge in orders for PC gaming gear from consumers stuck at home in the pandemic and looking for entertainment. Nvidia’s graphics chips are also important components in machines that run the code needed to create Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. The price of Bitcoin has soared in recent months.Huang has built on Nvidia’s strength in PC gaming graphics chips by taking the company into new markets such as artificial intelligence processing in data centers and components for autonomous vehicles.Revenue from gaming was $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 67% from the same period last year.During previous run ups in the price of cryptocurrencies, Nvidia experienced surging demand followed by crashes sparked by price drops and the switch to more customized technology. The company has tried to minimize this volatility by offering different chips specifically for crypto mining. That reduces the risk that Nvidia’s gaming chips are dumped back into the market when crypto customers realized they don’t need them.Last September, Nvidia agreed to buy SoftBank Group Corp.’s chip division Arm Ltd. for $40 billion, in a bid to control of some of the most widely used electronics technology. The two are seeking regulatory approval around the world. Arm customers including Google, Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are worried about the deal and have urged antitrust officials to intervene.Fiscal fourth quarter revenue rose 61% to $5 billion and profit excluding certain costs was $3.10 a share in the period, which ended Jan. 31, the company said. Analysts, on average, predicted earnings of $2.81 a share on sales of $4.82 billion.(Updates with CFO comments in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-gives-bullish-forecast-gaming-214714526.html?.tsrc=rss

The global semiconductor chip crisis has compelled U.S. automakers, including Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F) and General Motors Co (NYSE: GM) and other manufacturers, to opt for production holidays. Recently a group of U.S. chip companies, including Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC), Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MU), and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD), sought Biden’s assistance to solve the crisis. Biden is slated to meet with a bilateral group of House and Senate lawmakers to discuss the pandemic-induced supply-chain issues. The executive order is estimated to seek a 100-day supply chain review in four areas, including semiconductors used in products from cars to phones, large-capacity batteries for electric vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and vital rare-earth elements for technology and defense. Interestingly, China rules the rare-earths market and is a major player in multiple supply areas, including pharmaceuticals. The order is timed when the U.S. intends to forge ties with different supplier countries and shun relations with China. Major U.S. semiconductor companies have outsourced their chip production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTC: SSNLF). Samsung has been assured federal incentives in return for a factory in New York. TSM recently disclosed plans for a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona to come online by 2024. The order is estimated to seek a one-year review of supply chains encompassing six sectors, from technology to food production. The order will be focused on domestic production with incentives including job-training programs and business loans, including the federal procurement process for more American-made purchases. It will also include certain import limitations. The Defense Production Act, covering vaccine production, could also be a part of the order. The government is expected to focus on public-private partnerships while improving relations with allies to address common supply vulnerabilities, including semiconductors. The executive order will be linked to Biden’s plans towards U.S. job creation, mainly in the manufacturing sector that has faced intense foreign competition. The long-term executive order is expected to incorporate the short-term chip crisis. On Monday, Taiwan’s Economic Minister Wang Mei-Hua acknowledged receipt of a letter from the White House on the global shortage of auto chips and assured a resolution.

On Monday, it introduced the 17,999-yuan ($2,800) Mate X2 that unfolds into an 8-inch (203mm) screen powered by Huawei’s own 5G Kirin 9000 chip.Once the world’s biggest smartphone maker, Huawei was forced to dig into a dwindling store of chips after Washington cut it off from American technology and key suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Yet billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei has vowed to keep its smartphone business, dismissing reports of a potential sale. The company is now focusing on serving enterprise clients to offset the lost business.“We managed marginal growth both in sales and profit,” Ken Hu, the company’s current rotating chairman, told the Mobile World Congress in Shanghai Tuesday. “We’ll work with partners on how to apply Huawei products in their businesses. Through these partnerships, we are not only hoping Huawei can develop a number of solutions from zero, but also duplicating these solutions in scale.”Read more: Huawei’s Quarterly Revenue Growth Slows, Hit by U.S. SanctionsHuawei has been running phone production at close to minimum capacity to preserve its existing cache of components and prolong the life-cycle of its devices, spurring product shortages at retailers across the country, according to people familiar with the matter.The Mate X2 will go on sale in China on Feb. 25, priced at 18,999 yuan for a beefier version with 512 gigabytes of storage. It’ll run a version of Google’s Android tailored for China, which lacks the U.S. company’s core apps and commercial features, but can be updated to Huawei’s own Harmony operating system in April.“We have prepared enough capacity for Mate X2, the capacity is growing on daily basis,” Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei’s consumer electronics unit, said at a launch event in Shanghai on Monday.Yu said Monday that more of the company’s top-tier phones will be powered by its in-house software rather than Android in future.Read more: Huawei’s Founder Vows To Keep Making Smartphones in Biden EraHuawei found itself thrust into the heart of U.S.-Chinese tensions in 2019 after the White House labeled it a national security threat and later imposed a series of trading restrictions. Those curbs curtailed its growth and forced the company to sell off its low-end Honor devices arm last year.Ren has urged the new U.S. administration to adopt an “open policy” toward Huawei, which in turn would benefit its American suppliers. But Biden’s nominee for Commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, said during her Senate confirmation process she knew of “no reason” why Trump-era curbs shouldn’t continue.Huawei’s smartphone shipments dived 42% in the last three months of 2020 while its biggest competitors Samsung Electronics Co., Apple Inc. and Xiaomi Corp. all gained market share, according to researcher IDC.Read more: Samsung’s $1,999 Fold 2 Rectifies Major Foldable Phone FoiblesFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-unveils-foldable-phone-despite-133202108.html?.tsrc=rss

Automakers including Volkswagen AG (OTC: VLKAF) (OTC: VLKPF), Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F), and General Motors Co (NYSE: GM) resorted to production holidays to beat the crisis with strong possibilities of reduced production going forward. U.S. chip companies, including Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC), Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MU), and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD), reached out to President Biden for a possible solution. Incentives were promised to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTC: SSNLF) for a New York plant. Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ: APPL) major chip supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg Co Ltd (NYSE: TSM), is looking forward to a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona to come online by 2024. Reportedly, Wang met the local chip makers previously on the issue. “Going forward, manufacturers are doing what they should,” she said. The chip shortage has become a diplomatic issue as Germany’s economy minister has also written to Wang asking for help. TSM plans to raise its capital expenditure to $28 billion this year to resolve the crisis. Price action: TSM shares are down 1.47% at $134.64 in the pre-market session on the last check Monday.

2021-02-22	2021-02-22 04:33:57	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Global Scramble for Scarce Chip Supplies Drives Asia Growth	(Bloomberg) -- Global manufacturers’ scramble to get hold of scarce semiconductor supplies is driving faster growth in Asia.Demand for the chips used inside cars, touch screens, and work-from-home gear amid the pandemic fueled the biggest jump in South Korea’s early-month exports since late 2018, a report showed Monday. Taiwan’s government over the weekend said it sees 2021 economic growth being the fastest in seven years, thanks to the world’s appetite for semiconductors.The tech rally shows the global economy is gathering momentum after last year’s pandemic slump. It also speaks to growing worldwide dependence on two Asian powerhouses -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. -- for semiconductors, a reliance exacerbated by the pandemic and rising U.S.-China tensions even before the current global shortages.South Korea’s early exports increased 16.7% in the first 20 days of February from a year earlier, the customs office reported Monday. Average daily shipments increased by an even bigger margin because the period had fewer working days this year due to the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.“The exports add to indicators that show that the global economy is rebounding from its bottom,” said Park Chong-hoon, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Seoul. “There’s growing demand for tech products that are helping companies worldwide reshape themselves as they prepare for the end of the pandemic.”The report, closely watched as a barometer of global trade, indicates a recovery in overseas demand is well underway as vaccination drives pick up speed in major markets. The data also comes after Taiwan on Saturday more than doubled its forecast for export growth this year to 9.58% and raised its projection for the economy’s overall expansion.What Bloomberg Economics Says...“We expect the recovery in external demand to broaden as vaccines are rolled out and lockdowns are eased. Base effects from the onset of the pandemic last year may also boost the readings in the months ahead.”--Justin Jimenez, economistTo read the full report, click here.Some economists warn that chip sales could slow as the pandemic passes and demand for work-and-study from home solutions reverts to something closer to pre-virus days. Another issue would be to what extent the tech boom can benefit the broader economy and support employment, considering the industry’s highly-automated manufacturing base.“The so-called untact culture has so far helped drive chips, but there’s also a chance vaccinations and new spending by chipmakers may slow down the rally,” said Song Myung-sup, an analyst with Hi Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul, referring to a term used in Korea to describe technologies that help people maintain social distance. Still, Song forecasts the chip shortage to deepen at least until the end of the first half.The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeThe world’s reliance on TSMC and Samsung Electronics comes amid a growing cost and sophistication of advanced chipmaking. As Taiwan’s biggest company, TSMC’s net income grew 50% in 2020 -- its speediest pace of expansion in a decade. Samsung Electronics is projected to chalk up its fastest pace of revenue growth since 2018 during the March quarter. South Korea is also home to SK Hynix Inc., another giant memory-chip maker.Overseas sales of Korea’s semiconductors jumped 27.5% in the first 20 days of February as a worsening shortfall accelerated orders and pushed up the prices of chips.Such momentum in exports contrasts with deteriorating economic conditions at home with the unemployment rate jumping to the highest in more than two decades in January. The Bank of Korea is expected to consider the uneven recovery as its board convenes this week for a rate decision.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-scramble-scarce-chip-supplies-043357136.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-21	2021-02-21 12:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Chip Crisis Flummoxes Congress in a World Where U.S. Output Lags	(Bloomberg) -- Lawmakers hoping to revitalize U.S. semiconductor manufacturing in response to a global chip shortage will find it tough to do in the near term, even if Congress throws billions in cash subsidies at the problem.There’s bipartisan support for increasing domestic chip manufacturing capacity with some U.S. carmakers forced to idle plants as supply chains are interrupted by the global pandemic. That would make it a relatively easy political sell to include in President Joe Biden‘s infrastructure package, currently being drafted with a focus on creating jobs.But desire and money aren’t enough to jump-start an industry. The U.S. still leads the world in chip design, but manufacturing has largely been ceded to foreign firms. The few companies that do make chips domestically, including Intel Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc., don’t currently have the capacity or execution track record to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., according to analysts.Even China, which has invested billions of dollars in expanding its capacity, has little to show for it so far, according to Anand Srinivasan, a senior semiconductor analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.“It’s not for lack of trying. They put a lot of money into it and they are not competitive at all. That’s the risk here,” he said.The chip shortage is expected to wipe out $61 billion of sales for automakers as production is stalled for want of the complex pieces of silicon. And the fallout now threatens to hit the much larger electronics industry.Congress sees an opening to address the issue by creating tax incentives and supplying billions of dollars in federal grants as incentives for building semiconductor plants, called fabs, in the U.S. Advocates say approving subsidies as part of a broader infrastructure package could prevent the next shortage, even if it won’t do much to help the current one.That could help U.S. companies become less reliant on a handful of foreign suppliers, and avoid supply disruptions from trade disputes or outside forces, such as the pandemic. It would also lessen the national-security risk for chips used in defense technology or government systems. And it could create scores of high-paying advanced manufacturing jobs.The Semiconductor Industry Association is pushing for Congress to green-light tens of billions of dollars in the upcoming infrastructure bill, said David Isaacs, vice president of government affairs at the trade group. Those subsidies could offset the higher cost of producing the chips in the U.S. Sustained InvestmentBuilding chip plants is expensive and will require sustained investment. Semiconductor fabs making the most advanced chips can take as long as three years to build and cost roughly $10 billion each, according to Srinivasan.A substantial taxpayer investment would pay off, the chip industry says. Approving $50 billion of incentives would mean the U.S. could capture 25% of the new global manufacturing capacity, compared to 6% without federal help, according to a Boston Consulting Group study funded by SIA. The U.S. would be the second most attractive place to build a fab, next to China, the report said, and it could mean as many as 19 new facilities, creating 70,000 high paying jobs.Bipartisan groups in Congress have been pushing grant programs and tax credit incentives. They think they have a good shot this year in the infrastructure bill that will become Biden’s top priority after another round of virus relief passes next month.Texas Representative Michael McCaul, top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has spoken to the White House about the need for semiconductor manufacturing subsidies, and was well received, according to one committee aide.“The Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly shown it has no problem weaponizing its control of the supply chain to benefit themselves and to punish their perceived enemies,” McCaul said. “We absolutely cannot let that happen with semiconductors.”Senators John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, and Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, are leading the effort in the Senate. Cornyn joined bipartisan senators in a Feb. 2 letter to National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, urging the administration to act on the global shortage and secure funding to implement the semiconductor provisions approved in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, also signed the letter.“This shortage threatens our post-pandemic economic recovery, the consequences of which stand to be especially acute in dominant auto manufacturing states,” the senators wrote.Warner, in an emailed statement, said without efforts to boost manufacturing, the U.S. is at risk from “serious supply chain and security vulnerabilities, while giving an advantage to our adversaries across the globe, who aren’t taking their foot off the pedal in this arena.”China CompetitionBiden administration officials have identified semiconductors as a strategic area for domestic investment to compete with China. The president is expected to sign an executive order in coming weeks calling for a supply chain review for critical goods, including semiconductors.The defense bill enacted in December authorized the use of federal incentives to promote semiconductor manufacturing and research in the U.S., but the bill didn’t include funding for the grants and tax credits lawmakers say is necessary to attract investment.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung are both considering building manufacturing plants in the U.S. TSMC announced plans to build a fab in Arizona worth $12 billion -- if it can arrange enough subsidies at the state and federal level. Samsung is considering spending more than $10 billion to build its most advanced logic chip-making plant in Austin, Texas, but plans aren’t final.“If you’re TSMC or one of the big foundries, the U.S. government is going to have to make it worth your while,” said Vivek Arya, a technology analyst with BofA Securities Inc. “Just because it is important to regional security, doesn’t mean it is a profitable endeavor.”Europe, the U.S., China and Japan are all pushing for chip manufacturers to build cutting-edge factories within their borders, and semiconductor manufacturers aren’t going to create more production capacity than there is demand for, Arya said. Asia has a leg up because the electronics manufacturing supply chain is localized there, he added.The U.S has increasingly fallen behind on chip-making, even as semiconductors have become more integral to the economy as a critical part of technologies ranging from cars to artificial intelligence, according to Stephen Ezell, head of global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. The U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity fell to 12% in 2020 from 37% in 1990, according to SIA data.An ITIF report shows the U.S. offers relatively few research and development subsidies compared to other countries -- ranking 24th out of 34 among major economies. China’s incentives are roughly 2.7 times more generous that those offered in the U.S., according to the report.And U.S. incentives are about to get cut back. A change embedded in the 2017 Republican tax law set to take effect in 2022 shifts the accounting rules for the R&D credit, making the incentive about $40.1 billion less valuable next year, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation. The semiconductor industry says those benefits need to be preserved, and new incentives created, to level the playing field for the U.S.“This takes long-term investments and a structural commitment,” Arya said. “It cannot be caught up in politics and the budgeting process. That’s where this has fallen behind.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chip-crisis-flummoxes-congress-world-120000292.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-02-20	2021-02-20 18:34:56	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Chip Shortage Latest: Taiwan Says Semiconductor Makers On Top Of It, VW Labor Leader Says Golf Models Under Pressure	"A shortage of computer chips is causing automakers to scale back production and raising questions over supplies to other sectors such as consumer electronics. Here's the latest: ""Manufacturers are doing what they should,"" said Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua, as reported by Reuters. Taiwan, home to Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), is a major source of the world's chips. TSMC has almost a 56% market share among the world's chip foundries. Wang said on Saturday that she has met with companies in recent weeks and that she received a letter Friday night from the White House about the problem. ""We are helping as much as we can,"" she said. Foxconn, another Taiwanese company, also is trying to calm nerves. The Apple supplier's chairman, Liu Young-way, said on Saturday that the shortage will have only ""limited impact"" on Foxconn and its clients. ""Since most of the customers we serve are large customers, they all have proper precautionary planning,"" he said. A labor leader for Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) reportedly said the German automaker's biggest plant, in Wolfsburg, is facing shortages of semiconductors and also battery cells. This is making it hard to meet demand for Golf models, including hybrids. The shortage has hit automakers hardest as sales rebound from pandemic lockdowns faster than expected, at the same time that demand for electronic devices shot up and the effects of the pandemic hit supply chains.

2021-02-18	2021-02-18 07:12:27	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Biden Team Pressing Taiwan, Allies on Auto Chip Shortfall	(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s top economic adviser, Brian Deese, has sought the Taiwanese government’s help resolving a global semiconductor shortage that’s idling U.S. car manufacturing plants, according to a letter reviewed by Bloomberg News.In the letter, Deese thanked Taiwan’s minister of economic affairs, Wang Mei-hua, for her personal engagement on the microchips shortage and relayed concerns from U.S. automotive companies.Deese’s letter shows that top White House officials have become involved in trying to resolve the shortage, which has presented an early challenge to Biden’s administration. Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, as well as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are both personally engaged in the effort to address bottlenecks in auto companies’ supply chains, a White House spokesperson said.The spokesperson asked not to be identified by name because the talks have been private. Wang told reporters Thursday that she hasn’t received a letter from Deese and reiterated that Taiwan’s chipmakers are trying to resolve the supply constraints.The administration is engaging with international partners and allies to encourage them to take steps to address the shortage, but all sides recognize it’s not a short-term crisis, the White House spokesperson said. More will have to be done to prevent similar shortages in the future, the spokesperson added.The World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here’s Why: QuickTakeTaiwan is home to the largest semiconductor manufacturing industry in the world, and also relies on U.S. weapons to defend against China, which views the island as part of its territory and has threatened to use force if Taipei moves toward formal independence.The Biden administration has also asked U.S. embassies around the world to identify how foreign countries and companies that produce chips can help address the global shortage and to map the steps taken to date, the spokesperson said.‘Reasonable’ AsksThe formal outreach to Taiwan follows meetings between Deese and Sullivan and U.S. auto companies and their suppliers. The auto industry is leaning on the White House to pressure foreign chipmakers and their governments to allocate supplies to the U.S.“We think those are reasonable things for the government to ask,” said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which lobbies for Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles). “This is going to be a problem for the first half of the year.”Administration officials in the State and Commerce departments have previously sought meetings with Taiwanese government and industry officials to press them to ramp up the supply of semiconductors.Thousands of American autoworkers could face cuts to their hours and wages as plants halt production while awaiting new shipments of automotive-grade semiconductors from Taiwan and South Korea -- chips that won’t even be manufactured for three to four months. Companies have provided the White House with the job impact data, people familiar with the matter said.That prospect threatens to undermine Biden’s efforts to energize a sputtering economic recovery, hitting hardest in political battleground Michigan, as well as Texas and Kentucky.IHS Markit estimated this week that nearly 1 million fewer light vehicles will be produced in the first quarter of 2021 because of the semiconductor shortage. The projection was a revision of an earlier estimate of 672,000 fewer cars coming off production lines in the first quarter that was issued by the group on Jan. 29.The chip shortage first hit the auto industry in December, coinciding with a tumultuous transition of power, an impeachment trial, the ongoing pandemic and the urgent push for an economic stimulus. By the time Biden was sworn in, former President Donald Trump’s administration had only made preliminary efforts to fix the problem.Senior Biden administration officials have identified semiconductors as one of the strategic areas for domestic investment to compete with China and ensure the U.S. is no longer dependent on other countries. Biden plans to sign an executive order in the coming weeks to demand a review of supply chains, though no imminent action is expected to result from it.Taiwan DependenceLeaders across the globe are realizing just how dependent they’ve become on the island democracy of Taiwan, which is being courted for its capacity to make leading-edge computer chips. That’s mostly due to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest foundry and go-to producer of chips for Apple Inc. smartphones, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.Taiwan’s role in the global economy was largely below the radar before the auto industry suffered shortfalls in chips used for everything from parking sensors to reducing emissions. With carmakers including Germany’s Volkswagen AG, Ford and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. forced to halt production and idle plants, Taiwan’s importance has suddenly become too big to ignore.But there’s a question about how effective cooperation can be in a time when every allied country wants to move away from its dependence on China and build their own capacity at home.U.S., European and Japanese automakers are lobbying their governments for help, with Taiwan and TSMC being asked to step in. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the potential for shortages last year and agreed on the need to accelerate Europe’s push to develop its own chip industry, according to a French official with knowledge of the matter.Exacerbating the U.S. shortages, power failures caused by brutally cold weather in Texas have shuttered semiconductor plants clustered around Austin.NXP Semiconductor NV, one of the largest makers of chips used by auto companies, has idled two plants in the Austin area, the company said early Wednesday. Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s second largest semiconductor maker, also closed down production at its Austin site, the South Korean company said. Infineon Technologies AG, another large supplier of chips to the automotive industry, said its Austin plant has been shut down because the power was turned off.(Updates with comment from Taiwan minister in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-aide-deese-asks-taiwan-024937610.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-11	2021-02-11 20:15:20	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Qualcomm CEO Elect Says Huawei Ban May Help With Chip Shortages	(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc.’s incoming Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon said U.S. sanctions against China’s Huawei Technologies Co. may help alleviate a global shortfall in semiconductor supply.If Huawei’s in-house chip unit HiSilicon can’t get its designs manufactured, the company may order more chips from other providers. These limitations will also free up capacity at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Amon said in a webcast with Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall.Automakers and some other companies have complained that output is being hampered by shortages of some key components. Amon said Qualcomm, whose chips are at the heart of most high-end smartphones, had experienced much higher-than-expected demand.A sharp rebound in demand for products that depend on chips, such as personal computers, home networking gear and vehicles, has created tightness in supply. That surge will tail off in some sectors in the second half of the year, he said.Amon cautioned that any supply freed up by fewer HiSilicon orders at TSMC won’t translate into an immediate up-tick in output for other providers. That’s partly because it takes time transfer chip designs being made elsewhere, he said.Any resolution of the trade war between the U.S. and China will take time and it’s likely that the semiconductor part of this dispute will be the most time consuming section of any agreement, the incoming CEO said.Qualcomm is not allowed to supply Huawei currently but is open to working with handset maker Honor, which spun off from the Chinese tech giant recently. In the meantime, Qualcomm is providing chips to Huawei rivals in China which are gaining smartphone market share, Amon said.Separately, Qualcomm welcomes efforts to bring more chip manufacturing back to the U.S. The building of U.S. plants by TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. would help Qualcomm. The company would would also consider giving production orders to Intel Corp. if that company decided to open its factories to outsourced manufacturing, Amon said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-ceo-elect-says-huawei-201520404.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-02-11	2021-02-11 18:34:17	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Biden Team Pledges Aggressive Steps to Address Chip Shortage	(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration is working to address the global semiconductor shortage that has caused production halts in U.S. industries including autos, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.The administration is identifying choke points in supply chains and discussing an immediate path forward with businesses and trading partners, Psaki told reporters at the White House on Thursday. In the longer term, policy makers are looking for a comprehensive strategy to avoid bottlenecks and other issues the semiconductor industry has been facing for years.President Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order directing a government-wide supply chain review for critical goods in the coming weeks, with the chip shortage a central concern behind the probe.The order will compel a 100-day review led by the National Economic Council and National Security Council focused on semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging, critical minerals, medical supplies and high-capacity batteries, such as those used in electric vehicles, two people familiar with the draft said.Additional supply-chain assessments are expected within a year, focused on critical products -- materials, technology and infrastructure -- and other materials tied to defense, public health, telecommunications, energy and transportation.U.S. Chip Industry Urges Biden to Support Domestic ProductionOn Thursday, chief executive officers of chip companies including Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. wrote the president, urging him to support domestic production and stop the country from losing its edge in innovation.The executives, who sit on the board of the Semiconductor Industry Association, asked Biden to include “substantial funding for incentives for semiconductor manufacturing, in the form of grants and/or tax credits” in his recovery and infrastructure plans.The letter, signed by 21 CEOs including Bob Swan of Intel, Steve Mollenkopf of Qualcomm and Lisa Su of AMD highlighted that the country’s global share of chip manufacturing has dropped to 12% from 37% in 1990.Read more: Biden Plans Supply Chain Review After Virus Caused ShortagesU.S. companies mostly outsource production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co.

2021-02-08	2021-02-08 01:31:36	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Chip Shortage Spirals Beyond Cars to Phones and Consoles	(Bloomberg) -- The first hints of trouble emerged in the spring of 2020. The world was in the early throes of a mysterious pandemic, which first obliterated demand then super-charged internet and mobile computing when economies regained their footing. That about-face -- in a span of months -- laid the seeds for potentially the most serious shortage in years of the semiconductors that lie at the heart of everything from smartphones to cars and TVs.Auto and electronics makers that cut back drastically in the early days of the outbreak are now rushing to re-up orders, only to get turned away because chipmakers are stretched to the max supplying smartphone giants like Apple Inc. This week, Qualcomm Inc.’s Cristiano Amon, head of the world’s largest mobile chipmaker, flagged shortages “across the board,” citing the industry’s reliance on just a handful of players in Asia.Amon joined a growing chorus of industry leaders warning in recent weeks they can’t get enough chips to make their products. Carmakers appear in direst straits and have spurred the U.S. and German governments to come to their aid -- General Motors Co. this month was forced to mothball three North American plants and Ford Motor Co. is bracing for a 20% drop in near-term output. But more industries have lately copped to shortages, emphasizing how Covid-19 and a boom in a new breed of 5G-ready smartphones like the iPhone 12 is exacerbating a shortage of capacity plaguing the entire consumer industry. Chip shortages are expected to wipe out $61 billion of sales for automakers alone, but the hit to the much larger electronics industry -- while tough to quantify at this early stage -- could be far larger.Apple, a major Qualcomm customer, said recently that sales of some new high-end iPhones were hemmed in by a shortage of components. Europe’s NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG -- whose roles near the top of the supply chain grant them visibility over global chip flows -- have both indicated the constraints are no longer confined to autos. And Sony Corp. said Wednesday it might be unable to fully sate demand for its new gaming console in 2021 because of production bottlenecks.“The virus pandemic, social distancing in factories, and soaring competition from tablets, laptops and electric cars are causing some of the toughest conditions for smartphone component supply in many years,” said Neil Mawston, an analyst with Strategy Analytics. He estimates prices for key smartphone components including chipsets and displays have risen as much as 15% in the past three to six months.Read more: A Year of Poor Planning Led to Carmakers’ Massive Chip ShortagePC makers were among the first to hint, in the spring of 2020, at an impending crunch, a warning echoed by Lenovo Group Ltd. on Wednesday. At the heart of the crisis sits Taiwan and its largest company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the chipmaker of choice to the world’s technology and auto giants. It spent billions in past years ensuring it remains at the forefront of semiconductor production technology -- a costly exercise that’s both paid off and also thrust it into the middle of a global geopolitical dogfight.On Friday, Qualcomm and Corning Inc. joined Biden administration officials to discuss the gathering storm with their Taiwanese counterparts and the island’s top industry representatives including TSMC. Both sides repeatedly stressed their interdependence, Taiwan’s Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-Hua told reporters. The presence of several senior U.S. officials and the Semiconductor Industry Association -- which represents America’s biggest chipmakers -- emphasized the urgency of the situation.The current crisis stems from several factors that converged last year. Like most every chip designer on the planet, Qualcomm outsources production to Asian companies, foremost among which are TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. The pair are increasingly the only recourse for producing the most advanced semiconductors. But their capacity takes years to plan and billions of dollars to build in tandem with customers, and the post-Covid 5G phone and internet boom took their clients by surprise.Read more: The World Is Dangerously Dependent on Taiwan for SemiconductorsIndustry executives also blame excessive stockpiling, which began over the summer when Huawei Technologies Co. -- a major smartphone and networking gear maker -- began hoarding components to ensure its survival from crippling U.S. sanctions. Led by Huawei, Chinese imports of chips of all kinds climbed to almost $380 billion in 2020 -- making up almost a fifth of the country’s overall imports for the year.Rivals including Apple, worried about their own caches, responded in kind. At the same time, the stay-at-home era spurred sales of home appliances from the costliest TVs to the lowliest air purifiers, all of which now come with smart, customized chips. TSMC executives said on its two most recent earnings calls that customers have been accumulating more inventory than normal to hedge against uncertainties, a maneuver they see persisting for some time.“There’s a chip stockpiling arms race,” said Will Bright, co-founder and chief product officer at Drop, which uses custom chips in headphones and keyboards.All that has dried up the spigot for smaller-volume buyers such as the makers of cars and gaming consoles: Nintendo Co., Sony and Microsoft Corp. have struggled to make enough Switches, PlayStations and Xboxes for about a year. The game hardware industry is bracing for supply to get worse before it gets better in 2021, potentially even affecting the next holiday season, people familiar with the matter say.It didn’t help that automakers -- the most visible cohort to be affected -- misjudged the situation. Some industry observers blame their predicament on near-sighted planning and under-estimation of a post-Covid rebound in auto demand. Others argue chipmakers are prioritizing higher-volume and more lucrative consumer electronics such as smartphones.On Friday, Minebea Mitsumi Inc. -- a vital supplier to the transport and electronics industries -- suggested shortages may plague even more sectors, including aviation. “Demand is springing up everywhere at a faster-than-expected pace,” CEO Yoshihisa Kainuma told analysts on a call. “Airlines around the world are scrapping old aircraft to slim down their balance sheet. And people’s desire to travel will explode after the pandemic.”It’s anybody’s guess when production will catch up with demand. But a growing number of industry observers don’t see quick or simple resolution.“A lot of it can be traced back to the second quarter of last year, when the whole world basically shut down. Many auto companies shut down manufacturing and their suppliers re-prioritized,” said Mario Morales, an analyst with IDC. “Not until the second half will we see relief for some of these markets.”(Updates with chart after eighth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chip-shortage-spirals-beyond-cars-200059989.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-04	2021-02-04 00:53:24	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Qualcomm Warning Shows Semiconductor Shortages Are Spreading	(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc., the world’s largest smartphone chipmaker, warned it is struggling to meet demand, signaling that a global semiconductor shortage is spreading.“The shortage in the semiconductor industry is across the board,” said incoming Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon.Like most chipmakers, Qualcomm outsources production to companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. These suppliers are trying and so far failing to adjust to a vigorous rebound in demand. The auto sector has complained about this recently, but Qualcomm’s comments show the problems are broader.When the Covid-19 pandemic first struck in early 2020, chip orders initially collapsed. But remote work and studying has spurred demand for computers, while car buying has surged as people avoid public transport. That, in turn, has caused auto and electronics makers to re-up their chip purchases.Amon said orders for chips that run computers, cars and many other internet-connected devices are swamping the industry, which mostly relies on just a handful of factories in Asia. Supply should improve in the second half of 2021, he added.Qualcomm shares fell about 6% in extended trading. The stock closed at $162.30 on Wednesday in New York, leaving it up 6.5% in 2021.The company also reported quarterly results on Wednesday and gave an upbeat forecast. However, that didn’t satisfy some analysts and investors who have become more bullish on Qualcomm recently.Outgoing CEO Steve Mollenkopf said Qualcomm’s performance was curbed by supply constraints.Apple Inc., a major Qualcomm customer, said last week that sales of high-end iPhone 12 models were limited by the availability of some components. Earlier on Wednesday, General Motors Co. warned that a global semiconductor shortage will reduce production this year as the carmaker plans downtime at three plants.Qualcomm is the biggest maker of chips that connect smartphones to wireless networks and also supplies processors that give the devices their computer-like capabilities. With customers including Apple and Samsung, the company’s projections are a closely watched indicator of the health of the mobile phone market.In its fiscal first quarter, Qualcomm said revenue was $8.24 billion, a gain of 62% from a year earlier. Analysts, on average, projected $8.25 billion. Net income was $2.12 a share. Excluding certain items, profit was $2.17 a share, compared with Wall Street’s average estimate of $2.09.Last month, Qualcomm said Amon will succeed Mollenkopf, who will retire in June.(Updates with CEO comments in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-gives-upbeat-sales-forecast-210119912.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-02-03	2021-02-03 10:18:47	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	China Stockpiles Chips, Chip-Making Machines to Resist U.S.	(Bloomberg) -- China is taking decisive steps to protect itself from a widening U.S. technology ban, with imports of computer chips and the machines that make them surging last year.Chinese businesses bought almost $32 billion of equipment used to produce computer chips from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere, a 20% jump from 2019, a Bloomberg analysis of official trade data shows.And with companies like Huawei Technologies Co. stockpiling supplies ahead of U.S. sanctions, imports of computer chips climbed to almost $380 billion -- making up about 18% of all of China’s imports for the year.The U.S. has steadily restricted Chinese firms’ access to American technology, pushing Beijing to redouble efforts to develop a domestic chip industry after years of slow progress. The Trump administration’s actions exposed China’s vulnerability in this key sector -- and even with President Joe Biden now in office, Beijing is pushing ahead with a sweeping new plan to become self-sufficient in semiconductors.“In the near term, China is dependent on imports to advance its semiconductor manufacturing,” said Dan Wang, a technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics in Shanghai. “China does not yet have the capability to produce the advanced chipmaking equipment it needs. The country is investing heavily, but success will require more than a decade-long effort.”Chinese companies like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. have ramped up their purchases of the machines needed to make silicon wafers and computer chips. China became the largest market for such equipment in 2020, according to a December report from SEMI, an industry association.With Huawei and other tech companies stockpiling chips ahead of U.S. restrictions, imports surged about 14% in 2020. Huawei was blacklisted by the U.S. government, preventing it from buying the chips and other components from American suppliers it needs for smartphones and communications equipment. The Trump administration tightened rules even further to stop any company that uses American gear from supplying Huawei.China’s chip purchases also soared because of strong global demand for computers and work-from-home technology during the pandemic. A large portion of chips imported by China are assembled into devices from smartphones to laptops and then exported.One of the big winners of that surge in chip demand was Taiwan, with orders at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. and other firms climbing and Taiwan’s economic growth outpacing China’s for the first time in 30 years. Soaring demand also contributed to global shortages of chips for carmakers, forcing some auto plants to halt production.Demand should continue to increase this year, with the Semiconductor Industry Association forecasting in December that global chip sales would gain 8.4% this year, continuing to benefit firms like TSMC, Intel Corp., and Samsung Electronics Co. Chinese firms also will continue to buy equipment as they seek to produce more of their own semiconductors, likely helping the sales of companies like Tokyo Electron Ltd. and ASML Holding NV.“We expect that China will take a more balanced approach in chipsets imports, sourcing high-end chipsets that China is not able to manufacture for now from global vendors,” said Charlie Dai, a technology analyst at Forrester Research Inc. “China will also strategically make investment to accelerate the localization of high-end chipset manufacturing, which is all about addressing the geopolitical challenge.”Whether this bonanza for foreign technology companies lasts will depend on China’s success and pace in developing a self-sufficient semiconductor industry.The government will announce details of its five-year economic strategy in March, and has already cited self-reliance in technology as a national strategic goal. Central to that is China being able to manufacture its own chips and reduce reliance on foreign know-how. That, in turn, could see foreign companies losing their share of the Chinese market and domestic competitors becoming stronger.(Updates with analyst’s comment in 11th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-stockpiles-chips-chip-making-210000407.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-29	2021-01-29 08:44:39	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	U.S. to Press Taiwan, TSMC to Resolve Auto Chip Crunch	(Bloomberg) -- Biden administration officials have called an ad-hoc meeting next week with Taiwan government and industry officials, during which they’re expected to pressure Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and its peers to ramp up the supply of vital chips to American automakers.The virtual conference scheduled for Thursday U.S. time would be the most high-profile meeting between newly appointed Biden administration officials and their counterparts from Taipei. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matt Murray and Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce Richard Steffens are scheduled to confer with Taiwan Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua, people familiar with the matter said. Executives from the island’s largest chipmakers including TSMC and MediaTek Inc. will also attend a discussion centered on resolving a global shortage of auto chips, they said.The meeting is intended to forge closer ties between the two sides, the ministry said in a statement to Bloomberg News, without elaborating on the agenda or final attendance list. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing Friday he wasn’t aware of the meeting, but reiterated that Beijing “opposes official interactions between the U.S. and China’s Taiwan region.”Global carmakers such as General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. face potentially $61 billion of lost revenue for the year because they can’t secure enough of the chips that go into a plethora of vehicle parts. TSMC and other Taiwanese firms are among the world’s most sophisticated chipmakers and produce a significant portion of the semiconductors for everything from cars to laptops.Read more: A Year of Poor Planning Led to Carmakers’ Massive Chip ShortageThis week, TSMC vowed to reallocate capacity to support the global automotive industry. Some industry observers say the shortage stemmed from near-sighted planning and under-estimation of a post-Covid rebound in automobile demand, while others argue chipmakers are prioritizing higher-volume and more lucrative consumer electronics such as smartphones.The quagmire reveals the risks for automakers like Ford and Volkswagen AG as vehicles become smarter and technologically more complex. Carmakers with more software and chip expertise are set to face a smoother ride, while those whose traditional strength in metal-bending are potentially more prone to supply hiccups.The people familiar with the meeting details asked not to be identified talking about a private arrangement that has yet to be made public. A spokesperson for the U.S. State department declined to comment. Representatives for the U.S. Commerce Department, TSMC and MediaTek didn’t respond to requests for comment.“We continue to engage with government officials as this remains a critical issue,” said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, the lobbyist for the Detroit-based automakers GM and Ford as well as the U.S. operations of Stellantis NV (formerly Fiat Chrysler). “We are grateful for the Biden administration’s ongoing assistance and hope it can continue as more key positions are filled.”The meeting will take place as Biden’s administration signals strong backing for an island China claims as its own. The U.S. State Department this week urged China to engage in a dialogue with Taiwan and halt military pressure on the island, in an early nod of support for Taipei.Disputes over Taiwan, which has been one of the biggest flash points between the U.S. and China since the Cold War, have returned to the fore as Washington steps up support for Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.Read more: U.S. Urges China to Talk With Taiwan in Early Nod From Biden(Updates with China’s response in the third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-press-taiwan-tsmc-resolve-084439412.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-28	2021-01-28 13:00:05	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Samsung Net Profit Misses Estimates After 5G iPhone’s Debut	(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. missed analyst estimates for the fourth quarter and warned profitability will likely decline this quarter, citing weakness in its memory chip business and challenges with currency fluctuations.South Korea’s biggest company reported net income in the three months ended December of 6.45 trillion won ($5.84 billion), missing the 7.3 trillion won average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Shares fell 2.2% in Seoul on Thursday.Samsung, the world’s largest maker of memory chips and displays, struck a cautious tone that stood in contrast to that of many technology companies benefiting during the coronavirus lockdowns. Just hours earlier, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. reported financial results that handily exceed estimates.“In the first quarter, we expect overall profitability to decline due to relative weakness in the memory and display businesses,” said Ben Suh, executive vice president of investor relations, during a call with investors. In the memory business, Samsung’s most important profit engine, “results are likely to weaken due to currency effects and continued costs associated with new fab ramp up.”Operating profit for the semiconductor unit was 3.85 trillion won in the fourth quarter, short of the 4.62 trillion estimate from analysts. The company said it expects a recovery in the business in the first half.Samsung said it’s tracking whether chip shortages that have hit the global auto industry could spill over to other sectors, including tech products.“This is a global issue,” said Han Jinman, executive vice president of the memory business. “There is a possibility that the shortage of other semiconductor parts may impact mobile demand and so, we are carefully watching how that plays out.”In the smartphone business, Samsung struggled in the holiday period as Apple introduced its first 5G-capable iPhones and Chinese rivals put up fierce competition. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company took over the No. 1 position in the fourth quarter, ahead of Samsung and China’s Xiaomi Corp., market research firms said on Thursday.With a lot of good devices on the market, “there is only so much that Samsung can grab out of it,” said Kiranjeet Kaur, research manager at IDC.Investors had anticipated Samsung could increase its dividend payout substantially, in part because the founding Lee family faces an enormous inheritance tax bill. Instead, the company said it would continue to return 50% of free cash flow to shareholders between 2021 and 2023, although its annual dividend payout will increase slightly to 9.8 trillion won.The results come just days after Samsung’s de-facto leader, billionaire heir Jay Y. Lee, was sent back to prison on bribery charges. Although professional managers lead the company’s operating units, Lee has played a central role in major strategic decisions.The company signaled it will continue to press ahead with critical deals and investments. Samsung will use its capital to expand the capacity of its foundry business, which fabricates chips for clients like Nvidia Corp., to meet demand and overcome current supply shortages. It will also invest in facility expansions and “meaningful” acquisitions, the company said.“For the last few years, we have been evaluating possible M&A opportunities very carefully and have made significant progress in terms of preparation,” Choi Yoon-ho, chief financial officer of Samsung, said during the earnings call. “Although it is difficult to pinpoint a specific timing due to uncertainties in the internal and external business environment ... we are optimistic of carrying out meaningful M&A activities during this term.”Read more: Samsung Surges to New High on Strong Memory Market OutlookAnalysts including Yungsan Choi of Ebest Investment & Securities have been anticipating a long-awaited rebound in memory chip prices due to demand for servers and more powerful 5G smartphones. Component supplier Murata Manufacturing Co. and chipmaker MediaTek Inc. both anticipate more than half a billion 5G handsets to be shipped this year.Chipmakers Intel Corp. and Micron Technology Inc. gave a bullish forecast for the first quarter of this year on continued demand for computers and phones that enable working and studying from home. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is planning another record-breaking year of investment with as much as $28 billion set aside to expand and improve its production capacity at a time of silicon supply shortages affecting everyone from global automakers to mobile tech giants like Apple and Qualcomm Inc.Samsung’s contract chip manufacturing is expected to expand with the addition of Intel as a customer. The two companies have discussed development and production of Intel’s mainboard chipsets over the last two years and Samsung will produce the chipset at its Austin, Texas plant starting from this quarter, Meritz Securities said in a note.Samsung Is Said to Mull $10 Billion Texas Chipmaking PlantThe existing Austin fab is capable of operating on a 14-nanometer process. With rising expectations of growth in the foundry market, Samsung is considering building a cutting-edge logic chipmaking plant in the region that would be capable of fabricating chips as advanced as 3nm in the future, Bloomberg News reported earlier.“Regarding investments including building a fab in the U.S., we haven’t made a decision yet,” said Shawn Han, senior vice president. “Due to the nature of foundry business that requires timely and efficient responses to customers’ demand, we routinely review capacity expansions. We continue to study ways to optimize operations at fabs in all regions from Giheung, Hwaseong to Austin.”(Updates with executive comment on shortages in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-net-profit-misses-estimates-001526522.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-27	2021-01-27 01:33:25	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	AMD Gives Upbeat Sales Forecast on Demand for Chips	(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave an upbeat forecast, reflecting strong demand for its chips and gains against rival Intel Corp.First-quarter revenue will be about $3.2 billion, plus or minus $100 million, Santa Clara, California-based AMD said Tuesday. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $2.73 billion. For 2021, the company projected a sales increase of 37%, well ahead of Wall Street expectations.AMD has struggled for decades to make sustainable gains against Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker. However, the smaller company has revamped its products and outsourced production, helping it create processors that match or exceed the performance of Intel’s offerings. That has spurred early market share gains and a surge in AMD shares in recent years.Lisa Su, AMD’s chief executive officer, faced questions on whether she can get enough chips to meet demand and how much more profitable the company could be if it can pull this off.“Overall demand has been high in 2020 and exceeded our plans,” she said in an interview. “All of our businesses are firing on all cylinders.”AMD’s 2021 forecast takes into account tight supply in the first half of the year. Profitability is increasing and margin expansion will depend on which market is growing faster, she said. AMD’s profit margins aren’t being squeezed higher production costs or price cuts, she added.In addition to competing with Intel in processors for personal computers and servers, AMD supplies graphics chips used in Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox and Sony Corp.’s PlayStation. New versions of these video game consoles went on sale during the recent holiday period, raising expectations for this part of AMD’s business, which rivals Nvidia Corp.AMD’s chips are made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has better production technology than Intel. TSMC also supplies Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Nvidia and many other technology companies, and the Taiwanese company is struggling to keep up with demand.Last week, Intel reported better-than-expected earnings and gave an upbeat forecast for the first quarter. Strong demand for laptops to support working and studying from home has fueled growth and will continue in the first half of 2021, Intel said.AMD reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.78 billion, or $1.45 a share, compared with $170 million, or 15 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 53% to $3.2 billion. Profit, excluding certain items, was 52 cents. Analysts were looking for profit of 47 cents on sales of $3 billion. Net income was boosted by a tax benefit of $1.3 billion in the quarter, AMD said.AMD shares slipped about 1% in extended trading. The stock has soared almost 90% in the past year.(Updates with CEO comments in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-gives-upbeat-sales-forecast-213506337.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-25	2021-01-25 21:06:20	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	The World Is Dangerously Dependent on Taiwan for Semiconductors	(Bloomberg) -- As China pushes the world to avoid official dealings with Taiwan, leaders across the globe are realizing just how dependent they’ve become on the island democracy.Taiwan, which China regards as a province, is being courted for its capacity to make leading-edge computer chips. That’s mostly down to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest foundry and go-to producer of chips for Apple Inc. smartphones, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.Taiwan’s role in the world economy largely existed below the radar, until it came to recent prominence as the auto industry suffered shortfalls in chips used for everything from parking sensors to reducing emissions. With carmakers including Germany’s Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. of the U.S. and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. forced to halt production and idle plants, Taiwan’s importance has suddenly become too big to ignore.U.S., European and Japanese automakers are lobbying their governments for help, with Taiwan and TSMC being asked to step in. Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron discussed the potential for shortages last year and agreed on the need to accelerate Europe’s push to develop its own chip industry, according to a French official with knowledge of the matter.The auto industry’s pleas illustrate how TSMC’s chip-making skills have handed Taiwan political and economic leverage in a world where technology is being enlisted in the great power rivalry between the U.S. and China -- a standoff unlikely to ease under the administration of Joe Biden.Taiwan’s grip on the semiconductor business -- despite being under constant threat of invasion by Beijing -- also represents a choke point in the global supply chain that’s giving new urgency to plans from Tokyo to Washington and Beijing to increase self-reliance.By dominating the U.S.-developed model of outsourcing chip manufacture, Taiwan “is potentially the most critical single point of failure in the entire semiconductor value chain,” said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of the technology and geopolitics project at Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung. The Trump administration exploited that pinch point to deny Beijing access to technology. By banning access to all U.S. chip technology including design, it was able to cut off the supply of semiconductors from TSMC and other foundries to Huawei Technologies, hobbling the advance of China’s biggest tech company.It also negotiated with TSMC to establish a $12 billion chip fabrication plant in Arizona. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. is set to follow, with a $10 billion facility in Austin, Texas.The “CHIPS for America Act” introduced to Congress last year aims to encourage more plants to be established in the U.S. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, plans to reintroduce the bipartisan bill this year with a view to securing $25 billion in federal funds and tax incentives. McCaul said in a statement he’s working with colleagues in the House and Senate “to prioritize getting the remaining provisions of CHIPS signed into law as quickly as possible.”News that Intel Corp., the onetime industry leader, was considering outsourcing production of some chips to TSMC under its former CEO underscored the need for a U.S. player that can fabricate at the leading edge, said a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee staff who is not authorized to speak publicly.The European Union aims to bolster the bloc’s “technological sovereignty” through an alliance armed initially with as much as 30 billion euros ($36 billion) of public-private investment to raise Europe’s share of the global chip market to 20% (without a target date) from less than 10% now.It’s also encouraging Taiwan to increase investments in the 27-nation bloc, with some success. GlobalWafers Co. -- based in TSMC’s hometown of Hsinchu -- just boosted its offer for Germany’s Siltronic AG to value the company at 4.4 billion euros, an acquisition that would create the world’s largest silicon wafer maker by revenue.That’s not to say Taiwan is the only player in the semiconductor supply chain. The U.S. still holds dominant positions, notably in chip design and electronic software tools; ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands has a monopoly on the machines needed to fabricate the best chips; Japan is a key supplier of equipment, chemicals and wafers.But as the emphasis shifts to ever smaller, more powerful chips that require less energy, TSMC is increasingly in a field of its own. And it’s helped Taiwan form a comprehensive ecosystem around it: ASE Technology Holding is the world’s top chip assembler, while MediaTek has become the largest smartphone chipset vendor.Tokyo, too, is attempting to attract TSMC to set up in Japan. With 110 billion yen ($1 billion) earmarked last year for R&D investment and another 90 billion yen for 2021, some of that may go to a TSMC facility, which reports have said the company is considering setting up in Japan.“TSMC is becoming more and more dominant,” said Kazumi Nishikawa, an official working on technology issues at Japan’s Economy Ministry. “This is something everybody in the chip industry must find a way to deal with.”China, in its five-year plan presented in October, is channeling help to the chip industry and other key technologies to the tune of $1.4 trillion through 2025. Yet even that kind of money doesn’t negate the need for Taiwan. Indeed, China has long tapped the island for chip-making talent; two key executives at China’s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., used to work at TSMC: co-Chief Executive Officer Liang Mong Song and Vice Chairman Chiang Shang-yi.But with Washington stymieing China’s progress, there is also speculation that Beijing could resort to stealing chip IP, with Taiwan at the heart of those endeavors.Taiwanese cyber security firm TeamT5 has observed a steady increase in attacks on the island’s chip industry corresponding to the tightening of U.S. export controls on China. While it’s not always possible to know if these are Chinese state actors, “they are all attacking the Taiwanese semiconductor industry,” Shui Lee, a T5 cyber threat analyst, said.Fellow analyst Linda Kuo said the Taiwanese government was alarmed by a ransomware attack on TSMC in 2018 and had announced plans for some $500 million to help the industry become more aware of cyber security issues.The greater worry is that TSMC’s chip factories could become collateral damage if China were to make good on threats to invade Taiwan if it moves toward independence.TSMC's capital spending of as much as $28 billion for this year suggests it's going to stay out in front.“Taiwan is the center of gravity of Chinese security policy,” said Mathieu Duchatel, director of the Asia program at the Institut Montaigne in Paris. Yet while Taiwan’s status in the global chip supply chain is a “huge strategic value,” it’s also a powerful reason for Beijing to stay away, said Duchatel, who’s just published a policy paper on China’s push for semiconductors.Assuming Taiwanese forces were to be overwhelmed during an invasion, “there is no reason why they would leave these facilities intact,” he said. And preserving the world’s most advanced fabs “is in the interests of everyone.”For all the moves to reel back domestic chip fabrication, it’s optimistic to think the supply chain for such a complex product as semiconductors could change in short order, Peter Wennink, ASML chief executive officer, told Bloomberg TV. “If you want to reallocate semiconductor build capacity, manufacturing capacity, you have to think in years,” he said.In the meantime, geopolitics means chip shortages could become a more regular occurrence, according to Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China.“This is going to move on to the point where actually because of export controls, because of governmental intervention, there will be all of a sudden supply chain disruptions not just because of capacity problems,” he told Bloomberg Television. “So better get prepared.” For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-dangerously-dependent-taiwan-semiconductors-210620534.html?.tsrc=rss
2021-01-25	2021-01-25 16:13:56	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC Slips Amid Report That Samsung Plans To Build A Chip Foundry	Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) dropped 3.7% on Jan. 22 after Bloomberg reported that its competitor Samsung is planning to build a chip-making foundry in the US. According to the report, Samsung is looking at investing more than $10 billion to build the chip-making foundry in Austin, Texas. Construction is expected to start this year and operations could begin in 2023. Over the next decade, Samsung is planning to invest $116 billion in its chip fabrication and foundry business, according to the Bloomberg report. The report about Samsung’s plans comes after TSMC (TSM) in May last year, had announced plans to build a foundry in Arizona using its 5-nanometer technology for wafer fabrication. The chipmaker had said that it expected to spend $12 billion on this foundry from 2021 to 2029. (See TSM stock analysis on TipRanks) TSMC’s 5-nanometer technology wafers are extensively used in HPC (High-Performance Computing Platforms) and smartphones. According to TSMC’s latest fourth-quarter results released this month, its smartphones segment generated 50% of its revenue followed by HPC, which generated 31% of sales. Furthermore, TSMC said that it expects to ramp up its capex from $17.2 billion in FY20 to a range of $25- $28 billion for FY21. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini, who has a Sell rating and a $74 price target on TSM stock on Jan. 22 commented on the report regarding Samsung and what it could mean for TSMC. Hosseini said, “We find Bloomberg’s article, highlighting Samsung’s intention to build a new leading edge fab in Austin, TX, is consistent with our commentary following TSM’s earnings report and guide. We noted then that part of TSM’s massive capex guide of $25-$28bn is because of increased competition from Samsung and certainly not because of outsourcing of MPUs [microprocessing units]. Bloomberg’s article, in our view, underscores this increased competitive threat.” Overall, analysts are cautiously optimistic about the stock. The Moderate Buy consensus is based on 3 Buys and Hosseini’s Sell. The average price target of $111.50 implies 13.7% downside potential to current levels.

2021-01-22	2021-01-22 20:56:12	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel CEO’s New Crusade Pits Investors Against U.S. Interests	(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp.’s new Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger wants the company to regain its former glory as the world’s leading chip manufacturer and he says it’s a strategic priority for the U.S.That pits the industry veteran against investors and analysts who are hankering for quick results and think Intel’s bottom line takes precedence.“This is a national asset. This company needs to be healthy for the technology industry, for technology in America,” Gelsinger told analysts late Thursday after pledging to keep most of Intel’s semiconductor production in-house. “It’s an opportunity to help and to unquestionably put Intel and the United States in the technology leadership position.”The stock dropped 9% in New York Friday, its worst day since October, on concern a manufacturing turnaround will take years and cost billions of extra dollars. Some investors had advocated for Intel to outsource more production before Gelsinger revealed his hand.“Catching up is both a long shot and long journey,” Jefferies LLC analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a note titled “U.S. Semi Manufacturing Crusade = No Quick Turnaround.”Intel will struggle to live up to Gelsinger’s assertion that the company can catch and pass Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the current leader in chip production. However, his rallying cry resonates more with other audiences and may bring Intel allies in the new administration of U.S. President Joe Biden.The chip industry is at the heart of a growing national rivalry between China and the U.S. China is the biggest consumer of semiconductors and the government there has vowed to spend more than $160 billion to create a domestic semiconductor sector. So far, though, it still relies heavily on U.S. chipmakers.That equation has become more complicated amid increasing scrutiny of the global technology supply chain. While many U.S. companies still design advanced chips, they have them made by TSMC in Taiwan.Intel is one of the few remaining chip companies that supply themselves with leading manufacturing. And it still makes many chips in the U.S., with factories in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico. These components power computers that run or design government encrypted communication, nuclear power plants, military hardware and banking systems.If Intel outsourced production to TSMC -- as some on Wall Street want -- the U.S. would lose a major advanced manufacturing sector and hand more crucial know-how to Taiwan, a country China calls a rogue province that is only 100 miles off the coast of the mainland.Some U.S. lawmakers have begun listening to Intel and other U.S. chip industry players who have argued for years that incentives to keep manufacturing in the country just aren’t enough compared with what’s offered in China and other parts of the world.Last year, a bipartisan bill to provide $50 billion of incentives to build production in the U.S. was proposed. But to put that seemingly staggering amount of money into perspective, earlier this month TSMC said it’s planning to spend as much as $28 billion on new plants and equipment this year.Read more: Chip Industry Wants $50 Billion to Keep Manufacturing in U.S.“What we’ve heard from the U.S. government is, we need access to advanced microelectronics technology and manufacturing here in the U.S.,” Intel’s outgoing CEO Bob Swan told analysts late Thursday. “We need a safe and secure supply chain increasingly here in the U.S.”While improving its own manufacturing, Intel could develop a technology partnership with TSMC and other major operators of chip foundries. TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. are either working on or considering new factories in the U.S.Read more: Samsung Mulls $10 Billion Texas Plant“This type of a partnership could also leverage new U.S. tax credits for onshore manufacturing for further value creation,” Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at UBS, wrote in a note to investors on Friday.Last year, Biden proposed a 10% “Made in America” tax credit covering projects such as increasing domestic production and retooling or expanding manufacturing facilities.Even U.S. government spending power won’t quickly fix Intel’s main problem: The sheer difficulty of making chips. The tiny squares of silicon are home to billions of tiny switches or transistors. Intel factories in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico churn out millions of these semiconductors a month. But doing that reliably has become increasingly difficult and TSMC has forged ahead by gaining more experience as the biggest maker of smartphone chips.Semiconductors made using Intel’s latest production technology, called 7-nanometer, won’t arrive until 2023, executives said late Thursday. The TSMC equivalent has been used by Apple to mass produce chips for the iPhone for about a year already.“Even if Intel does successfully execute on 7-nanometer, they are still a node behind TSMC,” said Raymond James analyst Chris Caso. “And we don’t think Intel can deliver leadership products without leadership in transistors because it has never been done before. That keeps Intel behind the industry for four more years.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-ceo-crusade-pits-investors-205612479.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-22	2021-01-22 16:49:19	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Samsung Considers $10 Billion Texas Chipmaking Plant, Sources Say	(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. is considering spending more than $10 billion building its most advanced logic chipmaking plant in the U.S., a major investment it hopes will win more American clients and help it catch up with industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.The world’s largest memory chip and smartphone maker is in discussions to locate a facility in Austin, Texas, capable of fabricating chips as advanced as 3 nanometers in the future, people familiar with the matter said. Plans are preliminary and subject to change but for now the aim is to kick off construction this year, install major equipment from 2022, then begin operations as early as 2023, they said. While the investment amount could fluctuate, Samsung’s plans would mean upwards of $10 billion to bankroll the project, one of the people said.Samsung is taking advantage of a concerted U.S. government effort to counter China’s rising economic prowess and lure back home some of the advanced manufacturing that over the past decades has gravitated toward Asia. The hope is that such production bases in the U.S. will galvanize local businesses and support American industry and chip design. Intel Corp.’s troubles ramping up on technology and its potential reliance in the future on TSMC and Samsung for at least some of its chipmaking only underscored the extent to which Asian giants have forged ahead in recent years.The envisioned plant will be its first in the U.S. to use extreme ultraviolet lithography, the standard for next-generation silicon, the people said, asking not to be identified talking about internal deliberations. Asked about plans for a U.S. facility, Samsung said in an email no decision has yet been made.“If Samsung really wants to realize its goal to become the top chipmaker by 2030, it needs massive investment in the U.S. to catch up with TSMC,” said Greg Roh, senior vice president at HMC Securities. “TSMC is likely to keep making progress in process nodes to 3nm at its Arizona plant and Samsung may do the same. One challenging task is to secure EUV equipment now, when Hynix and Micron are also seeking to purchase the machines.”Read more: Intel Talks With TSMC, Samsung to Outsource Some Chip ProductionIf Samsung goes ahead, it would effectively go head-to-head on American soil with TSMC, which is on track to build its own $12 billion chip plant in Arizona by 2024. Samsung is trying to catch TSMC in the so-called foundry business of making chips for the world’s corporations -- a particularly pivotal capability given a deepening shortage of semiconductors in recent weeks.Under Samsung family scion Jay Y. Lee, the company has said it wants to be the biggest player in the $400 billion chip industry. It plans to invest $116 billion into its foundry and chip design businesses over the next decade, aiming to catch TSMC by offering chips made using 3-nanometer technology in 2022.It already dominates the market for memory chips and is trying to increase its presence in the more profitable market for logic devices, such as the processors that run smartphones and computers. It already counts Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp. as customers, companies that historically relied on TSMC exclusively. It has two EUV plants, one near its main chip site in Hwaseong, south of Seoul, and another coming online nearby at Pyeongtaek.To close a deal, Samsung may need time to negotiate potential incentives with U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration. The company has hired people in Washington D.C. to lobby on behalf of the deal and is ready to go ahead with the new administration in place, the people said. Tax benefits and subsidies will ease Samsung’s financial burden, but the company may go ahead even without major incentives, one of the people said.Samsung has been looking into overseas chipmaking for years. Intensifying trade tensions between the U.S. and China and now Covid-19 are stoking uncertainty over the reliability and economics of the global supply chain. Plants in the U.S. could help the Korean chipmaker strike better deals with key clients in the U.S., particularly in competition with TSMC.From Microsoft Corp. to Amazon.com Inc. and Google, the world’s largest cloud computing firms are increasingly designing their own silicon to power their vast data centers more efficiently. All need manufacturers like TSMC or Samsung to turn their blueprints into reality.Samsung’s U.S. branch purchased land in October next to its existing Austin fab, which is capable of running older processes. The Austin City Council held a meeting in December to discuss Samsung’s request to rezone that parcel of land for industrial development, according to meeting minutes.The Korean company’s existing Texas facility is too small to to meet increasing orders for outsourced chips coming from Qualcomm, Intel and Tesla, according to research by Citibank. Intel in particular is likely to funnel more orders toward Samsung to offset any reliance on TSMC for its foundry needs, the brokerage said in a report.Late Thursday, Intel’s incoming Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger told investors he was likely to keep most production of the company’s best processors in-house and that the delayed introduction of new manufacturing technology was showing signs of improving. Still, his comments disappointed some investors who have been lobbying for more outsourcing by the world’s largest chipmaker. Intel shares dropped as much as 9% in New York trading Friday, the most since October. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which relies on TSMC for production, gained as much as 4.8%.Read more: Samsung Intensifies Chip Wars With Bet It Can Catch TSMC by 2022Some analysts question Samsung’s ability to carve out a significant share of a market dominated by TSMC, which is spending a record $28 billion this year to ensure it remains at the forefront of technology and capacity. For its part, Samsung’s semiconductor division spent $26 billion on capital expenditure in 2020, but that’s been largely in support of its dominant memory business and not all of its expertise in making memory is directly relevant to creating advanced logic chips.Processors are more complex to manufacture than memory and their production yields are harder to control and scale up in the same way. Foundry customers also require bespoke solutions, imposing another barrier to rapid expansion and also making Samsung dependent on customers’ designs. But the Korean giant can draw confidence from its work with Nvidia, whose chief executive officer has sung Samsung’s praises in collaborating on the manufacturing for its latest graphics card silicon.(Updates with Intel plans in 14th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-considers-10-billion-texas-070408324.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-22	2021-01-22 15:44:18	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	7 Mega-Cap Stocks With Solid Foundations	When so many changes and challenges are happening all at once, there is always great opportunity and great risk. But what we’re seeing in the market now is that a new class of stocks — mega-cap stocks — has been created that capitalizes on both. They are the new market titans, but they are also the stocks that investors turn to when times get worrisome. Generally, once “new rules” get set in the market, a correction comes along and resets the rules back to the long-term standard. And before I utter the words, “it’s different this time,” I will simply say that these stocks represent some of the most widely held stocks in the world. They are held by institutions and individuals alike on such a massive scale it’s hard to imagine any of them falling off a cliff. Now, they may have tough times, as some already have, but these seven mega-cap stocks with solid foundations are long-term stocks that will continue to deliver come what may.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day Each and every stock on this list has either an “A” or “B” rating in Portfolio Grader. Let’s take a look: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Mega-Cap Stocks: Apple (AAPL) Source: pio3 / Shutterstock.com At the beginning of August 2018, AAPL was the first stock to break the $1 trillion market capitalization ceiling. That was pretty amazing. You know what is even more amazing? It only took two years before it was the first stock to break the $2 trillion market cap ceiling. That is some incredible growth. And in that time, the company didn’t do much differently than it usually does, upgrading products and shuffling its product line. It didn’t launch a new line of products or move into a new sector. It simply became a stock that everyone wanted for both growth and safety. Apple represents the best of big tech but is also well established — the perfect long-term stock. And the talk about moving into electric or self-driving vehicles is pretty exciting stuff for the decade ahead. In the past year this behemoth is up a whopping 73% and still has a dividend that is better than most bank certificates of deposit (CDs). Amazon (AMZN) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com There are two things that founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has developed that have launched Amazon into the stratosphere of mega-cap stocks and made it one of the most reliable long-term stocks in the market — a focus on customers and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The former was there from the very beginning. When the company was young and faced off against Barnes & Noble, the biggest bookseller in the world at the time, Bezos told his small crew to worry about the customers, not the competition. And after building a thriving book business and moving into consumer goods, Bezos and his engineers built a massive database that turned into the most successful cloud-computing businesses in the world. 7 Dividend Stocks That Are Growing Their Payouts With a $1.66 trillion market cap, AMZN continues its expansion. And so does the stock, up 75% in the past 12 months. PayPal (PYPL) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Launched by super-investors Elon Musk, Peter Theil, Musk’s brother and a handful of others, PYPL is one of the forefathers of the fintech movement. And it continues to expand its horizons today, even after the founders have moved on to new ventures. The launch of peer-to-peer (P2P) payments platform Venmo wasn’t fully embraced when it started, but now it has spread like wildfire and is one of the dominant P2P payment platforms in the world. At this point, PYPL would be a big fish to swallow by a big financial or tech firm, but it could do some interesting joint ventures or even buy a bank and get into a broader range of traditional bank offerings. That’s a trend in fintech now, and a merger of equals could be interesting. The stock is up 113% in the past 12 months. It’s not exactly cheap, but it has some really exciting long-term prospects to boost its growth. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com One long-term trend sped up last year — the adoption of the digital economy. Between lockdowns and self-imposed isolation, reaching out was done more with electronic devices than in-person interactions. It’s no surprise then that chipmakers had a very good 2020. And that isn’t over. These are long-term stocks that will continue to grow, because we’re not going back to a less digital world when the pandemic is over. There are chips in everything now, from toaster ovens to earbuds. Server farms are getting bigger as the demand for cloud computing and 5G telecom expands. And the largest chipmaking foundry in the world is TSM. You can name almost any major fabless semiconductor maker and it is a client of TSM, including AAPL and NVDA in this article. The 7 Best Stocks To Buy In The Dow Jones Today The stock is up 123% in the past year, yet it’s still trading at a P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) of 36. Microsoft (MSFT) Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com Next on my list of mega-cap stocks, with a $1.5+ trillion market cap, is Microsoft. It wasn’t that long ago that MSFT was teetering between prominence and afterthought. But no longer. It has built its own fast-growing, high-margin cloud-computing division, created its own line of industry standard computers and leveraged its world-renowned software applications. And it now stands as one of the premier long-term tech stocks on the planet. The dominance that Apple displays within its closed garden, MSFT has in the open world beyond the AAPL world. And even there, the two titans have come to a grudging realization that they both need each other for continued growth and support. The crazy thing is, for all the power and promise that MSFT has, it hasn’t risen as quickly as other big tech in the past year — it’s “only” up 37%. It also has a reliable 1% dividend. NVIDIA (NVDA) Source: Allmy / Shutterstock.com Graphic processing units (GPUs) were a pretty niche market for a long time. Gamers would pay up for high-performance GPUs, as would research facilities and IT departments in tech-dependent firms. But it wasn’t a major growth sector. And that was good news for NVDA, which dominated the niche. And when it blew up with more digital commerce and mobility, the company was the biggest game in town. As server farms grew to supply big data, cloud computing, 5G and the internet of things, NVIDIA was supplying the chips to run the machines that kept everything buzzing along. That also includes the bitcoin boom. At this point, this GPU firm continues to set the industry standards for performance and quality. Certainly, there are competitors, but NVDA has proven it can deliver time after time. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon The stock is up 120% in the past year and will continue to be one of top long-term tech stocks in the market. Walmart (WMT) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com After all these sexy big-tech stocks, the world’s largest retailer seems like an oddity on this list of mega-cap stocks. However, it has been WMT’s adoption of tech that has kept it relevant, especially in the past few years. As one of the leading “big-box retailers” there was a significant threat to its business model when the pandemic hit. But WMT had already seen the power of online retail and the threat that AMZN posed if the company didn’t make an effort to develop its own robust e-commerce presence. That has helped keep Walmart a powerhouse. In 2019, the company racked up $340 billion in retail sales. Amazon had $112 billion. AMZN still has a strong lead in online sales (about 38% vs. 5%), but people are shopping again. And they get value for their money when they shop at Walmart. The stock is up just 26% in the past 12 months, is well valued and delivers a solid 1.5% dividend.

2021-01-22	2021-01-22 14:42:07	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Tumbles After New CEO Recommits to Chip Manufacturing	(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. shares tumbled after the incoming chief executive officer pledged to regain the company’s lead in chip manufacturing, countering growing calls from some investors to shed that part of its business.“I am confident that the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally,” Pat Gelsinger said on a conference call to discuss financial results. “At the same time, given the breadth of our portfolio, it’s likely that we will expand our use of external foundries for certain technologies and products.”He plans to provide more details after officially taking over the CEO role Feb. 15, however Gelsinger was clear that Intel is sticking with its once-mighty manufacturing operation.“We’re not just interested in closing gaps,” he told analysts on a conference call Thursday. “We’re interested in resuming that position as the unquestioned leader in process technology.”Keeping production in-house may be bad for Intel because its manufacturing technology has fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for many of Intel’s rivals. If the U.S. company can’t catch up, its products will become less competitive and it could lose sales and market share.Intel shares fell 5.7%% at 9:36 a.m. in New York on Friday. They have declined about 6% over the last 12 months compared with a 16% increase in the S&P 500.Activist Dan Loeb has suggested the company consider spinning off its manufacturing business. Other investors have been waiting to see if Intel will outsource more production.“Where investors are going to be disappointed is that some were expecting some sort of larger announcement of a strategic partnership with TSMC,” said Edward Jones & Co. analyst Logan Purk.TSMC recently announced capital spending of as much as $28 billion for 2021 to maintain its lead. Purk said Intel would have to increase its own spending massively to try to catch the Asian company.TSMC dropped 3.6%, the most since March 23. Shares of some Intel suppliers also dropped, with Screen Holdings Co. down 3.7% and Tokyo Electron Ltd. declined 1.6%.Read More: Intel Probes Potential Unauthorized Access to Earnings ReportGelsinger is taking the reins of a company in the midst of its worst crisis in at least a decade. It has been the largest chipmaker for most of the past 30 years, dominating the $400 billion industry by making the best designs in its own cutting-edge factories. Most other U.S. chip companies shut or sold plants and tapped other firms to make the components. Intel held out, arguing that doing both improved each side of its operations and created better semiconductors.That strategy has crumbled in recent years as Intel struggled to introduce new production techniques on time. It is now lagging behind TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co., which make chips for Intel competitors, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and big Intel customers including Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.AMD shares rallied in extended trading while Gelsinger discussed his goal of improving Intel’s in-house manufacturing.Intel’s quarterly results, released before the market closed on Thursday, initially sent the shares higher. A hacker accessed sensitive information from Intel’s website, prompting the company to report the numbers earlier than planned.Revenue in the period ending in March will be about $17.5 billion, the Santa Clara, California-based company said. This excludes the memory chip division Intel is selling. Analysts were looking for $16.2 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Intel sees strong demand for laptops through the first half of the year, Chief Financial Officer George Davis said in an interview. Earnings in the second part of the year will partly depend on whether corporations increase spending on new hardware, he added.“The question is will we see support from enterprise,” he said. “They’ve been very quiet.”Intel’s personal computer chip division had revenue of $10.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts expected $9.72 billion. Its higher-margin data center unit generated sales of $6.1 billion. Wall Street was looking for $5.37 billion.In Intel’s data center business, revenue from cloud service providers fell 15% from a year earlier. Enterprise and government sales slumped 25%. Volumes and average selling prices declined. Owners of large data centers are working their way through unused stockpiles of chips.In its PC business, Intel reported a 30% surge in laptop chip sales, even as average selling prices declined 15%.Fourth-quarter profit, excluding some items, was $1.52 a share on $20 billion of revenue, down 1% from a year earlier. Analysts had estimated $1.11 a share on revenue of $17.5 billion.Intel’s gross margin, the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of production, was 56.8%. This is a key indicator of the strength of its manufacturing and product pricing. Intel has historically delivered margins of about 60%.(Updates with shares in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-gives-upbeat-forecast-demand-210518064.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-21	2021-01-21 11:30:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Outsourcing Clues Mount Ahead of Earnings Under New CEO	(Bloomberg) -- Investors want to know one thing when Intel Corp. reports results Thursday: Will the world’s largest chipmaker outsource more production? We may already have an answer, judging by recent comments from other parts of the industry.On Tuesday, ASML Holdings NV, a key provider of chipmaking equipment, said it is shifting orders for some of its most advanced machines from one customer to others. It didn’t say who, but the company was likely referring to orders moving from Intel to other chipmakers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co.These two companies produce semiconductors for others. If Intel were outsourcing more, it would need fewer ASML machines, while TSMC and Samsung would need more gear to handle the extra work.Intel will likely address its manufacturing strategy after it reports fourth-quarter results. Investors and analysts have criticized the company for falling behind and failing to deliver a concrete plan during previous earnings reports.“Beyond the financials, investors will be looking for more clarity on Intel’s long-term strategy and manufacturing game plan,” Christopher Rolland, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, wrote in a recent research note. “We would be encouraged if the plan included outsourcing of at least some of the core PC/server products.”Last week, TSMC dropped more clues. It unveiled plans to increase 2021 capital spending to as much as $28 billion, a record and a huge jump from $17.2 billion in 2020. That fueled speculation it’s putting capacity -- ASML machines and other gear -- in place to fill large orders from Intel.The Taiwanese company’s executives declined to comment on customers. However, Intel has talked with TSMC and Samsung about the Asian companies making some of its best chips, Bloomberg reported recently.Read more about Intel Talks With TSMC and Samsung here.TSMC and Samsung have production technology that’s now more advanced than Intel, which has always made its best products in-house and previously led the industry. Manufacturing is one of the key factors in making chips that can crunch information faster, store more data and use less electricity.Intel may not deliver its final answer on Thursday, though. The company just replaced Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan with former executive Pat Gelsinger, who will take over next month. Swan said he would announce whether to outsource production, and by how much, during the first quarter, but Gelsinger may need more time to develop his own strategy.While investors focus on Intel’s future plans, it has been racking up record earnings on demand for personal computers as large chunks of the population work and study from home. The increasing use of cloud services has also bolstered sales of its Xeon server chips, which are the heart of data centers run by companies such as Google and Amazon.com Inc.When it announced the appointment of Gelsinger, Intel said fourth-quarter earnings would exceed its forecasts and had made “strong progress’ on its latest manufacturing process, known as 7 nanometer. In July, Intel shares slumped 16% when the company warned this technology would be a year late.Analysts expect Intel revenue fell 13% in the fourth quarter to $17.5 billion and they see sales declining 18% year-over-year to $16.18 billion in the current period. For 2021, sales are projected to fall 7%, the first annual contraction since 2015, according to average analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-outsourcing-clues-mount-ahead-113000834.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-20	2021-01-20 12:36:59	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	ASML Beats Estimates, Grapples With Chip Supply Shortage	(Bloomberg) -- ASML Holding NV, a crucial supplier to Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, beat analyst expectations for the first quarter and is planning a significant share buyback in the first quarter, with U.S.-China tensions doing little to disrupt strong demand.Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink said ASML hasn’t shipped EUV machines to China because the request for an export license is still with the Dutch government. “There have been very deep, lengthy discussions between the Dutch, the European and the U.S. governments about the strategic nature of this technology. We don’t expect that the fundamental views of the U.S. towards China will change with the new administration. It is known that China is the big competitor.”ASML shares hit a record high in Amsterdam trading, rising as much as 4.1% to 457.85 euros.Key InsightsThe Dutch supplier of machines to make semiconductors expects revenue in the first quarter of 3.9 billion euros ($4.7 billion) to 4.1 billion euros, with a gross margin of as much as 51%, it said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts had expected sales of 3.52 billion euros and a gross margin of 49.3%.ASML is insulated from the pandemic-induced economic downturn as customers such as Intel Corp., Samsung and TSMC need its latest machines to make chips that are faster, cheaper and more efficient. Developments in artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and 5G wireless networks should support future demand.Still, the chip industry needs to deal with the global chip supply shortage that’s crippling automakers around the world, the CEO said.“This engine needs to start running again,” Wennink said in an interview with Bloomberg. “We start from an under-capacity view today. So we’ll just have to step up and ship more tools and more machines to get more semiconductor capacity out there.”In the fourth quarter, ASML shipped nine of its newest EUV machines and won orders for six EUV systems representing 1.1 billion euros. EUV machines are used to etch smaller circuits while increasing capacity and speed.The company expects total EUV system sales this year of 5.8 billion euros, 30% higher than 2020.“The build out of the digital infrastructure and the continued technology innovation is relevant to the consumer, automotive and industrial markets and drives demand across our entire product portfolio,” Wennink said.Market ReactionASML shares have risen 69% in the past 12 months, outpacing a 14% gain in the Stoxx Europe technology index.Get MoreASML kept its guidance for low double-digit revenue growth for 2021, and annual revenue at 15 billion euros to 24 billion euros through 2025.The Dutch company has repurchased 1.2 billion euros worth of shares under its 6 billion euro buyback program, running through 2022.(Updates with CEO comments from second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asml-beats-estimates-grapples-chip-123659059.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-19	2021-01-19 14:45:24	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	A Year of Poor Planning Led to Carmakers’ Massive Chip Shortage	(Bloomberg) -- Near-sighted planning, supply-chain complexities and a tradition of keeping inventories low caused the semiconductor shortage that is now forcing carmakers to idle production lines and straining their relationship with chip manufacturers.Seeds of the imbroglio were sown almost a year ago as the virus outbreak led to plunging car demand, prompting auto-chip companies to slash orders. But when they wanted to increase supply toward the end of 2020, they struggled to secure capacity at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and other contract chipmakers that were busy servicing a boom in demand for gadgets that help housebound consumers stay connected, according to people familiar with the situation.While publicly assuring the problem is solvable, in private the parties are pointing fingers. Chipmakers say car companies’ preference for low inventories hurt their planning, while auto and part manufacturers say the supply chain is thrown into disarray as semiconductor makers drag their feet. Automakers also contend chipmakers are prioritizing consumer electronics because those devices provide the bulk of their sales and profits. Chipmakers deny they are playing favorites. The quagmire reveals the risks for automakers from Ford Motor Co. to Volkswagen AG as vehicles become smarter and technologically more complex. Carmakers with more software and chip expertise are set to face a smoother ride, while those whose traditional strength is metal-bending are potentially more prone to supply hiccups.“Even if the OEMs say they didn’t over-correct, they may not have been thinking far enough ahead,” said Tor Hough, founder of Elm Analytics, a supply-chain research firm based in the Detroit area, referring to automakers, or original equipment manufacturers in industry parlance. “They’re also very wedded to ‘lean manufacturing’ -- so keeping low inventory to be more cost efficient.”Autos vs. SmartphonesCarmakers don’t deal directly with TSMC and other contract chipmakers. Instead, they work with auto-part suppliers like Robert Bosch GmbH and Continental AG, which in turn deal with automotive-chip designers including NXP Semiconductors NV and Infineon Technologies AG.While those two European chipmakers both make some parts in-house, they outsource a significant portion of production to TSMC and other foundries. It’s difficult for automotive-chip designers to get their orders prioritized by foundries because their volume is dwarfed by their consumer-electronics peers.Because of carmakers’ “just-in-time” manufacturing model, their suppliers worried about quick inventory buildups and canceled orders originally planned for foundries in the first half of 2020, the people said. At the same time, foundries began seeing a surge in demand for gadget chips after Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Chinese brands prepped an avalanche of 5G devices including the iPhone 12, which require as much as 40% more silicon content as 4G handsets.One contract chipmaker notified all its customers in the third quarter that it might be time for them to place more orders as it anticipated a rebound in demand, but automotive clients demurred and ended up being the last ones to seek more capacity, one of the people said.Appeal to GovernmentsTSMC’s automotive customers continued to decrease demand in the third quarter, and the chipmaker only began to see sudden recovery in automotive orders in the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said in an earnings call earlier this month. By contrast, makers of consumer electronics and other hardware quickly built up chip inventories above the usual seasonal level, and are continuing to do so as they fret about potential future supply disruptions.The shortage has been exacerbated by a lack of capacity at assemblers including ASE Technology Holding Co., a person familiar with the matter said. Chip assemblers like ASE represent the critical final stage in finishing and preparing a chip for use, but the company’s production expansion has been hindered by an equipment supplier’s tardiness in delivering new gear, the person said. A further squeeze to the global supply was caused by the Trump administration blacklisting China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. in December.Once European and U.S. carmakers realized they had a problem, they appealed to officials in Taiwan, home to TSMC and other leading foundries including United Microelectronics Corp., for assistance in stabilizing their chip supply.The American Automotive Policy Council, which represents major U.S. car companies, sought out the Taiwanese government for help, according to people familiar with the matter. In addition, General Motors Co. spoke to Taiwanese officials, and got them to help relay its request to TSMC, Bloomberg News has reported. The European Union has approached Taipei about the same issue, and Volkswagen has separately reached out as well, according to a person familiar with the matter.“We have requested that the U.S. government help us find a solution to the problem because it will diminish our production and have a negative impact on the U.S. economy until it’s resolved,” Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said in an interview.Scaling Back OutputBecause chip production requires a lead time of about three months, the impact will last throughout the first half and could bleed into the third quarter, Blunt said. His organization is working with the Biden administration on the issue, he said.Ford, Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co., VW and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV -- now a part of Stellantis NV -- are among global carmakers that have scaled back output due to a lack of chips required for a wide range of components, from brakes to windshield wipers.With vehicles adding entertainment and autonomous-driving features, the amount of chips required is increasing and the supply chain becoming more complex. A car from a premium brand can require more than 3,000 chips, and even if just one is missing, the vehicle won’t get completed.“There are more chips, more varieties of chips. It’s not one batch of chips that went bad and they’re struggling with recovering that one chip,” said Hough at Elm Analytics. “The ecosystem upstream of the OEMs stopped purchasing the chips they used in production as the manufacturing went down.”Another bottleneck lies with smaller automotive-chip designers which supply critical chips to the whole industry and depend entirely on foundries. They often lack bargaining power to secure timely production because of their modest sizes.While automotive supply-chain managers are adept at containing short-term crises like the explosion in the northern Chinese port of Tianjin in 2015, they tend to be slower in making bigger changes that would help them deal with potential long-term disruptions, Elm Analytics’ Hough said.Foundry Spending SurgeBosch, the German car-parts maker, said its chips supply has been significantly diminished because a chipmaker’s expansion and production increases were delayed by the pandemic. In an emailed statement, Bosch said it is in daily contact with suppliers and customers to mitigate the impact.The shortage may start to ease as TSMC boosts its spending to a staggering $28 billion for 2021, with the foundry pledging this month that automotive chips will be a priority. The company has begun to offer more capacity in recent days to at least one automotive chip designer, although the volume still isn’t enough to satisfy demand, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.The situation isn’t as devastating as last spring’s car-plant shutdown that spanned the globe, said Sig Huber, a consultant at Conway MacKenzie and a former head of purchasing at Fiat Chrysler.“This will be more sporadic, a plant here or a plant there, for a shorter period of time, as opposed to a full industry shutdown,” Huber said. “This will not have anywhere near the impact of the production losses we saw last year.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/poor-planning-led-carmakers-massive-144524916.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-18	2021-01-18 08:15:57	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Samsung Heir Sent Back to Prison for 30 Months in Bribery Case	(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. heir Jay Y. Lee was sentenced to 30 months in prison over bribery charges, a dramatic setback for the world’s biggest electronics company as it tries to move beyond a years-long scandal that inflamed outrage over the cozy relationships between government and business.The Seoul High Court first jailed Lee in 2017 after convicting the billionaire for his role in a corruption scandal that toppled former South Korean president Park Geun-hye. The Samsung Group’s de facto leader served a year in prison, but was released in February 2018 after his original five-year term was cut in half and suspended. The Supreme Court overturned that verdict and ordered a retrial in 2019. Monday’s sentencing, the result of that retrial, sends the top decision maker at the country’s most valuable company back to jail at a time of rising competition and global uncertainty.In the dispute, Lee, 52, was accused of offering horses and other payments to a friend of the former president to win support for his formal succession at the corporation. The Supreme Court upheld a 20-year prison term for Park last week, citing wide-ranging charges including bribery related to Samsung. Lee still faces a second prosecution related to succession.“This is shocking news for Samsung, but Samsung should wrap up this legal wrangling and move forward,” said Chae Yi-bai, a former South Korean lawmaker who has worked at a non-profit shareholder activist organization. “Since Lee already spent one year in prison, there will be one and a half years of a leadership vacuum.”Shares of Samsung Electronics fell 3.4% after the sentencing. An attorney for Lee called the decision “regrettable.” Samsung Electronics declined to comment on the outcome.Why Jail Threat Hangs Over Samsung Billionaire Again: QuickTakeAny void in leadership presents risks for the world’s largest producer of memory chips, smartphones and consumer appliances as it deals with the Covid-19 pandemic, tumultuous U.S.-China relations and intensifying competition in mobile devices and semiconductors. While Samsung’s daily business is run by an army of managers, Lee’s absence may stall or complicate larger investments or strategic longer-term moves. The executive has played an active role at the company, frequently joining government-related and public events after he was released from the prison.“A rocky road is ahead for Samsung with Lee in jail,” said Chung Sun-sup, chief executive officer of Seoul-based corporate-analysis firm Chaebul.com.Samsung is in the midst of several multi-billion-dollar bets that will be crucial to the future of its business. It’s pouring $116 billion into its next-generation chip business that includes fabricating silicon for external clients, betting it can close the gap on industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. It’s also investing heavily in fifth-generation wireless equipment, seeking to capitalize on the prohibitions against using gear from Huawei Technologies Co.Shin Se-don, an emeritus professor of economics at Sookmyung Women’s University, called the prison sentence “too excessive” and warned that there could be a backlash against the government, given the importance of the Samsung Group to the country.“Lee might be able to manage the company from the jail, but there will be some setback,” said Shin. “The jailing of Lee will give an emotional shock to the people. Samsung is a backbone of our economy and people will be upset about the result.”During the last hearing on Dec. 30, Lee read out a lengthy personal apology over the case -- reiterating pledges he first made in May -- stressing his effort to make Samsung great while pledging not to repeat past wrongdoings, and promising not to pass down power to his children. Lee’s ascension to the chairmanship of Samsung after his father’s death in October is likely to be delayed until he goes free.Separately, he faces another case related to the controversial merger between Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries in 2015, which includes allegations ranging from violation of capital markets law to a breach of duty. Lee will have to attend hearings in that case while serving his time in jail.(Updates with ex-lawmaker’s comment in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-billionaire-heir-ordered-back-053954279.html?.tsrc=rss

In addition, the Commerce Department indicated its intent to deny “a significant number of license requests for exports to Huawei,” according to an email obtained by the news agency. Representatives for Intel and the U.S. Commerce Department didn’t immediately respond to requests by Bloomberg News seeking comment.The latest move against Huawei is probably the Trump administration’s last strike to weaken the Chinese telecommunications giant and puts the spotlight on how the incoming Biden administration will approach the U.S.-China relationship. Asian chip stocks and Huawei suppliers including Samsung Electronics Co., Tokyo Electron Ltd., Advantest Corp. and Lasertec Corp. slid between 1% and 4% in early Monday trading.Intel was among a small group of companies that the U.S. government cleared to do business with Huawei, which it put on its so-called entity list of national security threats in May 2019. Trump administration sanctions have cut Huawei off from business-critical relationships with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which provided the Android software on hundreds of millions of Huawei smartphones, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for its cutting-edge chips.Huawei has relied on Intel much less, primarily for its servers and consumer laptop products. A representative for the Chinese company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Read more: Trump’s China Inc. Onslaught Leaves Key Decisions for BidenTrump has escalated his campaign to curb China’s technological rise as his term draws to a close. Xiaomi Corp., another smartphone and consumer electronics vendor, was among nine firms added to the U.S. Defense Department’s list of companies with alleged ties to the Chinese military, a move that will restrict U.S. investments in its securities. Other companies include state-owned planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, which is central to China’s goal of creating a narrow-body plane that can compete with Boeing Co. and Airbus SE.The profile of the companies targeted, including in the latest announcements on Thursday, is staggering. They include China’s three biggest telecom firms, its top chipmaker, its biggest social media and gaming players, its top two smartphone makers, its main deepwater energy explorer, its premier military aerospace contractor, its leading drone manufacturer and its primary commercial planemaker.While the scope of Trump’s unprecedented actions has roiled markets, the full reckoning of their impact largely hinges on President-elect Joe Biden.

2021-01-15	2021-01-15 04:25:17	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Chipmaking Tool Supplier Expects Demand Boom to Last Years	(Bloomberg) -- The global shortage for chips that’s shut down factory lines and fueled waiting lists for the hottest consumer electronics is showing no signs of abating and that’s good news for specialist suppliers like Tokyo Electron Ltd.The provider of semiconductor fabrication tools expects orders from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. to rise for years to come as those companies scale up their production to sate booming demand.“Demand is overwhelming as the supply of various components is going to tighten toward this year’s end and more investment to increase manufacturing capacity is likely,” Chief Executive Officer Toshiki Kawai said in an interview with Bloomberg News. His remarks came ahead of TSMC announcing it’s raised its capital expenditure to more than $25 billion this year, helping push up Tokyo Electron’s share price by as much as 5.7% on Friday to a record high.TSMC and Samsung are the leaders in adopting extreme ultraviolet lithography, the most advanced fabrication method that lets them reach smaller geometries like 5nm today and 3nm in 2022, unlocking more powerful and efficient chips. Tokyo Electron commands 100% of the business for photoresist coaters and developers used in factories deploying EUV technology, according to its CEO, so every new EUV machine that goes online adds to its bottom line.“I can confidently say there’s no cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturer in the world that has no Tokyo Electron machineries in their lines,” Kawai said. “More factory investment means more business for us.”Read more: Carmakers Crying Out for Chips Fuels Growth for GlobalfoundriesThe automotive industry, which had been among the hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, is showing signs of recovery, which have translated into a widespread chip shortage as smartphone makers like Apple Inc. and Samsung’s consumer division were already raising their orders. More advanced phones with 5G wireless technology require even more silicon, and capacitor supplier Murata Manufacturing Co. anticipates 500 million of those devices in the coming fiscal year.Read more: Apple Supplier Murata Expects Half Billion 5G Phones in New YearIntel Corp., the longtime leader in silicon technology, has also been in talks with TSMC and Samsung about outsourcing some of its business, adding to the urgency of investment and capacity expansion. Samsung has committed in excess of $100 billion over a decade to develop its semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and keep up with its Taiwanese rival.Kazuyoshi Saito, an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities, said Tokyo Electron’s tools for EUV lines require extremely precise manufacturing to shut out any dust, making these EUV-compatible machines expensive.“More adoption of the EUV technology benefits Tokyo Electron in terms of volumes and unit prices,” he said.Tokyo Electron’s Kawai said demand for the company’s products has long been on the rise due to an expected boom of 5G smartphones and autonomous driving, but the Covid-19 pandemic ignited demand elsewhere, including logistics, retail and drug discovery.“Our industry has become essential to people’s lives because all industries that serve those needs now require semiconductor chips to advance,” he said.SEMI, a U.S.-based industry association, estimated global sales of semiconductor equipment to have grown 16% in 2020 from a year ago to a record $68.9 billion and the figure is expected to rise again to $71.9 billion this year. Tokyo Electron projects its revenue will hit 2 trillion yen ($19.3 billion) in the fiscal year ending in March 2024 from 1.13 trillion yen in the year ended in March 2020.One possible disruption to Tokyo Electron’s momentum could come from ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, with several Chinese companies like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. now subject to sanctions and bans. Kawai said customers in China are as important as those in other regions, though his company will adhere to rules and restrictions set by the U.S. government.“We won’t provide our products to customers that the U.S. manufacturers can’t, because that would be a risk for us if we do,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chipmaking-tool-supplier-expects-demand-042517456.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-15	2021-01-15 01:30:03	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC’s $28 Billion Spending Blitz Ignites a Global Chip Rally	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. triggered a global chip stock rally after outlining plans to pour as much as $28 billion into capital spending this year, a staggering sum aimed at expanding its technological lead and constructing a plant in Arizona to serve key American customers.The envisioned spending spree sent chipmaking gear manufacturers surging from New York to Tokyo. Capital spending for 2021 is targeted at $25 billion to $28 billion, compared with $17.2 billion the previous year. About 80% of the outlay will be devoted to advanced processor technologies, suggesting TSMC anticipates a surge in business for cutting-edge chipmaking. Analysts expect Intel Corp., the world’s best-known chipmaker, to outsource manufacture to the likes of TSMC after a series of inhouse technology slip-ups.The sheer scale of TSMC’s envisioned budget -- more than half its projected revenue for the year -- underscores TSMC’s determination to maintain its dominance and supply its biggest American clients from Apple Inc. to Qualcomm Inc. At 52% of projected 2021 revenue, the chipmaker’s planned spending would be the sixth-highest among all companies with a value of more than $10 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The outlay may also ramp up pressure on Intel, whose budget for 2020 was roughly $14.5 billion.“The high capex guide is indicative of TSMC’s confidence in Intel’s outsourcing business,” Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a note. “TSMC’s track record also shows high capex always subsequently led to high growth.”The world’s largest contract chipmaker expects revenue of $12.7 billion to $13 billion this quarter, ahead of the $12.4 billion average of analyst estimates. That will power mid-teens sales growth this year, though that’s roughly half the pace of the increase in 2020.Net income in the quarter ended December climbed 23% to NT$142.8 billion ($5.1 billion), compared with the NT$137.2 billion average of analyst estimates, the chipmaker said Thursday. That contributed to a 50% increase in full-year profit, the speediest rate of expansion since 2010. Sales in the December quarter climbed 14% to a record NT$361.5 billion, according to previously disclosed monthly numbers, helped in part by robust demand for Apple’s new 5G iPhones.Read more: As Chip Rivals Struggle, TSMC Goes In for the Kill: Tim CulpanTSMC jumped as much as 5.6%, the most since July, to an all-time high in early Friday trade, extending a rally of more than 70% over the past year. Supplier Tokyo Electron Ltd. climbed more than 4%, while ASML Holding NV rose 5.9% on Thursday. Other semiconductor companies in the U.S. rallied on Thursday, with Applied Materials Inc. gaining almost 8% and Lam Research Corp up 6% in New York. Intel gained 4%.The fourth-quarter results revealed increasing contributions from TSMC’s most-advanced 5-nanometer process technology -- used to make Apple’s A14 chips. That accounted for about 20% of total revenue during the quarter, more than doubling its share from the previous three months, while 7nm represented 29%. By business segment, TSMC’s smartphone business contributed about 51% to revenue, while high-performance computing (HPC) was at 31%.As rivals like United Microelectronics Corp. fall behind and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. struggles with American sanctions, TSMC’s pivotal role is likely to expand in 2021. The company has been racing to meet demand from larger-volume electronics clients, exacerbating a severe shortage of automotive chips that’s forcing firms like Honda Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG to curtail production.TSMC said the automotive industry had been “soft” since 2018 and demand only started to recover in the fourth quarter. The company is working with its automotive customers to address the capacity supply issues, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said, though he didn’t elaborate when the bottlenecks that forced carmakers to cut production could be resolved.Read more: Missing Chips Snarl Car Production at Factories WorldwideExecutives didn’t address reports about potential orders from Intel on Thursday, saying that they don’t discuss specific customers. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker held talks with TSMC about making some of its best chips, people familiar have said, though it’s unclear whether the company may pivot after the appointment of Pat Gelsinger as its new CEO.“We believe Intel would not change its plans of CPU foundry outsourcing even with the CEO change,” Citigroup analysts wrote in a note, citing the time and costs associated with process qualification as well as the risk that U.S. chipmaker won’t get capacity from TSMC if it doesn’t book ahead. “In our view, Intel will be one of the major customers to first adopt 3nm for production. TSMC might start shipping 3nm wafers to Intel from early 3Q22.”Read more: Intel Talks With TSMC, Samsung to Outsource Some Chip ProductionConstruction on a planned $12 billion plant in the southwestern U.S. state of Arizona will begin this year, executives reiterated, without specifying how much of the planned budget for this year will be allocated to the project. The factory will be completed by 2024, with initial target output of 20,000 wafers per month, though the company envisions having a “mega scale production site” over the long term, Chairman Mark Liu said.Even as TSMC grows, foundries such as TSMC, UMC and Globalfoundries Inc. aren’t expanding fast enough to meet the pandemic-induced spike in demand for gadgets. Those bottlenecks snarled the flow of chips not just to cars, but also Xboxes and PlayStations and even certain iPhones. TSMC is by far the most advanced of the foundries responsible for making a significant portion of the world’s semiconductors, serving the likes of Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors NV, which also supply the mobile and auto industries.What Bloomberg Industries Says:TSMC’s $28 billion capital investment target for 2021 is 50% more than investors expected, and amounts to management’s strong vote of confidence in demand for smartphones and high-performance computing (HPC) chips over the next three years. The capital outlay target implies 2021 sales could leap to $56 billion, 4% higher than the $54 billion consensus expects, assuming 50% capital spending intensity.-- Charles Shum, analystClick here for the research(Adds analyst comments in fifth and 12th paragraph, latest share performance in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-spend-28-billion-2021-064820722.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-13	2021-01-13 21:45:23	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Goes Back to Roots With Gelsinger to Regain Chip Lead	(Bloomberg) -- Even after he left Intel Corp. in 2009, Pat Gelsinger couldn’t stop talking about the company he’d worked at since he was a teenager.When asked about the chipmaker, he would regale listeners with stories of how his mentor and former Intel boss Andy Grove had shaped him. Now, back as chief executive officer, Gelsinger has the chance to re-establish a leadership approach that made Intel the dominant chipmaker, while bringing lessons learned elsewhere to help the company recover from its biggest crisis in at least a decade.The 59 year-old rejoins as the company confronts rivals selling better products and big customers developing their own semiconductors. His main challenge is to fix Intel’s manufacturing stumbles, which former CEOs Bob Swan and Brian Krzanich failed to do.Unlike Swan, Gelsinger has the technical know-how and deep inside experience that he’ll need to pull off a turnaround at Intel. As a former chip designer, Gelsinger understands the complex engineering that goes into Intel products. And as the former CEO of VMware Inc., he has embraced a cloud-computing boom that is reshaping Intel’s most important market.“Gelsinger is a darling for investors and was in our conversations the most-wanted next CEO for Intel,” said Chris Caso, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates. “He is at the same time an outsider -- coming from a much smaller and agile organization which has been successful in the last couple of decades at creating a new ecosystem and set of industry standards with multiple fundamental innovations -- and an Intel veteran.” Intel shares jumped 8% and VMware fell 7% after the leadership change on Wednesday.Around 2006, Gelsinger was the leading technical voice communicating a new Intel strategy to bring chip designs or updated manufacturing technology to market every year -- a quicker pace than before. The need was pressing because rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. was catching up, gaining a quarter of the lucrative market for server chips, up from almost nothing a few years earlier.At the time, Gelsinger dubbed this new, relentless cadence of technical updates “Tick Tock.” The strategy worked, banishing AMD back to less than 1% share of the server chip market a few years later.A devout Christian who wrote a book about balancing faith, family and work, Gelsinger was molded by Intel. He joined the company in 1979 as an 18-year-old just out of technical college and went on to design part of Intel’s most important chip, the 8086, as he studied for a higher degree part time at Stanford University.He worked his way up the ranks in a company that developed leaders by moving candidates around to give them experience of multiple aspects of its operations. It was in his role as Intel’s first chief technical officer that he rose to prominence as a gifted evangelist for the company’s innovations and vision of where computing was headed.Like Grove was, Gelsinger is capable of doling out intimidating verbal lashings when he feels those reporting to him are trying to avoid a problem or are not giving him honest answers, according to people familiar with his style. He makes time for all levels of employees who come to him for advice, the people said.Gelsinger applies the same candid judgment to his own career. After he left Intel, he frequently pointed to technological decisions made under his watch that had gone awry and told people he was pushed out when it was made clear he was not in line for the top job.After leaving Intel in 2009, Gelsinger joined data-storage provider EMC Corp., where he became a candidate to replace CEO Joe Tucci, who planned to retire. Instead, Tucci opted to stay and Gelsinger ended up as CEO at VMware, which was majority owned by EMC at the time. When Dell Technologies Inc. bought EMC, it also gained that company’s ownership of VMware.At VMware, Gelsinger faced twin challenges. The market for its main product, software that lets multiple workloads run on a single server, was maturing. Meanwhile, the company’s relationship with Dell was in constant flux through a series of reorganizations.Trying to fire up stalled growth, Gelsinger came up with several strategies before settling on a plan that closely allied his company with Amazon.com Inc.’s leading cloud service. The internet giant cooperated with VMware to win customers who wanted to run applications in the cloud while keeping their own corporate data centers operating with VMware software.After slumping during the first part of Gelsinger’s tenure, VMware’s shares have soared since early 2016 as revenue growth recovered.Regaining the trust of leading cloud providers such as Amazon and Google will be a key task for Gelsinger as head of Intel. Those companies, among the biggest buyers of Intel’s pricey server chips, are increasingly designing their own semiconductors and having them manufactured elsewhere. Delays in the introduction of new, faster chips by Intel have contributed to that migration.Microsoft Corp. is working on in-house processor designs for use in server computers that run the company’s cloud services, Bloomberg has reported. Apple Inc. is also replacing Intel chips with its own silicon for Mac computers.Read more: Apple Launches New Macs to Kick Off Switch From IntelThe biggest challenge for Gelsinger, though, will be to decide on Intel’s manufacturing future. When he left, Intel’s plants had the most advanced production in the industry by combining in-house designs tightly with new manufacturing processes. Now, the company has fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which doesn’t design its own chips, but makes them for most of Intel’s rivals.Read more: Intel Chipmaking Throne Challenged by Taiwanese UpstartSwan, the outgoing CEO, was considering outsourcing more manufacturing as a back up plan while Intel worked on reclaiming leadership with its own production. Other Intel leaders have argued that chip design technology has changed for good and that a hybrid approach of doing some work inside and some outside was the right way forward.Gelsinger will need to bring clarity to that muddled message, which has left customers and investors confused and doubting Intel’s direction.

2021-01-13	2021-01-13 17:13:57	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel CEO Bob Swan Is Replaced by VMware’s Pat Gelsinger	(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan will be replaced by VMware Inc. CEO Pat Gelsinger, who’s returning to the company he left more than a decade ago to shepherd it out of a crisis threatening its leadership of the chip industry.Swan was named to the top job in January 2019 after serving as interim chief for about six months, reluctantly taking the job after the firing of his predecessor, Brian Krzanich. Gelsinger will rejoin Intel, where he started his career as an engineer at age 18 and spent more than 30 years, working his way up the ranks before leaving in 2009 for EMC Corp. He was appointed CEO of software maker VMware in 2012.“After careful consideration, the board concluded that now is the right time to make this leadership change to draw on Pat’s technology and engineering expertise during this critical period of transformation at Intel,” Chairman Omar Ishrak said in a statement. Intel shares jumped as much as 13% in New York after the announcement and were up 8.4% at 11:09 a.m. CNBC earlier reported the move.The world’s largest chipmaker has been beset by manufacturing delays that have left it facing rivals who claim their products are better. Prominent customers such as Apple Inc. have deserted Intel and begun designing their own chips, and other massive buyers of silicon such as Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. have increasingly turned to supplying themselves. Swan said last year he was considering having the company outsource some of its chip production, a radical change, and was supposed to announce a decision early this year. Bloomberg has reported that Intel has already begun talking with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. about the Asian companies making some of its best chips.Over the past year, Intel’s stock has lagged behind competitors like Nvidia Inc., which dominates the market for graphics chips, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a smaller rival that makes microprocessors.Intel said the move was unrelated to its financial performance. The company expects fourth-quarter revenue and earnings per share to exceed its previous guidance. Intel has also made further progress on its 7-nanometer chip and will update investors on its scheduled earnings call on Jan. 21.Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said Gelsinger was likely the preferred external candidate in the last CEO shuffle.“He will be seen as a potential shot in the arm to attempt fixing both the company’s technical, as well as cultural, issues,” Rasgon said. He cautioned that the “next several years are likely set in stone” and any changes being made will not produce results for about three years.Gelsinger’s appointment marks a return to technical, home-grown leadership of Intel. Swan was the first person to lead the chipmaker who hadn’t spent most of his career at the company. Gelsinger also marks a return to a line of leadership that was groomed under Intel co-founder Andy Grove, who molded an organization that dominated the $400 billion industry for decades.Gelsinger, 59, previously served as chief technical officer of Intel after getting a start as one of the designers of the first of the company’s X86 series processors that are still the most widely used in computing today.“My experience at Intel has shaped my entire career, and I am forever grateful to this company,” he said in a note to employees posted on the company’s website. “To come back ‘home’ to Intel in the role of CEO during what is such a critical time for innovation, as we see the digitization of everything accelerating, will be the greatest honor of my career.”The first order of business for Intel’s new CEO will be to try fix the company’s manufacturing stumbles. Advancing production techniques, measured in nanometers or billionths of a meter, is one of the most important factors in improving the performance of semiconductors. Intel promised a step called 10-nanometer would appear in 2017. That’s only just reaching mainstream in important products now. Its successor, 7-nanometer, is also a year late. Those holdups have allowed TSMC, which provides outsourcing production for most of Intel’s rivals and many of its customers, to take the lead.That led to pressure from activist investor Dan Loeb, who in December urged the board to explore strategic alternatives for the company, including a possible breakup and sale of assets. Loeb’s Third Point LLC had threatened to launch a proxy fight if its concerns were not addressed. The hedge fund had not nominated directors to the board Wednesday morning ahead of a Thursday deadline to do so, according to people familiar with the matter.The change in leadership was met enthusiastically by Loeb. “Swan is a class act and did the right thing for all stake holders stepping aside for Gelsinger,” he wrote on Twitter.Santa Clara, California-based Intel is scheduled to hold a board meeting on Wednesday. A person familiar with the discussion said the decision to replace Swan was made by the board and not part of a settlement with Third Point. The board decided it wanted a person with more of a technology background rather than finance.Swan became interim CEO in 2018 and, after saying he didn’t want the job, was given it permanently in January 2019. The search to fill the role, after Krzanich was fired for a previous extra-marital relationship with an employee, led many analysts to suggest Gelsinger would be a strong candidate for the role. At the time he said he wanted to stay at VMware and that software was the future.“Mr. Gelsinger, in our book, is the best option for Intel at this time, but sadly, he should have been the CEO option to replace Brian Krzanich, not Bob Swan in early 2019,” said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann. “The change was widely expected in Silicon Valley and not soon enough, given Intel’s many structural manufacturing and architectural woes that will take years to mend.”Swan inherited the manufacturing problems and personnel from his predecessor, who had allowed Intel’s lead to slip and forced out a group of Intel veterans from the leadership team to replace them with outsiders such as former Qualcomm Inc. executive Murthy Renduchintala. Krzanich’s outside hires came from companies that didn’t do their own manufacturing and caused a break with Intel’s long-established method of growing its own leaders, something it’s now returning to with Gelsinger.Under Swan’s leadership, investors deserted Intel’s stock, concerned that he didn’t have the expertise to oversee the fixing of technical problems. Shares fell 17% in 2020 compared with a surge of about 50% by chip stocks on average. Matters came to a head in a July earnings call when he announced a further manufacturing delay and faced intense questioning on his plan to put that right. A subsequent call in October didn’t address those concerns adequately and caused further share declines.Both Swan and Gelsinger argue that computing is changing and spreading into new areas. Intel is moving away from a dependence primarily on its microprocessors - the type of chip Gelsinger helped design at the beginning of his career -- and moving to offer multiple types of chips suited to new work, such as artificial intelligence. Moves by Intel’s rivals and customers support that thesis but Intel is still largely dependent on its central processor business.(Updates with comparison to rivals in fifth paragraph and background throughout.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-ceo-bob-swan-replaced-153014440.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-13	2021-01-13 02:50:09	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC Profit Surge Cements Kingpin Role in Global Chip Crunch	(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. likely chalked up its fastest pace of profit growth in a decade, after the Taiwanese company cemented its role as chipmaker of choice to the world’s technology and auto giants.The world’s largest contract chipmaker is projected to report a 48.6% rise in 2020 net income Thursday, its speediest rate of expansion since 2010. Investors have sent its stock soaring 70% since the start of 2020, betting that the likes of Apple Inc. will continue to lean on its widening technological lead over Samsung Electronics Co. On Tuesday, Bernstein analysts raised their target on its shares to NT$800, anticipating a further gain of more than 30%.Taiwan’s largest company has spent billions in past years ensuring it remains at the forefront of chipmaking technology -- a costly exercise that paid off after Covid-19 sent millions online and powered demand for smartphones and computers. With chips becoming ubiquitous in everything from cars to fridges, it’s now become a lynchpin in a plethora of sectors including automaking.As rivals like United Microelectronics Corp. fall behind and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. struggles with American sanctions, TSMC’s pivotal role is likely to expand in 2021. Already, its preference for larger-volume electronics clients is exacerbating a severe shortage of automotive chips that’s forcing firms like Honda Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG to curtail production. Even Intel Corp. is now said to be considering outsourcing to the Asian firm after a series of inhouse technology slip-ups.“The world needs advanced silicon and only TSMC has that,” Bernstein’s Mark Li wrote. “There is risk if Intel regains and keeps tech superiority, but scale & execution record make it unlikely.”TSMC “is everyone’s foundry and treats its customers fairly and equally,” the chipmaker said in a statement Wednesday, stressing that it doesn’t play favorites.

It’s expected to report a 14% rise in net income for the December quarter off record sales, moderating from the heady pace of expansion in previous months.On Thursday, investors will want to see if TSMC will set aside another record amount for capital spending in 2021, after shelling out an estimated $17 billion last year to maintain its edge. And the auto industry would also be keen to hear whether TSMC has a solution to the shortages now plaguing its biggest names.Foundries such as TSMC, UMC and Globalfoundries Inc. aren’t expanding fast enough to meet the pandemic-induced spike in demand for gadgets. Those bottlenecks snarled the flow of chips not just to cars, but also Xboxes and PlayStations and even certain iPhones. TSMC is by far the most advanced of the foundries responsible for making a significant portion of the world’s semiconductors, serving the likes of Qualcomm Inc. and NXP Semiconductors NV, which also supply the mobile and auto industries.Read more: Missing Chips Snarl Car Production at Factories Worldwide(Adds company’s comment on customers in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-surging-profit-cements-kingpin-041420774.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-12	2021-01-12 09:45:11	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Missing Chips Snarl Car Production at Factories Worldwide	(Bloomberg) -- More than a year after its outbreak, the coronavirus keeps finding new ways to hit carmakers.After first wiping out auto demand, the virus is now hindering parts supply: chips used in vehicles are harder to come by because semiconductor manufacturers allocated more capacity to meet soaring demand from consumer-electronics makers such as Apple Inc.The shortage risks dragging on, with lockdowns and travel restrictions prompting housebound consumers to snap up more phones, game consoles, smart TVs and laptops to get online. Lower down in importance to chipmakers, auto manufacturers from Toyota Motor Corp. to Volkswagen AG risk not getting enough goods to fuel a fledgling recovery in their own industry.“Customers can’t build because they can’t get parts,” Glen De Vos, chief technology officer of car-component supplier Aptiv Plc, said in an interview. “We’ve avoided a situation where we’re shutting down customers, but we’ve been impacted.”Semiconductor shortages may persist throughout the first half as chipmakers adjust their operations, researcher IHS Market predicted on Dec. 23. Automakers will start to see component supply gradually ease in the next two to three months, China Passenger Car Association, which groups the country’s largest carmakers, said Monday.Chipmakers favor consumer-electronics customers because their orders are larger than those of automakers -- the annual smartphone market alone is more than 1 billion devices, compared with fewer than 100 million cars. Automaking is also a lower-margin business, leaving manufacturers unwilling to bid up chip prices as they avoid risking their profitability.And while the newest cars require more chips, so do the latest consumer gadgets. Smartphones using so-called 5G connectivity require 40% more semiconductors than older 4G versions. Chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported record fourth-quarter revenue last week, with new 5G iPhones taking up a large chunk of capacity.The auto-chip shortage stems from overly conservative demand estimates made early last year as car plants closed to cope with the onset of the pandemic, De Vos said. Once the plants re-opened, vehicle sales rebounded more strongly than anticipated after governments unleashed stimulus packages and commuters avoided public transport.At the same time, foundries such as TSMC, United Microelectronics Corp. and Globalfoundries Inc. as well as chip assemblers like ASE Technology Holding Co. weren’t expanding fast enough to meet the pandemic-induced spike in demand for consumer gadgets. Those bottlenecks snarled the flow of chips not just to cars, but also in Xboxes and Playstations and even certain iPhones. The foundries are responsible for making a significant portion of the world’s semiconductors and serve automotive-chip companies such as NXP Semiconductors NV, Infineon Technologies AG and Renesas Electronics Corp.The Trump administration’s move to blacklist China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. in December drove customers to seek alternatives and further constrained the global chip supply. Some semiconductor buyers have also been building up inventories to hedge against future shortages or disruptions.“It’ll take some time,” De Vos said, “but we’re climbing out of it.”Auto-chip companies cut orders with Taiwanese foundries significantly in the first half of 2020 and when they wanted the capacity back in the second half, the contract chipmakers had allocated it to others, a person familiar with the matter said.General Motors Co. has asked for the Taiwanese government’s help to secure chip supply, and Taiwanese officials have helped to relay the request to foundries including TSMC, according to the person. The European Union has also approached Taiwanese officials about the same issue, the person said.There’s no guarantee such requests will yield results -- smartphone and gadget customers contribute more to foundries’ revenue and profit and are willing to shell out more.“Consumer-electronics companies are ready to pay more for chips to ensure their gadgets will get to market on time,” said Jeff Pu, an analyst at GF Securities. “Carmakers are less inclined to do so.”Meanwhile, it’s not simple to boost semiconductor supply. Chipmakers need to spend years and billions of dollars to build fabrication plants capable of cranking out silicon for a wide range of products. They tend to err on the side of conservative planning because of the risks involved -- and the enormous potential losses.At least one major automotive chip supplier is having a significant volume of its orders turned away by TSMC because of lack of capacity, according to a person familiar with the matter. There are no signs of the situation getting easier for carmakers, the person said. A TSMC spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the company will discuss automotive chips at its investor conference on Thursday.Such setbacks have left some carmakers with no option but to cut production.Toyota said Tuesday it’s partially halting production in China while Honda Motor Co. is reducing output at five factories across North America as it becomes harder to procure chips.Toyota, the world’s No. 2 automaker, said the impacted lines were at its factory in Guangzhou, in China’s south. The suspension could result in a cut in January’s output of as much as 30% depending on how long it drags on, the Nikkei reported earlier Tuesday, without attribution. Toyota jointly operates the site with Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. Toyota is additionally lowering output of a pickup made in Texas.Honda, which had to scale back output at its U.K. plant last week, said it will reduce manufacturing of the Accord, Civic and Insight sedans, as well as the Odyssey minivan and Acura RDX, a crossover sports-utility vehicle. The Japanese automaker is also reducing output by about 4,000 cars at a domestic factory, while Nissan Motor Co. is adjusting production of its Note hatchback.VW said last month it would have to change manufacturing plans. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is temporarily closing a Canadian plant and delaying the restart of output at a Mexican Jeep factory until the end of January.“The global semiconductor shortage is presenting challenges and production disruptions,” Ford Motor Co. said in an emailed statement. The carmaker is working to prioritize key vehicle lines, “making the most of our semiconductor allocation.” In North America, Ford is idling a SUV factory in KentuckyCarmakers’ predicament is exacerbated by the fact that chips are crucial for the latest features they are touting, be it assisted driving, large displays or connectivity. Semiconductor-based components are set to account for more than 50% of a car’s manufacturing cost by 2030, up from about 35% now, according to a report by China EV 100 and Roland Berger.“Chips are getting more important for the upcoming software-defined cars,” said Shi Ji, an analyst at Haitong International Securities Co. in Hong Kong. “They are essential to all cars, not just electric ones.”(Updates with detail on Toyota, Honda cuts in 19th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/missing-chips-snarl-car-production-104929242.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-11	2021-01-11 21:30:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Says 10-Nanometer Server Chips Coming in First Quarter	(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. said a server chip built with its best production technique will be available in large volumes in the first quarter, an attempt to convince customers that its manufacturing operations are recovering from long delays.The third generation of Xeon Scalable processors, codenamed Ice Lake, is undergoing a “volume ramp” on Intel’s 10-nanometer production, the company said Monday.Advances in semiconductor manufacturing are measured in nanometers, or billionths of a meter, with smaller and smaller transistors crammed onto silicon wafers with each new iteration. This is a key way chipmakers create faster, more efficient and cheaper products.Intel’s 10-nanometer production is more than three years late, giving rivals including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. a chance to grab market share. Intel is considering outsourcing some production.Read more about Intel ‘Stunning Failure’ here. “Today marks a significant milestone for Intel as we continue to accelerate the delivery of our 10 nanometer products and maintain an urgent focus on execution to deliver a predictable cadence of leadership products,” said Navin Shenoy, executive vice president and general manager Intel’s Data Platforms Group.Intel’s data center business is its most profitable unit. Xeon chips are the heart of giant server farms run by cloud providers such as Amazon.com Inc. and Google. They’re the biggest buyers of these semiconductors, which can cost as much as a small car. However, these customers have begun designing their own data center chips and often have Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. make the components. TSMC is ahead of Intel in production technology.

2021-01-11	2021-01-11 15:14:38	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel In Talks With TSMC, Samsung To Outsource Production: Report	"California-based Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) has reportedly been in talks with Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTC: SSNLF) to outsource partial chip production after delays in its chip fabrication processes, Bloomberg reports.What Happened: Intel had reported problems with its 7-nanometer chip manufacturing process in July 2020 and announced a delay in the rollout of its next-generation chips to 2022, 2023. The company had said it was considering outsourcing some of its chip manufacturing.Intel's CEO Bob Swan has promised investors that he would set out outsourcing plans by Jan. 21, when it reports earnings. Swan said he would get the company's production technology back on track.Though Intel is the world's best-known chipmaker, it has suffered years-long delays that have put it behind competitors that design their own chips and outsource production to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor.Why It Matters: Rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) have raced ahead with their own designs and TSMC's advanced production technology, Bloomberg notes.""We have another great lineup of products in 2022, and I'm increasingly confident in the leadership our 2023 products will deliver on either Intel 7-nanometer or external foundry processes, or a combination of both,"" Swan said in October 2020. TSMC is the largest maker of semiconductors for other companies. It has offered to prepare Intel chips manufactured using a 4-nanometer process, with initial testing using an older 5-nanometer process, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter.TSMC will make 4-nanometer chips test production by the fourth quarter of 2021 and volume shipments by next year. As Intel keeps manufacturing its best semiconductors in-house, any outsourcing of this scale will require a potential supplier to create new capacity.Samsung is the world's biggest producer of memory chips and a competitor to TSMC. It has to look for big contracts for its foundry unit, the Financial Times reports.Bernstein analysts estimated Intel might outsource 10-30% of its CPU production in 2023 to TSMC, which would boost the latter's revenue by 5% to 10%. ""Samsung may get a minor share in this business,"" but TSMC technology is ahead of Samsung's ""with better execution,"" the Bernstein analysts said. Price Action: On the last check Monday, INTC shares are up 0.90% at $52.11, TSM shares are up by 3.09% at $122.36.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Samsung Picks Early Launch For Flagship Galaxy S Smartphones(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

2021-01-11	2021-01-11 01:58:30	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Samsung Surges After Intel Is Said to Consider Chip Outsourcing	(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. rose the most in almost 10 months after Intel Corp. was said to be considering asking the South Korean giant and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to make some of its most sophisticated chips, a major departure for the Silicon Valley pioneer.After successive delays in its chip fabrication processes, Santa Clara, California-based Intel has yet to make a final decision less than two weeks ahead of a scheduled announcement of its plans, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Any components that Intel might source from Taiwan wouldn’t come to market until 2023 at the earliest and would be based on established manufacturing processes already in use by other TSMC customers, said the people, asking not to be identified because the plans are private.Intel is still holding out hope for last-minute improvements in its own production capabilities. Talks with Samsung, whose foundry capabilities trail TSMC’s, are at a more preliminary stage, the people said. TSMC and Samsung representatives declined to comment. An Intel spokesperson referred to previous comments by Bob Swan, the company’s chief executive officer.Swan has promised investors he’ll set out his plans for outsourcing and get Intel’s production technology back on track when the company reports earnings Jan. 21. The world’s best-known chipmaker has historically led the industry in advanced manufacturing techniques, essential for maintaining the pace of performance increases in modern semiconductors. But the company has suffered years-long delays that have put it behind competitors that design their own chips and contract TSMC to do the manufacturing.Intel shares slid 1% Friday. Samsung soared more than 9% to an all-time high in Seoul Monday, the biggest gain since March on an intraday basis. TSMC, which is already operating at full throttle and may not have spare capacity in the short run, stood largely unchanged in Taipei after a 7-day wining streak.Read more: Intel Talks With TSMC, Samsung to Outsource Some Chip ProductionWhat Bloomberg Intelligence SaysIntel’s discussions with TSMC and Samsung solidify expectations that the company will outsource some production, a move we view as unlikely to be easy, cheap or quick, and one that’s likely to dent Intel’s competitive gross margin. Intel’s semiconductor manufacturing operations have been integrally woven into product design and delivery roadmaps since the company’s inception.\- Anand Srinivasan, analystClick here for the research.Under the leadership of Jim Keller, Intel designers moved to a more modular approach to creating microprocessors. This provides more flexibility to either make chips in-house or outsource the work. But Keller left Intel last year, and rivals, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Apple Inc., have forged ahead with their own capable designs and TSMC’s more advanced production technology. That has put Intel under intense competitive pressure and forced it to make last-minute changes to product road maps, complicating its decision making, the people said.“We have another great lineup of products in 2022, and I’m increasingly confident in the leadership our 2023 products will deliver on either Intel 7-nanometer or external foundry processes, or a combination of both,” Swan said on a conference call in October. Semiconductor manufacturing processes are measured in nanometers, with ever more microscopically small transistors crammed onto silicon wafers with each new iteration.At subsequent investor conferences, Swan explained that the timing of his decision is driven by the need to order chipmaking equipment to make sure he has enough factory capacity or give a partner enough of a heads-up to make similar preparations. Being able to predictably deliver leading products to customers on time, at the right cost, will determine how much outsourcing Intel uses, he said.Read more: Intel’s ‘Stunning Failure’ Heralds End of Era for U.S. Chip SectorTSMC, the largest maker of semiconductors for other companies, is preparing to offer Intel chips manufactured using a 4-nanometer process, with initial testing using an older 5-nanometer process, according to the people. The company has said it will make test production of 4-nanometer chips available in the fourth quarter of 2021 and volume shipments the following year.The Taiwanese company expects to have a new facility in Baoshan operational by the end of this year, which can be converted to production for Intel if required, one of the people said. TSMC executives previously said the new Baoshan unit would house a research center with 8,000 engineers.Activist investor Dan Loeb has also given voice to shareholder discontent with what’s perceived to be Intel’s technological stagnation, urging that the company make aggressive strategic changes.While Intel has outsourced production of lower-end chips before, it has kept the manufacturing of its best semiconductors in-house, considering it a competitive strength. Its engineers have historically tailored their designs to the company’s manufacturing processes, making a shift to outsourcing of flagship products unthinkable in the past.As the provider of 80% of personal computer and server processors globally, Intel produces hundreds of millions of chips each year. That scale dictates that any potential supplier must create new capacity to accommodate Intel.In July, the company said its 7-nanometer production would arrive a year later than previously planned. That followed a three-year delay in the introduction of the preceding 10-nanometer generation, which is only reaching mainstream use now. Those holdups have allowed TSMC and Samsung to lay claim to better technology for the first time, with TSMC already producing 5-nanometer silicon at volume for Apple and others. That timeline suggests other customers could move to better TSMC production before Intel would.Read more: Apple Launches Three New Macs to Kick Off Switch From IntelIntel’s strategic shifts are happening at a time of booming demand as well as technological change in the chip industry. The traditional method of improving performance by shrinking and cramming more transistors into each package is being supplanted by more sophisticated techniques that include stacking processor and memory components into single chips and the introduction of more tailored designs for tasks like artificial intelligence.AMD and others have partially mitigated the risk of manufacturing advances not proceeding at the expected pace by segmenting their designs, allowing the assembly of various component parts of the processor in stages.

Revenue in the quarter reached a record NT$361.5 billion, according to Bloomberg News’s calculations based on previously released monthly sales figures. That came in slightly below the average estimate of NT$364 billion, which had risen in past months as expectations around the iPhone grew.Shares of Apple’s main chipmaker have rallied more than 70% over the past 12 months and reached a record high on Friday. The company has predicted that the industry “mega trends” of 5G and high performance computing-related products will continue to drive growth over the long term.“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s 4Q revenue could exceed guidance of $12.7 billion on a continuation of strong chip orders from customers such as Apple” and Advanced Micro Devices, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum and Simon Chan wrote in a note Wednesday. Still, a strong Taiwan dollar and higher expenses for advanced 5-nanometer chip production may pressure the chipmaker’s operating margin, they added.Revenue for the entire year came in at NT$1.34 trillion, up roughly 25% from 2019. TSMC is scheduled to report quarterly profit on Jan. 14.Robust demand for the new iPhones have provided a boost to other Apple suppliers. Assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. earlier this week beat quarterly revenue expectations, while British-German chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor Plc increased its sales forecasts due to stronger-than-expected demand for 5G phones and tablets.Read more: IPhone Supply Chain Sends Bullish Signal on 5G After Tepid StartFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-supplier-tsmc-quarterly-revenue-054136718.html?.tsrc=rss

Tokyo Electron Ltd. also reached a new high while Nikon Corp., whose precision equipment business now brings in a larger share of revenue than its more familiar camera operations, added 4.6%.TSMC spokeswoman Nina Kao declined to comment, citing the company’s quiet period before its earnings announcement.Japan has been boosting spending in semiconductor manufacturing and cutting-edge technology as it eyes the national security implications amid U.S.-China confrontation over the technologies -- an area the country lacks in expertise despite being a world leader in chip-making equipment and materials.The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry allocated 110 billion yen ($1.1 billion) in the fiscal 2019 budget and an additional 90 billion yen to a forthcoming extra budget to manufacture advanced chips domestically.While traders jumped on the TSMC report on speculation the deal will help advance Japan’s competitiveness in the field, its impact may be limited. A chip assembly plant, while an important stage in the semiconductor production process usually requires much less investments than a chip fabrication facility: the world’s largest chip testing and packaging service provider ASE Technology Holding spent slightly less than $1.6 billion in capital expenditure in 2019, while TSMC spent about 9 times that amount.Seiichi Miyashita, an assistant manager at the IT industry division of Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, said no decision had been made, but that the ministry was conscious of the need for Japan to acquire the ability to manufacture advanced chips domestically.The Yomiuri newspaper reported in July last year that Japan had offered several billions of dollars in support to TSMC to tempt it to build plants in the country. At least one Japanese delegation traveled to Taiwan hoping of convincing the chipmaker to invest, a person with knowledge of the visit told Bloomberg News last year.That followed TSMC’s decision to build a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona which will employ its 5-nanometer technology, though even that will likely be several generations old by the time output begins.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japan-chip-sector-boosted-report-083807974.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-04	2021-01-04 14:55:46	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Applied Materials Lifts Bid for Kokusai to $3.5 Billion	(Bloomberg) -- Applied Materials Inc., one of the largest makers of machines used to manufacture semiconductors, said it raised its offer for KKR & Co.-owned Kokusai Electric Corp. by 59%, citing higher valuations in a growing industry. It also extended the closing deadline by almost three months.The U.S. company will pay KKR $3.5 billion, up from the originally agreed $2.2 billion, for Kokusai, Applied said in a filing. The two parties have agreed to a new closing date of Mar. 19 to allow for regulatory approval from China, the final remaining jurisdiction where sign-off is needed.Applied said the large increase reflects improving demand for chipmaking gear and the earnings prospects for the combined entity, part of a growing trend that’s pushed up the valuations of industry companies. It’s making progress toward getting the green light from China‘s State Administration for Market Regulation. Shares of Applied Materials climed 3.2% to $89.03 at 9:50 a.m. in New York.The U.S. firm “believes that the acquisition will provide substantial value for Applied’s shareholders,” according to the filing. “Over the past 18 months, Applied has observed a more favorable long-term outlook for the overall semiconductor equipment market, including positive trends in the memory segment.”Chip-related share prices have surged on optimism that the electronic components are becoming more important, not only in traditional markets such as computers and smartphones, but also in new areas such as self-driving cars. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index surged 51% in 2020, adding to a gain of 60% in 2019. Shares of Applied Materials rose 41% last year.Applied’s ability to get approval from China will be watched closely by investors. Semiconductors have become a key area of contention in the trade war between China and the U.S. under the administration of President Donald Trump. The U.S. is the world’s biggest producer of chips and the Asian country is the biggest market.California-based Applied Materials dominates the market for equipment involved in the early stages of turning silicon wafers into computer chips. Its main customers are Samsung Electronics Co., Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Applied Materials went on a sales-growth spurt under Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson as chipmakers ordered more machinery to help solve the increasing complexity of semiconductors.Investment firm KKR bought the Japanese equipment manufacturer, a former Hitachi Ltd. unit, in 2017. Before the deal closed, KKR made a bid that valued Kokusai Electric at $3 billion, although it’s not clear how much KKR ultimately paid.(Updates with shares in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applied-materials-lifts-bid-kokusai-145546042.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-29	2020-12-29 20:17:36	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Pushed to Explore Options by Activist Investor Loeb	(Bloomberg) -- Activist investor Dan Loeb has built a position in Intel Corp. and is urging the company to explore strategic alternatives, including a possible breakup of the chipmaker and the sale of assets.Loeb’s fund, Third Point LLC, has “built a significant stake” in Intel and plans to push for changes, including potentially nominating directors, he said Tuesday in a letter to Intel Chairman Omar Ishrak. Loeb said the company has dramatically underperformed its peers in the past five years, including losing more than $60 billion in market value this year alone.“We cannot fathom how the boards who presided over Intel’s decline could have permitted management to fritter away the company’s leading market position while simultaneously rewarding them handsomely with extravagant compensation package,” Loeb said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg. “Stakeholders will no longer tolerate such apparent abdications of duty.”Intel said in a statement that it welcomed input from all investors to create shareholder value, and looked forward to engaging with Third Point toward that goal. Loeb also said he expected the discussions to be productive, but reserved the right to nominate directors should he sense a “reluctance” to address his concerns.Intel is in the midst of its worst crisis in at least a decade. The Santa Clara, California-based company has been the largest chipmaker for most of the past 30 years by combining the best designs with cutting-edge factories. Most other U.S. chip companies shut or sold plants and tapped other firms to make the components. Intel held out, arguing that doing both improved each side of its operation and created better semiconductors. That strategy is being questioned now as the company’s manufacturing capabilities fall behind the new industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.Read more: Intel’s Chipmaking Throne Is Challenged by Taiwanese UpstartIntel’s factories are struggling to keep up with the latest 7-nanometer production process, while TSMC has already moved beyond that to an even more advanced version. Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan is considering outsourcing some production and has said he will decide on this in early 2021. That would be a radical change for the company and even his suggestion caused the stock to plunge earlier this year.Loeb urged Intel to hire an investment bank to evaluate strategic alternatives, including whether it should remain an integrated device manufacturer and to explore the divestment of “certain failed acquisitions.” He said there were other issues he would like to discuss privately, and planned to file with regulators to allow for Third Point to continue to buy shares in the company and engage more actively with it.Shares rose more than 5% to $49.50 in New York, giving the company a market value of about $200 billion. Reuters reported on the letter earlier Tuesday.“Perhaps the letter will act as a push, but the company is (supposedly) currently engaged in exactly this sort of exercise,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note to clients. “We already know Intel is in the process of considering alternatives in the wake of their manufacturing issues (we are supposed to get a plan in January) though so far recent public commentary has been more suggestive of ‘evolutionary’ approaches.”Read more: Intel ‘Stunning Failure’ Heralds End of Era for U.S. Chip SectorLoeb argued in the letter that Intel has fallen behind the technological advances of its competitors, and is at further risk now that many of its customers, including Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc., are developing their own in-house chips. He said Intel must figure out a way to serve its competitors as customers, like Netflix Inc. has by using Amazon’s AWS for cloud services, for example.“You must be able to offer new independent solutions to retain those customers rather than have them send their manufacturing away,” he said.Third Point has pushed for changes at some some of the largest corporations in the world, including Walt Disney Co., Sony Corp. and Campbell Soup Co., among others.(Updates with analyst comment in ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-pushed-explore-options-activist-180724504.html?.tsrc=rss

Note that AMD stock has gone from $48 to $94 and the market capitalization is at $112 billion. It really is hard to believe that the company was on the verge of bankruptcy six years ago. So yes, AMD stands as one of the greatest tech turnaround ever.

The CEO who has accomplished this is Lisa Su – and she certainly deserves much more attention. When she came on board the company, she was smart to outsource production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), cut costs, bolster the balance sheet and to rethink the product development roadmap.
She also had the right mix of technical and business experience to bring AMD back from the brink. Before joining the company, she served as an executive at companies like Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NXPI). As for her education, she received a Ph.D. from MIT and has published more than 40 technical papers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Now I’ve been bullish on AMD stock for quite some time. The company is targeting a variety of major growth markets like gaming, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
7 Undervalued Stocks That Could Soar in 2021
But then again, there are still risks to consider. For example, the company recently agreed to a $35 billion merger with Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX). While there are good synergies, the deal will be complex and require disciplined integration.
Yet there are some other risks as well. So let’s take a look.
The Threats
AMD has been around since the late 1960s. But during much of this time, the company has been a marginal player in the computer processing unit space. Of course, the dominant rival was Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
But interestingly enough, for the past few years, Intel was beset by quality issues, delays and drama in the executive suite. And AMD did a pretty good job on capitalizing on this. This has especially been the case in the data center segment, which is quite lucrative.
Although, Intel is starting to get things back on track. The company certainly has significant resources, technical talent and marketing capabilities. So in the next few years, AMD will likely feel much more pressure from Intel. It seems inevitable.
In the meantime, there will emerge another threat – that is, the mega tech operators like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). They are actually building their own advanced chipsets. Often these are focused on unique use cases like AI and machine learning.
This is not to imply that these companies will sell the chipsets. But the tech companies can still monetize this technology by providing access via cloud platforms on a usage basis.
We’ve already have seen a glimpse of the potential impact on this emerging trend. On reports that Microsoft was developing its own CPUs, Intel shares got hit by about 10%.

Bottom Line on AMD Stock
There are also risks for AMD stock in terms of its business model. For example, the outsourcing of production poses issues. Even if demand continues to be strong, there may ultimately be capacity problems as other chip companies and mega tech operators buy up supplies.
So yes, AMD stock is far from a guarantee. However, I do not see a sudden downturn either.
The issues for the company will likely not become a problem until the next few years, such as with the impact from the mega tech operators. But I also think it will get tough to churn out growth on the top line.
Besides, AMD stock is far from cheap, with the shares trading at 51 times forward earnings.
In other words, it’s probably a good idea to be more cautious on the shares for now.

2020-12-23	2020-12-23 02:18:38	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	How Chinese Chip Giant SMIC Can Evade Trump’s Newest Crackdown	(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump’s latest headline-grabbing action against China is aimed at negating the Asian power’s push toward self-sufficiency in the $400 billion semiconductor industry. But its effectiveness is being questioned almost before the ink is dry, according to a growing chorus of voices in Washington and interviews with Chinese technology executives.The U.S. is blacklisting Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. along with more than 60 of its peers deemed a threat to national security, depriving them of the American inputs from software to chemicals required to make their products. The key provision of the action against China’s largest chipmaker is a restriction on selling equipment and other items used to fabricate advanced chips, an area U.S. suppliers dominate.But in a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Tuesday, Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Michael McCaul warned the action was “utterly ineffective” and fell short of crippling Beijing’s drive into next-generation semiconductors.The pair echo the concerns of industry executives and government officials who argue the White House should do more to hamstring SMIC, one of several companies instrumental to Beijing’s ambitions of supplanting American dominance in a plethora of spheres including semiconductors. Arguably one of the world’s most important industries, the ability to manufacture semiconductors is crucial for everything from artificial intelligence and data centers to autonomous cars, smartphones, and advanced weapons systems. SMIC’s shares rose as much as 1.3% in Hong Kong Wednesday.Stockpiling materialsIn his bid to halt China’s semiconductor ambitions, Trump is turning to some of the same tools deployed against Huawei Technologies Co. Those measures succeeded in stunting Huawei’s growth, but failed to decisively undermine its lead in 5G networking or kill its giant smartphone division. Like its larger compatriot, SMIC anticipated the U.S. action, stockpiling as much as 18 months’ worth of chemicals and other raw materials to keep its machines humming, people close to the company said. And it hiked its capital spending budget twice this year to $6.7 billion before taking it back citing U.S. regulatory uncertainty.“We are deeply concerned that the rules pursuant to the Entity Listing for the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Company (SMIC) will be utterly ineffective in addressing this growing national security threat,” Rubio and McCaul wrote. “We are deeply concerned that SMIC’s placement on the Entity List by the Bureau of Industry and Security was done for show.”Read more: U.S. Blacklists More Than 60 Chinese Firms, Including SMICBeijing has long worried a concerted White House campaign to contain the nation’s tech ascendancy -- which has already shaken up the supply chain for everything from iPhones to laptops -- will kneecap its rapidly developing chip industry. Washington had already targeted Huawei’s secretive HiSilicon division, while SMIC was grappling with rules introduced earlier this year designed to cut off supply to China’s military. In response, Beijing is said to be preparing broad support for so-called third-generation semiconductors and conferring the same kind of priority on the effort it accorded to building its atomic capability.Advanced ChipsWhite House officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the U.S. measures were too narrow.A representative for SMIC, which has repeatedly denied supplying the People’s Liberation Army, declined to comment beyond a statement this week warning of “major adverse impact” on its plans.Within the company, engineers are scrambling to assess the fallout and figure out workarounds to secure the equipment it needs, much like Huawei did two years prior, another person familiar with the matter said. At issue is the administration’s focus on drawing a line at 10-nanometer technology, banning the sale of equipment intended for use in more advanced processes. SMIC could conceivably repurpose 80% of older-generation gear to crank out more advanced chips, but that tactic won’t sustain production for the longer term and much depends on how far President-elect Joe Biden decides to take the rules, a third person close to the situation said, asking not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.“The company has already got critical equipment and materials needed to continue production,” said Xiang Ligang, Beijing-based director-general of the Information Consumption Alliance. “In the past, China wasn’t too sensitive about the technological bottlenecks it has. But now, Beijing is fully aware of the potential damage and is determined to solve these issues.”Chinese government-backed SMIC, a manufacturer of chips for global names from Qualcomm Inc. to Broadcom Inc., relies on U.S. gear for its longer-term technology road map. While its engineers may be able to sustain research and output in the short run, the latest sanctions basically freeze its capabilities while the industry advances. If a Biden White House takes it to the max, SMIC could be blocked from 7nm or more advanced technology while overseas rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. dominate the market. The heightened scrutiny may also discourage clients leery of dealing with the uncertainty.Entity ListBut while that rule seems hard and fast, it misses the point that much of the equipment needed for 10nm or better is already in use for less advanced production, meaning SMIC may already have the gear it needs to keep its plants ticking over for a while. McCaul and Rubio argue SMIC can re-purpose as much as nearly 95% of available, older-generation tools.“Without question SMIC deserves to be on the Entity List, but the lawyerly language of the tool rule undermines the intent of the designation,” said James Mulvenon, director for intelligence integration at SOS International and the author of a book on forced technology transfers to China.Read more: Huawei Outhustles Trump by Hoarding Chips Vital for China 5GThe debate highlights the difficulty for U.S. policy makers of choosing such a globalized and technical industry to project geopolitical aims. That follows a series of assaults against some of China’s most recognizable names, with varying levels of success: ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat have tied up Executive Order bans in court, while video surveillance giant Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. is up 37% this year despite joining Huawei on the Entity List.Largest marketChina is by far the largest market for semiconductors and heavily reliant on imports. Gear suppliers such as Applied Materials Inc. and KLA Corp. with production facilities in Asia could argue that machines made there aren’t subject to U.S. jurisdiction, though Commerce officials have said companies exporting parts made outside of the U.S. to SMIC will still face restrictions depending on how much of their technologies are of American origin.The legality of that seeming loophole remains unclear, particularly as U.S. officials pressure allies to cut off Chinese clients.Another concern is the fundamental complexity of the industry, which means that Washington decision-makers must rely on the companies themselves to explain the intricacies of their products. That’s partly why the process of applying to the Commerce Department for export licenses has dragged on.Entegris Inc. Chief Executive Officer Bertrand Loy, who is also chairman of the industry’s largest trade group, SEMI, said no one quite knows yet how the latest sanctions will play out. “Which products exactly are targeted is not entirely clear,” he told Bloomberg News this week.(Updates with shares in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-chip-giant-smic-evade-140000593.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-16	2020-12-16 12:03:36	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	China’s Top Chipmaker Slides After Co-CEO Abruptly Quits	(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. shares fell after news emerged about the surprise resignation of a top executive who spearheaded the rapid technological ascent of China’s largest chipmaker.SMIC is trying to reach co-Chief Executive Officer Liang Mong Song after online media circulated a resignation letter they said originated with the industry veteran. Liang quit after SMIC appointed a vice chairman without consulting him, according to the reports. The company is attempting to clarify his intentions, it said in an exchange filing without elaborating. Liang couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.Shanghai’s stock exchange issued the company a “supervision letter,” SMIC said in a separate filing Wednesday evening. The letters typically mean the exchange has noticed a problem with the company and serve as a warning to resolve it.SMIC’s shares slid at least 4.9% at the close in Shanghai and Hong Kong, underscoring the executive’s pivotal role within a state-backed national champion trying to navigate a volatile U.S.-Chinese relationship. Liang handed in his resignation after learning about the appointment of Chiang Shang-yi -- a former senior executive at larger rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. -- to the board, media including Digitimes reported. Liang, a fellow TSMC alumnus, was considered integral to SMIC’s efforts to become a major player in the business of fabricating wafers for global giants. The corporation has long relied on a cohort of Taiwanese executives including Liang to narrow the gap with TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co.“SMIC’s recent technology progress was directly attributable to Liang,” Bernstein analysts including Mark Li wrote. “Though the addition of Chiang is a positive, as the vice chairman his role is advisory. Liang, however, has been personally leading SMIC’s technology development and his contribution directly resulted in the mass production of 14nm, for example. Considering them both, we believe Liang’s departure will have a bigger effect, and SMIC’s future technology progress may see a setback.”Read more: China Said to Plan Broad Chip Sector Support to Fight TrumpLiang was instrumental in leading a 2,000-strong engineering team and helping SMIC migrate to cutting-edge 7nm process technology, slated to go into production in April. It’s unclear if his exit was directly linked to the appointment of Chiang, who left SMIC’s board in 2019 to take charge of another signature Chinese project, memory chipmaker Wuhan Hongxin. That company has since been taken over by the local Hubei government after encountering funding shortages.SMIC in contrast has roughly doubled its market value in 2020 despite the risk of U.S. sanctions, aided by a mega sale of stock in Shanghai and, more broadly, ballooning demand for chips as China’s economy emerges from Covid-19. The Shanghai-based firm, a supplier to Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc., lies at the heart of Beijing’s intention to build a world-class semiconductor industry and wean itself off a reliance on American technology.But it’s now also among a plethora of Chinese corporations Washington has labeled a national security threat, a designation that threatens to cripple its longer-term ambitions by denying it access to crucial gear and circuitry. Companies including Huawei Technologies Co. have been caught in the middle of worsening tensions between the world’s two largest economies, which have clashed on issues from trade to the pandemic.In response to the widening U.S. crackdown, China is planning to provide broad support for so-called third-generation semiconductors in its next five-year plan to increase domestic self-sufficiency in chip manufacturing, people with knowledge of the matter have said. SMIC, backed by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund as well as Singapore’s sovereign fund GIC Pte and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, is expected to play a central role in that overall effort.“Being a national champion with huge governmental investments, SMIC inevitably has some considerations that professional managers may not share,” Bernstein wrote. “Building a team that collaborates together toward a common goal is essential, but is something that money alone can’t buy.”(Updates with prices in second paragraph and letter from Shanghai exchange in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-chinese-chipmaker-plunges-reports-015342391.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-12-15	2020-12-15 22:00:20	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Biden Can Forget About Making IPhones in the U.S.	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- While much of Joe Biden’s first term in office will involve digging out from the Covid-19 pandemic and recession, the incoming president has also vowed to change the way the U.S. manages its supply chains. This is framed as a way to make America more resilient in the face of crises after struggling to secure much-needed protective and medical materials in the early days of the coronavirus.But it’s obvious that his supply-chain policy centers on weaning the U.S. and its allies off China. Already dashed is the old theory that free trade would induce Beijing to peacefully democratize and integrate itself smoothly into existing global institutions.The escalating technological, geopolitical and economic rivalry between the superpowers gives greater urgency to a plan for diversification. But this requires that Biden focus on making supply chains more efficient, rather than merely bringing masses of manufacturing jobs back to American shores.Diversification isn’t the same as reshoring. The model of distributed production that multinational companies have built over the past three decades will not revert to a world of doing things within a single country’s borders.The comparative U.S. advantages — advanced technology, a good business climate, and a wealthy consumer base, rather than cheap wages and lax regulations — won’t change. The Biden team should focus not on the return of low-end assembly work, but on capturing the highest-value segments of the production chain as it shifts the rest away from its chief competitor and toward allies. President Donald Trump already tried to force reshoring, and failed spectacularly. He lured Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group to open a plant in Wisconsin, only to see the project shrink massively as it became apparent there was actually no plan at all. The problem is that Apple Inc.'s iPhone and Sony Corp.'s PlayStation simply aren't meant to be Made in America. Beyond the difference in labor costs, companies like Foxconn rely on the ability to hire hundreds of thousands of workers for short periods, unencumbered by unions or long-term contracts.Foxconn executives have already told us they don't foresee American workers actually wanting to stand on a production line to assemble delicate items like iPhones and iPads. Even in China, where the workforce is five times larger, fewer people desire such jobs. Companies have had to move factories further toward the interior of the country just to be closer to the labor pool.And this work doesn't add a lot of value, anyway. A look at the gross margins of Foxconn's Hon Hai unit tells the story. It squeezed out just $5.91 for each $100 of production that churned through its factories last year. Apple, by contrast, gets to keep a $38.23 markup per $100 from the array of devices, software and services.A plan to bring Foxconn compatriot Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to Arizona makes more sense, but semiconductors are capital intensive and labor light. The Biden administration will need to manage expectations on the number and types of jobs to be created. A majority of these positions will be in advanced roles — 75% of TSMC’s staff have finished college, and half its workforce has postgraduate degrees — which will be a boon for American engineers and universities. That kind of value-add work generates a lot more dollars than low-margin assembly. But it won’t be a source of mass employment. To create lots of jobs, the U.S. will need to leverage local services instead — something the incoming administration fortunately grasps.That leaves the question of where to put supply chains. Washington should sit down with industry to map out what does and doesn't make sense to build in the U.S.Electric vehicles, for example, increasingly include sophisticated components and modules that rely on high-tech manufacturing rather than cheap labor and command high prices in global markets. Servers, communications equipment and electronics weapons systems are likewise low-volume, high-priced products that can be made in the U.S. cost-effectively.But other parts of the puzzle should go to current and prospective U.S. allies.Future Secretary of State Antony Blinken should embark on a world tour to arrange investment deals, with an eye to getting manufacturing out of China as fast as possible. The administration’s to-do list should include formulating a Silicon Road policy to compete with China, and securing technology within the borders of trusted allies.By helping relocate production that doesn’t make sense for the U.S. to places like Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Mexico, then Washington can move to secure their allegiance through job creation, investment and controlled technology transfers. Vietnam has shown particular potential as an alternative to China, as evidenced by Samsung Electronics Co.’s employment of more than 100,000 people there. Its recent infrastructure upgrades, including the construction of new highways, was financed in part by loans from the Asian Development Bank. This kind of funding is exactly where the U.S. could step in, offering an alternative to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.All this requires a big change from Trump’s belligerent approach to trade — which largely involved tariffs and other barriers — and goes beyond the current U.S. policy of doling out incentives and bellowing threats.Globalized overseas supply chains are here to stay, but what a Biden administration can really do is ensure that they move to more stable and advantageous locations.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-12-10	2020-12-10 04:03:39	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	A $4.5 Billion Chip Deal Shows Dark Side of the Boom	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A decision by Taiwan’s GlobalWafers Co. to buy its German rival Siltronic AG marks an expensive bet on consolidation that exposes the stark reality of their slice of the semiconductor market. For the seller, it’s the best deal they could have hoped for.GlobalWafers agreed to a tender bid that values the target at 3.75 billion euros ($4.5 billion). Unsurprisingly, Siltronic’s major shareholder Wacker Chemie AG is delighted and has agreed to sell its 31% stake. It knows it won’t get a better offer.That’s because at 125 euros per share, Siltronic is being bought for almost 25 times this year’s projected earnings. In other words, assuming constant income, it would take a quarter of a century to earn that money back. The only way that GlobalWafers could justify the deal is if there’s a real prospect that the merger will boost earnings through revenue growth or cost cuts. Neither is likely. The target company expects earnings per share to be “significantly below prior year” in 2020. These companies are in the important but mundane business of making and cutting silicon ingots into the thin slices upon which semiconductors are made. Their specific slice of the chip market is underperforming the rest. What’s worse, Siltronic has been a laggard, growing more slowly than the broader wafer market.ccording to industry group SEMI, global wafer shipments will climb 2.4% this year and 5% next. By contrast, broader chip demand will expand by 5.1% and 8% respectively, Worldwide Semiconductor Trade Statistics Inc. projects. This disparity is explained by technological advances, with manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. able to shrink chips and cram more onto each wafer. Great news for smartphone makers and consumers, terrible for those that make the wafers.So that means strong industry growth is unlikely to be a driver. However, the merger will create a supplier with around one-third of global silicon wafer revenue. If it is to boost sales, beyond what the combination creates, then it can probably only do so with the pricing power that comes with size. But one-third of the market may not be enough, and using that power would create enormous antitrust risks.That leaves cost cuts as the other chief way to juice the bottom line. Yet GlobalWafers said it will keep all Siltronic staff until the end of 2024. Ouch! Perhaps Chairwoman Doris Hsu remembers that infamous moment in Taiwan M&A history: the BenQ-Siemens debacle of 2005, which saw the Taipei-based electronics maker get stuck with thousands of Siemens AG staff it couldn’t lay off due to German labor laws.There may be some wiggle room for the merged business to squeeze better pricing out of suppliers. Even so, that hardly justifies a 48% premium to the 90-day average price of Siltronic shares prior to the first disclosure of this deal two weeks ago.Funding is also a worry. GlobalWafers will pay in cash through financing arranged by DBS Group Holdings Ltd. Siltronic had just 36.3 million euros in free cash flow last year — barely 1% of the acquisition price — and has said it expects net cash flow to decline this year. Further, GlobalWafers has committed  to “ensuring adequate capex to support existing wafer production lines.” So the takeover could be a real drain on the buyer with limited benefit to revenue, or cash.The world may well be experiencing booming demand for the chips that power our digital lives. But every now and then a deal comes along that exposes the disparities in this global industry. GlobalWafers’ purchase of Siltronic shows that not all semiconductor suppliers are created equal. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-12-07	2020-12-07 14:46:19	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Preps Next Mac Chips With Aim to Outclass Top-End PCs	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning a series of new Mac processors for introduction as early as 2021 that are aimed at outperforming Intel Corp.’s fastest.Chip engineers at the Cupertino, California-based technology giant are working on several successors to the M1 custom chip, Apple’s first Mac main processor that debuted in November. If they live up to expectations, they will significantly outpace the performance of the latest machines running Intel chips, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the plans aren’t yet public. Intel’s shares slid 2.9% in New York Monday after the news. Apple shares were up 1.3% at 9:46 a.m.Apple’s M1 chip was unveiled in a new entry-level MacBook Pro laptop, a refreshed Mac mini desktop and across the MacBook Air range. The company’s next series of chips, planned for release as early as the spring and later in the fall, are destined to be placed across upgraded versions of the MacBook Pro, both entry-level and high-end iMac desktops, and later a new Mac Pro workstation, the people said.The road map indicates Apple’s confidence that it can differentiate its products on the strength of its own engineering and is taking decisive steps to design Intel components out of its devices. The next two lines of Apple chips are also planned to be more ambitious than some industry watchers expected for next year. The company said it expects to finish the transition away from Intel and to its own silicon in 2022.While Intel gets less than 10% of its revenue from furnishing Apple with Mac chips, the rest of its PC business is liable to face turbulence if the iPhone maker is able to deliver demonstrably better-performing computers. It could accelerate a shakeup in an industry that has long been dependent on Intel’s pace of innovation. For Apple, the move sheds that dependency, deepens its distinction from the rest of the PC market and gives it a chance to add to its small, but growing share in PCs.An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Chip development and production is complex with changes being common throughout the development process. Apple could still choose to hold back these chips in favor of lesser versions for next year’s Macs, the people said, but the plans nonetheless indicate Apple’s vast ambitions.Apple’s Mac chips, like those in its iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, use technology licensed from Arm Ltd., the chip design firm whose blueprints underpin much of the mobile industry and which Nvidia Corp. is in the process of acquiring. Apple designs the chips and outsources their production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has taken the lead from Intel in chip manufacturing.Read more: Nvidia CEO Argues Arm Purchase Will Strengthen EcosystemThe current M1 chip inherits a mobile-centric design built around four high-performance processing cores to accelerate tasks like video editing and four power-saving cores that can handle less intensive jobs like web browsing. For its next generation chip targeting MacBook Pro and iMac models, Apple is working on designs with as many as 16 power cores and four efficiency cores, the people said.While that component is in development, Apple could choose to first release variations with only eight or 12 of the high-performance cores enabled depending on production, they said. Chipmakers are often forced to offer some models with lower specifications than they originally intended because of problems that emerge during fabrication.For higher-end desktop computers, planned for later in 2021 and a new half-sized Mac Pro planned to launch by 2022, Apple is testing a chip design with as many as 32 high-performance cores.With today’s Intel systems, Apple’s highest-end laptops offer a maximum of eight cores, a high-end iMac Pro is available with as many as 18 and the priciest Mac Pro desktop features as much as a 28-core system. Though architecturally different, Apple and Intel’s chips rely on the segmentation of workloads into smaller, serialized tasks that several processing cores can work on at once.Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which has been gaining market share at Intel’s expense, offers standard desktop parts with as many as 16 cores, with some of its high-end chips for gaming PCs going as high as 64 cores.While the M1 silicon has been well received, the Macs using it are Apple’s lower-end systems with less memory and fewer ports. The company still sells higher-end, Intel-based versions of some of the lines that received M1 updates. The M1 chip is a variation of a new iPad processor destined to be included in a new iPad Pro arriving next year.Apple engineers are also developing more ambitious graphics processors. Today’s M1 processors are offered with a custom Apple graphics engine that comes in either 7- or 8-core variations. For its future high-end laptops and mid-range desktops, Apple is testing 16-core and 32-core graphics parts.For later in 2021 or potentially 2022, Apple is working on pricier graphics upgrades with 64 and 128 dedicated cores aimed at its highest-end machines, the people said. Those graphics chips would be several times faster than the current graphics modules Apple uses from Nvidia and AMD in its Intel-powered hardware.(Updates shares in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-144619418.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-28	2020-11-28 22:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Suppliers’ Exodus From China Won’t Slow Down Under Biden	(Bloomberg) -- The splintering of the global tech supply chain that began during President Donald Trump’s watch looks set to persist under his successor.Apple Inc., the largest of the many tech giants that rely on Chinese factories to make their gadgets, will move some production of its iPads and MacBooks to Vietnam. Key assembly partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., known also as Foxconn, has allocated $270 million in new investments to the Southeast Asian country. Those moves presage a larger and longer-term migration that may have ramifications for the iPhone maker as well as China’s role as workshop to the world.Foxconn founder Terry Gou coined the term “G2” to describe the trend of a unified supply chain splitting into at least two. Company Chairman Young Liu said in August that the likes of India, Southeast Asia and the Americas could each in the future end up with a dedicated manufacturing ecosystem of their own. The trend now looks irreversible as other countries including India and Vietnam are boosting their infrastructure and efforts to lure manufacturers through lower costs and fewer geopolitical worries.“As China gets more expensive, and as U.S. politics have been unpredictable, companies have shifted production of some goods out of China. That trend will continue as China gets more expensive and as Vietnam and India improve their competitiveness,” said Dan Wang, a technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics.Read more: Apple’s Shifting Supply Chain Creates Boomtowns in Rural VietnamTrump’s trade hostilities against China caused many manufacturers to shift production capacity to neighboring countries like Vietnam and further afield to sites in Mexico and India, in order to avoid being slapped with punitive tariffs and to mitigate future sanctions risk. Apple, whose Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook orchestrated the creation of its current Chinese-centric production chain, has resisted a large-scale move but in recent years has increasingly explored alternatives.The Cupertino, California-based company is continuing to add iPhone capacity in India through its assembly partners, aided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policy to attract top-tier smartphone companies to make their gadgets locally for export. Pegatron Corp., the last of the major iPhone assemblers to arrive in the country, announced earlier this month it is injecting 11 billion rupees ($150 million) into its Indian unit and will start production there as soon as late 2021.Back at home, the iPhone maker has been lobbying the U.S. government to support local chip production with tax breaks. Its key supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is planning a chip fab in Arizona, though the modest scale and technology of that facility would suggest it will service smaller customers, at least to begin with.Beyond Apple, Alphabet Inc.’s Google has placed orders with Foxconn to assemble key components for its servers in Wisconsin, at the under-utilized facility that has to date been most famous for what it hasn’t produced. Mass production there is expected to go ahead in the first quarter. Pegatron officials said earlier this month that the company plans to also set up manufacturing operations in the U.S. to serve other customers.Wistron Corp., another Taiwanese contract manufacturer that handles iPhone orders as well as laptop and server production for other American customers, announced plans earlier this month to add capacity in Mexico and Taiwan. It’s also buying a Western Digital Corp. factory in Malaysia. Chairman Simon Lin said in March that half of Wistron’s capacity can be located outside of China as soon as 2021, with Vietnam operations ramping up and the company seeing India as a key strategic site for the next decade due to its market size and resources.Trump’s tariffs on Chinese-made products have also forced other international companies to rethink their manufacturing operations. Nintendo Co. now has some of its Switch console production handled by Sharp Corp. in Malaysia, after it asked its main assembly partner Foxconn Technology Co. to offer geographic alternatives to its core China operations. Foxconn Tech, a major entity of the Foxconn Technology Group and a Sharp shareholder, made the connection between the two Japanese firms.Read more: Nintendo Adds Sharp as Assembler of Popular Switch ConsoleWhile Apple is diversifying its global supply chain, it’s also deepening its links with local Chinese manufacturers to serve the domestic market. Earlier this year, China’s Luxshare Precision Industry Co. struck a deal to acquire Wistron’s iPhone production facilities in the country, a move that will create the first mainland company to assemble Apple’s marquee handsets. Compatriot BYD Electronic International Co. is also now splitting iPad orders with Foxconn and Compal Electronics Inc., a person familiar with the matter said. AirPods orders, meanwhile, are now dominated by Luxshare and another compatriot, GoerTek Inc.It took Foxconn 30 years to build up its massive Chinese operations and India or any other region is unlikely to catch up overnight, Foxconn’s Liu said earlier this month.The supply chain shift will take time, “and China will remain a major electronics manufacturing hub for at least the next five years,” Gavekal’s Wang added.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-suppliers-exodus-china-won-220000376.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-23	2020-11-23 12:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Foxconn Plant Championed by Trump Lands Google Server Contract	(Bloomberg) -- Foxconn Technology Group plans to assemble key components for Google servers from its plant in Wisconsin, people familiar with the matter said, finally breathing life into a factory Donald Trump hailed as crucial to bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.The Taiwanese company has decided to locate production for this new contract at the existing complex rather than make the components at home or in China, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive move. The under-utilized factory should start mass production in the first quarter, timed with the release of Intel Corp.’s Ice Lake server chips, they said. Foxconn is setting up surface-mount technology assembly lines that it will use to place semiconductors onto circuit boards, they added.Foxconn, known also as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is one of several Taiwanese firms exploring ways to expand in America and lessen a reliance on Chinese production bases. The company has also sought to diversify a business that counts on Apple Inc. for half its revenue, including by courting more American clients. On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. won city-level incentives for a $12 billion chip plant in Phoenix, another step toward bringing high-tech manufacture back to the U.S. and addressing security concerns over the industry’s supply chain.Read more: TSMC Wins Approval From Phoenix for $12 Billion Chip PlantA Foxconn representative confirmed it’s developing data center infrastructure and high-performance computing “capabilities” in Wisconsin, but declined to name any customers.Taiwan counts Washington as an essential diplomatic, economic and military ally amid rising tensions with Beijing. Foxconn, which operates most of its factories in central and southern China, won Google’s business because it was the only contract manufacturer capable of establishing a surface-mount technology line on American soil, one of the people said. Shanghai-listed Foxconn Industrial Internet Co., its cloud business unit, will oversee the server business in Wisconsin, another person familiar with Foxconn’s operations said.The plant in Wisconsin was unveiled to much fanfare in 2018 by Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou and Trump, who called it “the Eighth Wonder of the World.” Once envisioned as the centerpiece of a Made in America effort that would create 13,000 jobs for the Badger State, it instead succumbed to delays and switched directions several times after local officials slashed subsidies. The company missed its first-year hiring target by a wide margin, ending 2018 with just 178 full-time employees. And rather than the promised large-sized display panels, it began churning out face masks and ventilators this year.Yet its location in the heart of America is now a boon to Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which is trying to win lucrative contracts for its server-dependent cloud business. The U.S. company considers it an important area for the company’s growth, but one in which Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. dominate. An American base could help Foxconn court U.S. government contracts, particularly as Washington ramps up scrutiny over a largely Chinese-focused global electronics supply chain.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/foxconn-plant-championed-trump-lands-120000562.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-11-19	2020-11-19 12:47:44	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Wins Phoenix City's Support For $12B Plant	Phoenix City authorities have agreed to support Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) chip-supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (NYSE: TSM), setting up a $12 billion chip manufacturing plant. In Wednesday's notice, the City Council authorized financing from its public infrastructure pool to support the project.What Happened: Phoenix city authorities expect that the Taiwanese chipmaker's advanced semiconductor fabrication campus could generate 1,900 new jobs over the next five years. Production is scheduled to begin in 2024.With the new plant in operation, the council estimates a direct economic contribution, in terms of output, of approximately $38.2 billion over the next 20-year period and a boost in annual personal income by $314 million.The council will fund roughly $205 million for infrastructure projects that support TSMC's plant. It will spend an estimated amount of $61 million on road connectivity, $37 million on public water infrastructure, and $107 million on sewers and public wastewater infrastructure.An on-site professional team will also be available in addition to this.Why Does It Matter: TSMC approached Phoenix City authorities with the project in May 2020. According to Bloomberg, outgoing-President Donald Trump's china-bashing and warnings over manufacturing electronics outside the U.S. did have a generic impact on the city council's decision.Separately, another Apple-supplier, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, Ltd (OTC: HNHPF) or Foxconn, engaged with Wisconsin State officials since 2017 for a $10 billion plant in the city, as per Apple Insider. However, the LCD manufacturing plant's fate was uncertain after a disagreement between state officials and Foxconn's management. Expectedly, Foxconn completed making its first batch of LCDs in a manufacturing plant in Vietnam.Price Action: TSM shares were 0.29% lower at $96.65 in the pre-market session on the last check Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * YouTube Will Run Ads On Some Creator Videos Without Sharing Revenue  * Starbucks Hikes US Barista Wages By 10% In Preparation For Biden Presidency: Report(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-19	2020-11-19 02:59:32	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC Wins Approval From Phoenix for $12 Billion Chip Plant	(Bloomberg) -- City officials in Phoenix, Arizona approved a slate of financial incentives and government support for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s planned $12 billion chip plant, a step toward bringing high-tech manufacturing to the U.S. and addressing national security concerns over the industry supply chain.The city agreed to provide about $200 million to develop roads, sewers and other infrastructure, according to a notice from the city council. At least one additional traffic light will be included for a cost of approximately $500,000. The company is conducting due diligence on several locations in Phoenix with a final decision to be made later.The decision to locate a plant in Arizona came after the Trump administration warned about the threat inherent in having much of the world’s electronics made outside of the U.S. TSMC, the primary chipmaker for companies like Apple Inc., had negotiated a deal with the administration to create American jobs and produce sensitive components domestically for national security reasons. The Phoenix project is projected to create about 1,900 new jobs over five years, the company said.“We appreciate the continuous bipartisan support from the U.S. federal, state and city governments,” a spokeswoman for the company said. “It gives TSMC and its supply chain partners the confidence this and other future investments will be successful.”TSMC has said that it hopes to convince its own suppliers to set up operations in the vicinity of its new fabrication facility over time. Chip giants Intel Corp. and Micron Technology Inc. already operate facilities in the western state and have helped build a vibrant local semiconductor industry over the years.TSMC had said that subsidies would be critical in setting up a fab in the U.S., given the additional expenses involved. While Phoenix has approved its infrastructure spending, TSMC is still waiting on state and federal subsidies and incentives that could surpass by far the city’s expenditures.A representative for the city council declined to comment beyond statements in public documents.“It is remarkable that this came to fruition during a pandemic,” said Mayor Kate Gallego in a statement. “The payoff is huge. TSMC will create 1,900 high-tech jobs and foster thousands more related jobs in the semiconductor supply chain ecosystem.”(Updates with company comment in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-wins-approval-phoenix-12-004020525.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-17	2020-11-17 01:02:06	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Samsung Intensifies Chip Wars With Bet It Can Catch TSMC by 2022	(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. is pouring $116 billion into its next-generation chip business that includes fabricating silicon for external clients, betting it can finally close the gap on industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. as soon as two years from now.South Korea’s biggest company will mass-produce 3-nanometer chips in 2022, a senior executive at its foundry division told attendees at an invite-only event last month. That target, which hasn’t previously been reported, means it’s on a path to start churning out the industry’s most advanced semiconductors the same year as its Taiwanese rival expects to pass that milestone. Samsung is already developing initial design tools with key partners, Park Jae-hong, executive vice president of foundry design platform development, told conference delegates.If Samsung succeeds, that will be a breakthrough for its ambition to become the chipmaker of choice for the likes of Apple Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. that now rely on foundries like TSMC. The business isn’t new to Samsung, which was the first manufacturer of Apple’s A-series iPhone processors, but the company’s renewed push is now shepherded by billionaire heir Jay Y. Lee, who wants to see it establish tech leadership across advanced sectors like chipmaking and 5G networking to power its next phase of growth. Park’s comments suggest Samsung is accelerating its bid to compete with iPhone-chipmaker TSMC, one of the biggest beneficiaries of this year’s wave of stay-at-home demand for personal electronics.“To actively respond to market trends and lower the design barrier for competitive systems-on-chip development, we’ll keep innovating our cutting-edge process portfolio, while strengthening Samsung’s foundry ecosystem through close collaboration with partners,” Samsung’s Park told attendees, according to people at the event.Read more: Samsung Takes Another Step in $116 Billion Plan to Take on TSMCSamsung’s aim is in line with TSMC’s target of offering volume production of 3nm chips in the second half of 2022. But the Korean company also hopes to go one better by adopting what’s known as the Gate-All-Around technique, regarded by some as game-changing technology that can more precisely control current flows across channels, shrink chip areas and lower power consumption. TSMC had opted for the more established FinFET structure for its 3nm lines.“Samsung is catching up to TSMC very fast and it seeks to achieve dominance over its competitor by adopting the new technology for the first time,” said Rino Choi, a professor of materials science and engineering at Inha University. “However, if Samsung can’t improve production yields of the advanced node fast in an initial stage, it may lose money.”Already the world’s largest maker of computer memory and displays, Samsung wants a bigger share of the $250 billion foundry and logic-chip industry that’s set for accelerated growth with the advent of artificial intelligence and fifth-generation wireless technology. In 2019, TSMC controlled more than half of the contract chipmaking market while Samsung had just 18%, according to TrendForce data.Lee has taken a close interest in the matter. He flew to ASML Holding NV’s headquarters in the Netherlands last month to discuss supply of its extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, gear that’s indispensable to the creation of the most advanced semiconductors. Other top executives have toured major cities from San Jose to Munich and Shanghai, hosting foundry forums and negotiating deals.Some analysts question Samsung’s ability to carve out a significant share of a market dominated by TSMC, which spends some $17 billion annually to ensure it remains at the forefront of both technology and sheer capacity. For its part, Samsung’s semiconductor division plans to spend $26 billion on capital expenditure in 2020, but that’s been largely in support of its dominant memory business and not all of its expertise in making memory is directly relevant to creating advanced logic chips.Processors are more complex to manufacture than memory and their production yields are harder to control and scale up in the same way. Foundry customers also require bespoke solutions, imposing another barrier to rapid expansion and also making Samsung dependent on customers’ designs. But the Korean giant can draw confidence from its work with Nvidia Corp., whose chief executive officer sung the praises of collaborating with Samsung on customizing the manufacturing process for its latest graphics card silicon.The risks and initial setup costs have whittled down the number of companies capable of even competing in the EUV-based chipmaking industry. Intel Corp. this year announced it’ll consider outsourcing production of its most important chips for the first time, highlighting the complexities of the business and leaving Samsung and TSMC as the two major competitors. While Samsung has scored some marquee customers, TSMC’s long-standing relationships with clients allow for better coordination on design and manufacturing, leading to superior yields, said Sanjeev Rana, an analyst at CLSA Securities Korea.“In terms of chip performance, Samsung and TSMC are neck and neck,” Rana said. “Most smartphone, high-performance computing, high-end server applications need leading-edge process fabrication for performance and power efficiency reasons. This is where the competition between TSMC and Samsung comes into the picture.”Read more: Behind Samsung’s $116 Billion Bid for Chip SupremacyThe Korean company is making rapid advances, in part because even with TSMC’s deep pockets, the Taiwanese chipmaker cannot expand capacity quickly enough to satisfy all demand. Customers also prefer to use more than one foundry, which also works to Samsung’s advantage. The Korean company has already secured enough orders from major clients to keep its currently most-advanced 5nm process lines busy for the next few years, a company executive told Bloomberg News. The electronics giant increased its roster of semiconductor clients by 30% last year, according to another official. In recent months, Nvidia and IBM Corp. are among those that turned to Samsung for some of their chipmaking needs, while Qualcomm Inc. has reportedly awarded the company a 1 trillion won ($858 million) contract to build its flagship mobile processors.Samsung started up its first dedicated plant for EUV-based fabrication in the southern city of Hwaseong this year, while a second facility in Pyeongtaek is slated for mass production in the second half of 2021. The growth rate of its foundry business is expected to significantly exceed that of the market, which is likely to be in the high single-digits, Shawn Han, senior vice president of the semiconductor business, said during a recent earnings call. The GAA technology that Samsung’s chosen is expected to be adopt by TSMC for 2nm processes in 2024, but there’s a chance that schedule could be moved up to the second half of 2023, said Kim Young-soo, an analyst at SK Securities.“Technically, Samsung could turn the table in 2023 before TSMC kicks off the 2nm production,” Kim said. “There will be overflow orders of making application processor chips and edge computing devices. The key to expand the market share is how many EUV machines Samsung can secure.”Officials at Samsung believe the company has a competitive edge from its experience building both the chips and the devices that they go into, like Galaxy smartphones. It can foresee and address the engineering requirements of its clients. Samsung believes its other trump card is an ability to package memory and logic chips into a single module, improving power and space efficiency. But some companies may be wary about outsourcing production to a direct competitor. TSMC executives have from time to time highlighted the fact that the Taiwanese chipmaker doesn’t compete with any of its customers, a clear jab at Samsung.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-intensifies-chip-wars-bet-010206283.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-05	2020-11-05 03:15:05	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Faces Shortages in Power Chips for iPhone 12	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is grappling with a shortage of vital chips that manage power consumption in iPhones and other devices, people with knowledge of the matter said, complicating its ability to meet holiday demand for the latest version of its marquee gadget.It’s unclear to what extent the bottleneck may limit iPhone availability during its crucial launch quarter, typically Apple’s busiest. Despite the shortfall, suppliers are likely to prioritize Cupertino, California-based Apple and its power-hungry iPhone 12 over other customers lining up for scarce parts, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.Increasing demand for silicon across a range of products and supply-chain disruptions from Covid-19 are the main causes of the shortage, according to the people. Main Apple chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said in October that 5G smartphones require 30% to 40% more chip content versus 4G. That and uncertainty over the course of the pandemic is spurring customers to cache components for fear of running out, especially after major smartphone maker Huawei Technologies Co. had stocked up massively ahead of a September deadline for U.S. sanctions.The stockpiling compounds lingering issues across a global electronics industry still recovering from rolling lockdowns that snarled transport routes and cut off workers from factories earlier this year. Disruptions are expected to persist over the next two quarters, the people said.Read more: Qualcomm Sees Booming Demand for 5G Phone ChipsPower management is more important in the iPhone 12 than for its predecessors given additional camera features and 5G capabilities, increasing Apple’s need for these components. It recently launched four 5G models and analysts expect strong consumer demand for the devices. During a recent conference call with analysts, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook warned about supply constraints for the iPhone 12, Mac, iPad and some Apple Watch models -- although he didn’t specifically mention power-management chips.Supply issues for the iPhone are “not a surprise” because Apple has just begun to ramp up production, the CEO said. “It’s hard to predict” how long the supply constraints will last, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.Apple has multiple power-management chip suppliers, according to a recent teardown from iFixit. The iPhone 12 Pro uses a component from Texas Instruments Inc. to control power to the camera system, along with a similar chip from STMicroelectronics NV and one from Qualcomm Inc. for the 5G modem.There’s also a power-management part designed by Apple in this handset. In 2018, Apple acquired technology and other assets from Dialog Semiconductor Plc for $600 million to build its own power-management chips.The disruption to iPhone production comes amid questions over Apple’s ability to galvanize demand for its newest gadget in China, following its worst quarterly revenue performance there since 2014. Investors are concerned the company is losing momentum to homegrown rivals like Huawei and Xiaomi Corp. in one of its most critical markets.In the U.S., a check of Apple’s website shows that new iPhone 12 Pro orders won’t arrive to customers until the end of November or early December, while the regular iPhone 12 isn’t showing any delay. Many iPad models are showing deliveries between mid-November and the end of the month, while some Apple Watch models are showing delivery times in late November.Read more: Amazon and Apple Eye Historic $100 Billion in Holiday Quarter(Updates with TSMC’s remarks on 5G content from the third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-faces-shortages-power-chips-013222824.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-30	2020-10-30 10:32:17	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Taiwanese Growth Rebounds on Export Boom and Domestic Stimulus	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan’s economy expanded at its fastest pace in more than two years, with the quick control of the Covid-19 pandemic and the benefits of U.S.-China competition combining to boost growth after a contraction earlier this year.Gross domestic product expanded 3.3% in the third quarter from a year ago, its fastest increase since June 2018, the statistics bureau said Friday. That was higher than even the most bullish forecast in a survey of economists. The median estimate was for growth of 1.1%.The government attributed the strong growth to a bigger-than-expected rise in exports, with a stimulus program also boosting private consumption, according to a statement.Taiwan joins South Korea and China in quickly shaking off the Covid-19 downturn, even as many of its other trading partners are still contracting. That recovery has been underpinned by a variety of factors, including export growth, a stronger currency, the quick control of the virus, and a voucher-based domestic stimulus program. But the pandemic’s resurgence in many parts of the world and uncertain global demand for technology could upend the rebound. “The fourth quarter will be a challenge,” said Tony Phoo, economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Taipei. “Will semiconductors and tech products still be capable of high growth? We’ll have to see whether the pandemic in the U.S. and Europe affects holiday consumption.”Taiwan has reported just 553 reported cases and only seven deaths, and on Thursday reached 200 days without a local infection. It’s never had to enforce a lockdown, limiting the damage to domestic consumption.Read more: Record 200 Days With No Local Case Makes Taiwan World’s EnvyTaiwan’s full-year growth could be 1.9%, according to Wu Pei-hsuan, a senior executive officer at the statistics department. However that forecast doesn’t take into account the second and third waves of Covid outbreaks seen in many countries around the world, Wu said at a briefing in Taipei. The government’s current official estimate is for GDP to expand 1.6%.“Whether you’re looking at foreign trade or consumption, it’s all looking quite positive,” Anita Hsu, an economist with Masterlink Securities Investment Advisory in Taipei, said in an interview Monday. “Domestic consumption appears to have picked up significantly, and the stimulus and tourism vouchers should be sufficient to offset some of the lost consumption from foreign tourists.”Local DemandGovernment assistance has helped businesses and stimulated demand. Taiwan has spent more than NT$150 billion ($5.2 billion) on relief measures so far and the legislature approved a NT$210 billion relief budget last week.With that help, domestic consumption rose 5.1% in the third quarter, the fastest pace since the government began releasing the data in 2011.Markets have also remained positive: Taiwan’s main stock exchange has been trading near its record high, and the Taiwan dollar is one of the best performing Asian currencies so far this year against the greenback, strengthening more than 4%.Taiwan has also benefited from conflict between the U.S. and China. Exports to China surged 22.3% in September, largely driven by demand from Huawei Technologies Co. prior to the U.S.-imposed ban on sales to the Chinese tech company taking effect in the middle of the month.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Huawei ban. The chipmaker, which accounts for 30% of the Taiwan Stock Exchange’s market capitalization, smashed estimates with a 36% y/y increase in net income in the third quarter.Huawei aside, demand connected to Apple Inc.’s new iPhone 12, people buying devices to work or study from home, and the global 5G transition have also been a boon for TSMC and other Taiwanese hardware companies. Restructuring of regional supply chains away from China has also been driving investment in Taiwan.Investment Inflow“The long-term capital outflow trend has been completely reversed,” President Tsai Ing-wen said in her National Day address on October 10. “Many foreign companies and well-known multinational corporations are also increasing their investments in Taiwan.”With tech exports expected to remain robust in the near future, sustaining domestic demand will be crucial to continuing the economic rebound.“It’s highly unlikely that Taiwan will open up to foreign travelers before the end of this year,” Carl Liu, economist at KGI Securities Investment Advisory Co, said before the data was released. “For private consumption to increase, it will come down to spending by ordinary Taiwanese.”(Updated with new economist quote in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-gdp-poised-rebound-buoyed-210000915.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-10-30	2020-10-30 03:30:24	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	In China, Big Tech Isn't the Enemy. It's the Strategy	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Beijing’s goal of building a self-reliant technology industry has been elevated to become a strategic pillar, part of the latest five-year plan setting out top national priorities. This means that China is redoubling efforts to wean itself off foreign companies, with the result likely to be a cohort of domestic giants and a slow freeze-out of overseas competitors.Just as the U.S. government starts looking to rein in, or even break up, big technology companies in the belief they have too much power, China is going in the opposite direction. We should expect to see more money, more policy favoritism, and more attention from party cadres aimed at ensuring the establishment of big successful chip and software firms.The Fifth Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party's 19th Central Committee wrapped up Thursday by tasking the nation to, among other things, develop self-reliance and build its technological power.The result will be a more insular approach to industry and trade as Beijing strengthens a robust domestic market for those up-and-coming heroes to ply their wares.Foreign companies — notably in semiconductors, software or materials — that still believe China is a viable long-term business are kidding themselves. Only those supplying crucial products and services not available locally will have any shot at sustained market access, and even then only until a domestic alternative comes along. Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. should take note. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. ought to be wary. Meanwhile, suppliers of the equipment, chemicals and software used to design and build chips should enjoy eating at the trough now, because the good times won’t last, if Beijing can help it.The likes of ASML Holding NV, Tokyo Electron Ltd., and Synopsys Inc. might see some growth years as Chinese companies lean on them to supply the core ingredients of a semiconductor industry, if the U.S. administration doesn’t get in their way to further stymie China’s advancement. But they’d be foolish to not understand that local rivals, backed by Beijing, are doing everything possible to replicate their products. Over the past decade, the government has done a lot to improve intellectual property enforcement and secure economic rights over technological innovation. Nonetheless, it would be a brave Chinese prosecutor or judge who sides with a big Western company over a local upstart in any case of alleged IP theft. I believe we’ve yet to see the next era of national champions emerge. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. have been the backbone of China’s internet development. Beijing would want to see their equivalents in semiconductors come forth. Huawei Technologies Co. fits the role, a fact that Washington recognizes by attempting to impede the Shenzhen company’s chip division HiSilicon. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. will also play a part, but after two decades it has still failed to match rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or United Microelectronics Corp. Then there’s a collection of state-backed chipmakers such as those in the orbit of the esteemed Tsinghua University.Yet the Alibaba of chips may not yet be born.It could be bubbling away in a small Shenzhen office, helmed by former HiSilicon execs determined not to give up their semiconductor dreams despite Washington’s pressure. Or the topic of Zoom calls among locked-down postgrads finishing up their American degrees and planning to return home. Or in the bank balance of a Taiwanese engineer, enticed by the promise of vast riches, after a decade of toiling away at TSMC.Whoever the next big Chinese tech giant is, you can be sure that Beijing has the money and determination to make sure it succeeds. At all costs. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-10-27	2020-10-27 21:31:48	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	AMD’s Lisa Su Redoubles Intel Challenge With Record Xilinx Deal	(Bloomberg) -- Lisa Su spent her first six years at the helm of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. turning around the troubled chipmaker. She slashed debt and oversaw products that launched on time and performed as advertised.Now she’s going beyond cleanup to challenge Intel Corp. for the lead in computer chips.The 51-year-old engineer -- among the few female CEOs in technology -- unveiled a $35 billion all-stock acquisition of Xilinx Inc. on Tuesday, one of the largest chip deals ever. In interviews and conference calls, Su made it clear there are few limits to her ambition.“We have an even bigger place in the industry over the next five years than we’ve had in the last five,” she said.Since taking over in 2014, Su has erased AMD’s reputation as an accident-prone supplier of cheap processors struggling to survive in Intel’s shadow -- something her predecessors failed to do spectacularly.Buying Xilinx, a maker of programmable silicon, will take AMD into new areas such as automotive and communications networking, while bolstering its offerings in the lucrative market for cloud data center components. If the transaction closes next year as planned, the company’s annual research-and-development budget will jump to more than $2.7 billion. That’s still small compared with Intel’s but it’s a crucial ingredient if AMD is going to seriously challenge the industry’s leaders.Born in Taiwan, Su graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in New York and got her Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She worked at companies including Texas Instruments Inc. and International Business Machines Corp., then arrived at AMD in 2012 as a senior vice president.An early success was getting AMD chips in the dominant gaming consoles, Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox One and Sony Corp.’s PlayStation. But most of her progress has come from a methodical focus on meeting customer demands -- a stark contrast to former AMD CEOs who were known for splashy product launches that often didn’t deliver.While she’s been involved in chip industry innovation, Su dislikes portrayals of her as a lab-bound technical genius, describing herself as an OK engineer. She says one of her main skills is the ability to understand engineers and help them make the best high-level decisions, not do the work for them.In her usual practical fashion, she presented the Xilinx deal to investors as a transaction that will improve AMD’s finances first and then transition the combined company to future technical leadership.“I haven’t talked a lot about M&A because I didn’t think there was a need to do M&A for M&A’s sake,” she said. “This is about what’s the next step for AMD and Xilinx is the best franchise in the industry.”The structure of the Xilinx transaction also shows the power of Su’s transformation. AMD shares have soared under her watch and the company is using that currency to pay for the acquisition. That will help Su avoid the heavy debt load that crippled AMD a decade ago.Read more: AMD Tries to Avoid Past Debt-Ridden Deal MistakesThe chip industry’s first female chief executive now wants her company to be more than just another supplier of components. She sees Xilinx helping AMD set the industry’s agenda by defining new technology, something that’s mostly been the preserve of Intel in computing for half a century.Getting to this position hasn’t been easy. When Su took the top job, she was AMD’s fourth CEO in a decade. The company had lost money in six of those 10 years as products either launched late, performed below expectations or had to be fixed later. That left AMD with less than 1% of the lucrative server chip market, down from a peak of 26%.Prior to the Xilinx deal, Su’s most public expression of ambition was to regain that 26% market share. When discussing AMD’s future, she would fall back on her standard refrain of “consistent execution” -- creating a company that delivers what it promises.One of her biggest decisions in 2018 has helped Su keep her promises and set the stage for AMD’s next chapter. The company outsourced production of its best chips to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Soon after, TSMC overtook Intel in production technology. Now AMD’s processors are often as capable as Intel’s -- sometimes better. When she announced the Xilinx agreement, Su was careful to point out that her acquisition target also relies on TSMC’s production prowess.Read the Bloomberg 50 profile: Lisa Su, AMD’s David to Intel’s GoliathIntel still dwarfs AMD. The world’s largest chipmaker has an annual R&D budget of more than $10 billion and is expected to make a profit of $21 billion this year -- more than double AMD’s revenue.But Intel is making Su’s job easier. The company is going through an unprecedented series of stumbles with its once peerless manufacturing. It’s only just started shipping large numbers of chips made with a production technique called 10 nanometer, more than three years late. AMD and its customers are already enjoying the benefits -- price, performance and power efficiency -- of a more advanced type of manufacturing known as 7 nanometer.That type of technical leadership helped persuade Xilinx Chief Executive Officer Victor Peng to join Su.“We had a great path as a standalone company,” said Peng, who will become AMD president and continue to run the Xilinx business. “We looked at the landscape and we thought about this carefully. This is about choosing to be part of an even greater company -- which is AMD.”(Updates with photo of CEO after fourth paragraph and link to Businessweek profile.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-lisa-su-redoubles-intel-213148539.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-26	2020-10-26 03:47:14	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Samsung's Lee Built a Global Name, Not a Global Company	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Lee Kun-hee turned Samsung into a household name and a global brand. But he never really managed to transform Samsung Electronics Co. into a truly international company. Samsung, the name, can be found across all corners of the globe. And inside almost every device on the planet — stamped on memory and storage chips, as well as display screens. That’s thanks to Lee, who died at 78 over the weekend after many years of hospitalization and a diminishing role in his empire’s operation.A bonfire he lit in the 1990s, literally from electronics products that didn’t meet his standards, is emblematic of Lee’s determination to build a global top-tier brand known for quality. Today it’s the world’s most ubiquitous electronics label, besting Japanese archrival Sony Corp.Samsung’s transformation coincided with, or perhaps even helped shape, South Korea’s own move away from autocratic and military leadership into a more democratic, open nation run by a civilian leader. Seoul had just hosted the Olympics and the world was on the cusp of the computer and internet revolutions. In the 1990s, the company went even deeper into memory chips, a business that industry pioneer Intel Corp. moved away from a decade earlier. That decision underpins Samsung's technological strength to this day.Yet from a management perspective, Lee and his son Jay Y. Lee were busy building an inward-looking empire. Its board and executive ranks are stacked almost exclusively with Koreans while outsiders rarely get a word in. When Paul Elliot Singer’s Elliott Management Corp. took a stake in affiliate Samsung C&T Corp., local prosecutors responded with an investigation into a possible breach of disclosure rules. It eventually dropped the case without indictment, but the point had been made.This kind of insularism, like the chaebol system itself, isn’t healthy and stands as the biggest risk to Samsung’s longevity. American technology companies have been able to survive, and ride out crises, with globally diverse management teams and a willingness to engage outside views. If Lee’s successors want to solidify the South Korean giant’s future, their massive inheritance tax bill may be the catalyst. The nation’s 50% levy means his estate, likely to include the younger Lee and current de-facto leader, will be on the hook for around $10 billion of his father’s $20.7 billion fortune. Samsung itself has three times that figure in cash on hand. But that’s shareholder money, and the tax bill ought to be paid out of the estate. The Lee family will need to raise the funds itself, and a sale of Samsung Electronics stock is the most likely solution.In this way, a forced sale may end up being a blessing for Samsung’s shareholders and a chance to build a new future.Of course, there are alternatives, which include borrowing against those shares or selling family assets, including stakes in other companies. There’s also the expectation that Samsung may boost its dividend (it can afford to), which would offer a cash injection to the Lee family. The patriarch only owned around 4.2% of Samsung and maintained control through a complicated network of subsidiaries, par for the course among the nation’s chaebol. While a 2% share sale in open markets is feasible, it would take time and possibly depress the share price.Instead, the Lee family should shop around for a buyer directly — one that can help turn the company more global.Right now, Samsung is 54% foreign-owned. Yet the lion’s share of that stake is in its Seoul-traded common stock. Its London-traded depositary receipts are worth only $24 billion, or just 7.5% of its market capitalization. By comparison, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s New York-traded receipts are valued at $94 billion, equal to 23% of market value, according to Bloomberg Data. Samsung’s business is also overweight South Korea, at 15% of revenue, while the nation’s economy is just outside the top 10 globally and accounts for less than 2% of world GDP. An easy solution would be to hold a New York listing. The Lee family could offload the required stake, and Samsung could raise more funds. But a preferred approach would be to invite a strategic investor to join its shareholder ranks, and even its board. It would be a beautiful irony if Elliott were to be that candidate given their history. Intel or Nvidia Corp. might be a better choice.Intel is struggling right now, as my colleague Tae Kim noted, yet it has lots of cash and could surely raise more. It also has an uncanny ability to reform itself when under pressure — witness the move into server chips when desktop PC sales slowed. The two could even team up to take on their nemesis: TSMC. Nvidia would be an even better partner. The fabless chip designer is a global hero right now thanks to its gallop into artificial intelligence. However, I admit the prospects for such an investment are dim given that it’s planning to buy Arm Ltd. in a deal that’s already facing regulatory scrutiny. Other candidates include Huawei Technologies Co. or, to be truly edgy, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Group.As the world remembers Lee Kun-hee’s legacy for creating a global brand, it’s time for his successors to start their own legacy of building a global company.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-10-23	2020-10-23 05:04:33	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Huawei’s Latest Phone Marks End of Era As U.S. Spurs Rethink	(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. introduced the Mate 40 smartphone series on Thursday, potentially its last major release powered by its self-designed Kirin chips.China’s biggest tech company by sales has been stockpiling chips to get its signature device out in time to compete with Apple Inc.’s iPhone 12 over the holidays. Huawei will have to overhaul its smartphone lineup after Trump administration sanctions that took effect in September curtailed its ability to design and manufacture advanced in-house chips by cutting it off from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.The company’s consumer devices group, led by Richard Yu, was already prevented from shipping handsets with the full Google-augmented Android experience. But that didn’t stop it from surpassing Samsung Electronics Co. to become the world’s best-selling smartphone maker in the summer, largely on the strength of growing domestic sales. Without a contractor to produce its own chips or the ability to buy processors from a supplier like Qualcomm Inc., prognostications for the division’s future are less rosy.“We are suffering from the U.S. government’s third-round ban. This unfair ban,” said Yu during a live-streamed presentation, saying the trade sanctions make things extremely difficult. Though he did open the event by saying that, “at Huawei, we continue to dare to dream for a bright future together.”Read more: Huawei Outhustles Trump by Hoarding Chips Vital for China 5GHuawei’s third-quarter revenue growth slowed to 3.7% as the sanctions exacted a toll on the consumer business, of which the Mate series is the showpiece.The 6.5-inch Mate 40 and 6.76-inch Mate 40 Pro feature the 5nm Kirin 9000 processor, second to Apple’s A14 chip to offer that advanced manufacturing node in consumer devices. The system-on-chip contains 15.3 billion transistors, including eight CPU cores maxing out at a speed of 3.13GHz and 24 GPU cores that Huawei claims give it 52% faster graphics than Qualcomm’s best offering.Both devices have sloping glass sides and in-display fingerprint sensors. The new rear “Space Ring” design accommodating Huawei’s multi-camera system is reminiscent of the control wheel of iPods of yesteryear. It plays host to a 50-megapixel main camera accompanied by zoom and ultrawide lenses.Though prevented from doing business with technological partners and suppliers, Huawei still touts Leica co-branding on its imaging hardware and is once again offering a Porsche Design edition of its new flagship smartphone. The company also announced a new pair of over-ear headphones and new home speakers in collaboration with French audio brand Devialet SA.Huawei is the leader in China, where the mobile software ecosystem is fleshed out with vendor-specific apps and stores alongside a reliance on Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat super-app as a mini operating system. The Mate 40 gives Huawei a response to Apple’s new 5G-enabled iPhones and extends the period of time before it has to completely rethink its consumer devices strategy.The Mate 40 will be on sale for 899 euros ($1,064), Mate 40 Pro will cost 1,199 euros and a Mate 40 Pro Plus with further upgrades will cost 1,399 euros, though Huawei didn’t specify a release date.(Updates with quarterly results in the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-announces-last-major-phone-134407927.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-10-23	2020-10-23 00:11:18	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Huawei Outhustles Trump by Hoarding Chips Vital for China 5G	(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. quietly spent months racing to stockpile critical radio chips ahead of Trump administration sanctions, ensuring it can keep supplying Chinese carriers in their $170 billion rollout of 5G technology through at least 2021.Partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. began ramping up output in late 2019 of Huawei’s 7-nanometer Tiangang communications chips, the most crucial element in 5G base stations, people familiar with the matter said. The Taiwanese contract manufacturer eventually shipped more than 2 million units at Huawei’s behest ahead of the sanctions cutoff last month, one of the people said, asking not be identified discussing internal matters. The sheer magnitude of orders at one point got TSMC executives wondering whether they had underestimated global demand, the person said.Huawei’s breakthrough in securing essential supplies underscores the mixed success of a U.S. campaign against China’s largest tech company since 2018. Citing national security concerns, the White House started by trying to curtail the sale of American software and circuitry to Huawei before finally enacting sweeping restrictions against its suppliers including TSMC. It’s that last salvo, a ban on the sale of ready-made, commercially available semiconductors, that finally knee-capped Huawei’s smartphone business and forced it to curtail device production, the people said. Representatives for Huawei and TSMC declined to comment.But the Tiangang chip, designed inhouse by secretive division HiSilicon, has proven pivotal to keeping the 5G business afloat. Huawei had leaned on TSMC in the months before Washington shut that loophole and it can now continue to supply China Mobile Ltd., China Telecom Corp. and China Unicom -- the carrier trio now aggressively building out a nationwide 5G network Beijing considers instrumental to driving the world’s No. 2 economy. A China Mobile representative declined to comment for this story. A China Telecom spokesperson said the company will communicate any impact from curbs on Huawei but declined to comment on discussions about chip supply. Unicom representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment.“The U.S. has demonstrated an intense will to restrict Huawei’s ability to offer 5G technologies. The U.S. government’s assertions of extraterritoriality have made it more difficult for Huawei to maintain access to critical components,” said Dan Wang, an analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics. In 2012, just a third of Huawei’s revenue was generated in China -- that closed in on two-thirds last year. “Huawei is more dependent on domestic sales due to both U.S. pressure as well as its strong hold over the fast-growing China market.”How Huawei Landed at the Center of Global Tech Tussle: QuickTakeHuawei told Chinese wireless operators its component inventory was fully capable of supporting base station construction in 2021 and beyond despite U.S. sanctions, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has started shipping 5G base stations without American components since at least the end of last year.It’s unclear how long those stocks can last. Rotating Chairman Guo Ping said last month the company has “sufficient” inventory for its communications equipment business. But it’s seeking supplies for the smartphone unit, which on Thursday unveiled potentially its last major phone before a shortage of components forces a rethink of the device lineup. “We are suffering from the U.S. government’s third-round ban. This unfair ban,” consumer business chief Richard Yu said during a live-streamed presentation.Even assuming Huawei has cached enough silicon for Chinese carrier clients’ purposes, it may have had to make sacrifices in performance because of shortages in second-tier components. Resorting to less-sophisticated local alternatives may hinder areas such as power consumption rate, the people said. To rectify that, Huawei’s promised to compensate carriers for part of that additional electricity expense, they said. A typical 5G base station consumes roughly four times the power of a standard 4G model.Read more: Shunned by U.S., Huawei Winning China’s $170 Billion 5G RaceWhat Bloomberg Intelligence SaysGains made by China’s tech leaders may be larger than prior generations for smartphones, cellular base stations, servers and chipsets, but less relevant amid the trade dispute. Huawei and peers face similar circumstances if the U.S. restricts their IP use, but may still grow in China via vertical integration. The nation’s tech trajectory might then veer away from global trends.\- Anand Srinivasan and Charles Shum, analystsClick here for the research.While Washington is gaining ground in efforts to pressure allies from Australia to the U.K. to shun Huawei equipment, the Chinese company’s main source of income remains its own home country. Huawei has so far won more than half of the 5G orders from state-owned carriers this year, securing contracts worth billions of dollars, Bloomberg News reported earlier.Chinese carriers have built 690,000 5G base stations since the technology was commercialized about a year ago, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The nation’s carriers have yet to announce base station procurement plans for 2021, but ministry officials said the country’s network buildup will continue over the next three years.(Updates with consumer chief’s comments from the seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-outhustles-trump-stockpiling-chips-090000625.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-10-22	2020-10-22 23:43:21	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Tumbles on Data Center Sales Decline, Tepid Forecast	(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. shares slumped after a surprise drop in data center sales and a tepid forecast added to concern that the company is losing its lead in computer chips.The data center business, a major source of Intel profit, suffered a 10% decline in third-quarter revenue compared with a year earlier after a weak economy hurt sales to large companies and government customers. Sales to cloud computing providers will slow in the current period, Intel said.Falling prices and narrowing profit margins reinforced concern that Intel is losing its lead in chip manufacturing technology, exposing the company to the strongest competition it has faced in more than a decade.During a conference call, Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said he’s still deciding how much production to outsource. Executives also said the Covid-19 pandemic increased demand for cheaper chips and predicted those headwinds will pass.Cody Acree, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets, said he didn’t accept Intel’s use of the pandemic as a reason for the quarterly revenue decline, citing a boost in demand for PCs during the past few months that wouldn’t have occurred otherwise.“I didn’t hear any answers to the biggest questions,” Acree said.Intel’s stock fell about 10% in extended trading. The company projected that fourth-quarter sales will decline at their worse rate in more than a decade. Gross margin, a key indicator of profitability, will end 2020 below 60% for the first time in seven years, according to Intel’s forecast.Intel experienced a very different third quarter compared with its expectations entering the period, Chief Financial Officer George Davis said. “We saw a big change in our data center demand profile with enterprise and government dropping 47% year over year after being up 30% for two consecutive quarters.”Average selling prices for Intel’s data center chips dropped 15% from a year earlier, suggesting competition is rising in a lucrative market that the company has long dominated.Intel is in the midst of its worst crisis in at least a decade. The company has been the largest chipmaker for most of the past 30 years by combining the best designs with cutting-edge factories. Most other U.S. chip companies shut or sold plants and tapped other firms to make the components. Intel held out, arguing that doing both improved each side of its operation and created better semiconductors. That strategy is being questioned now.Revenue in the current period will be about $17.4 billion, the Santa Clara, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. That was in line with the average analyst prediction, but would mean sales drop 14% from a year ago.Read more: Intel ‘Stunning Failure’ Heralds End of Era for U.S. Chip SectorThe results put more pressure Swan. If Thursday’s after-hours stock slump carries into Friday trading, the company’s last two quarterly results will have wiped out more than a fifth of its market value. Before the latest report, the stock had lost about 10% this year compared with a 28% gain for the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.In July, the CEO announced delays Intel’s 7-nanometer chip-production process. Its predecessor, 10 nanometer, is only now becoming mainstream after being initially promised for 2017. Production techniques play a crucial role in the performance of processors and what it costs to make them. Intel had led the $400-billion chip industry in this area for three decades. Now rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. can get products made with more advanced techniques by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.Swan is trying win back investor confidence by selling businesses, replacing some technology leaders and trying to push Intel’s current products into new markets. The CEO and his finance chief maintained that Intel is not facing any more competition than had been expected and will regain share in some markets.They told analysts on the conference call that they will decide early next year whether to push forward with in-house 7-nanometer chip production or outsource it. Swan said it will probably be a mixture of the two. Economics, timing and the performance of chips will determine their decision, the executives said.Third-quarter profit, excluding some items, was $1.11 a share and sales came in at $18.3 billion, down 4% from a year earlier. Analysts were looking for $1.10 a share on revenue of $18.2 billion.(Updates with profitability decline in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-tumbles-data-center-sales-210754442.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-10-22	2020-10-22 17:42:36	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	The U.S.-China Conflict Over Chips Is About to Get Uglier	(Bloomberg) -- On a scorching hot day in late August, representatives of Taiwan’s government and industry crowded into the clinical cool of a state-of-the-art semiconductor facility for a symbolic moment in the global tech conflict.They were attending the opening ceremony for a training center built by Dutch company ASML Holding at a cost of about $16 million, small change for an industry used to spending $10 billion or more on a single advanced manufacturing plant.The real value of the site in the southern city of Tainan is strategic: It’s one of just two such facilities outside the Netherlands capable of training semiconductor engineers to fabricate cutting-edge chips on ASML machines. Fellow U.S. ally South Korea hosts the other — and Washington is working hard to ensure China never acquires the same technology.  As the U.S.-China confrontation takes root, the ability to craft chips for everything from artificial intelligence and data centers to autonomous cars and smartphones has become an issue of national security, injecting government into business decisions over where to manufacture chips and to whom to sell them. Those tensions could kick into overdrive as Communist Party leaders set a five-year plan that includes developing China’s domestic technology industry, notably its chip capabilities.Semiconductors made from silicon wafers mounted with billions of microscopic transistors are the basic component of modern digital life and the building blocks of innovation for the future. They are arguably one of the world’s most important industries, with sales of $412 billion last year; scale that up to the electronics industry that depends on chips, and it’s worth some $5.2 trillion globally, according to German manufacturers.Politics is roiling that business model, sparking a drive for more autonomy from the U.S. to China, Europe and Japan. “We’re in a new world where governments are more concerned about the security of their digital infrastructure and the resiliency of their supply chains,” said Jimmy Goodrich, vice president of global policy with the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association. “The techno-nationalist trends gaining traction in multiple capitals around the world are a challenge to the semiconductor industry.”At once highly globalized and yet concentrated in the hands of a few countries, the industry has choke points that the U.S. under the presidency of Donald Trump has sought to exploit in order to thwart China’s plans to become a world leader in chip production.Washington says Beijing can only achieve that goal through state subvention at the expense of U.S. industry, while furthering Communist Party access to high-tech tools for surveillance and repression. China rejects the allegations, accusing the U.S. of hypocrisy and acting out of political motivation.For both sides, Taiwan, which is responsible for some 70% of chips manufactured to order,  is the new front line.Beijing is increasingly hostile toward Taiwan, a democratically governed island it regards as its territory. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s status as the world’s largest contract chipmaker — a trend taking over the industry — the go-to supplier for Apple Inc. and the focus of next-generation chip-making, adds another dimension to China’s enmity, and to its standoff with the U.S.TSMC has become “turf that all geopolitical players want to secure,” founder Morris Chang said in November.Just a couple of kilometers from the new training center, cranes dot a massive construction site where TSMC is building “fabs” in which it will manufacture the most advanced chips in the world — chips that are no longer available to China’s Huawei Technologies due to U.S. export controls. Huawei used to be TSMC’s second-largest customer, accounting for 14% of sales; those shipments stopped in September.The White House has also imposed export restrictions on China’s largest chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., having already squashed Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., once among Beijing’s biggest hopes to climb the chip ladder. The U.S. is also reaching out to key players at home and abroad to ask them to reconsider their relations with China.  China’s intentions are so alarming to America because chips can be dual-use items with military applications, according to a former official familiar with the U.S. administration’s efforts. “They are the fundamental basis of our qualitative military advantage, from missiles to radars to submarines,” the official said.After decades when the industry was encouraged to go global, Trump is attempting to reel it back home. The CHIPS for America Act introduced to Congress in June aims to set up incentives to support semiconductor manufacturing and research in the U.S.One executive at a Chinese semiconductor company, asking not to be named due to commercial and political sensitivities, said three of its deals had been aborted because of concerns raised by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, which reviews the national security implications of transactions. Germany has also been effectively cut off, making any deals very difficult, the person said.China “firmly opposes the unjustified suppression” of its companies by the U.S. “under the weakest pretext of national security,” and will continue to defend them, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters in late September.China — the world’s biggest semiconductor market, accounting for more than 50% of all chips sold — isn’t standing by as its high-tech ambitions are kneecapped. That outsized demand means many major deals need Beijing’s sign-off: Qualcomm gave up its pursuit of NXP Semiconductors in 2018 after failing to win approval from China.China’s five-year plan for the chip industry will lend it the same strategic importance Beijing gave to its atomic bomb program. What's more, a law passed Oct. 17 may allow China to hit back at the U.S., with speculation that it could prompt export controls on rare earths used in chip production.Still, the rolling restrictions imposed by Trump haven’t just hit China’s chip capabilities but are upending the entire industry. And there’s scant sign of a climbdown, whoever wins the U.S. election in November.   Citing the need to promote “digital sovereignty,” the European Commission is exploring a 30 billion-euro ($35 billion) drive to raise Europe’s share of the world chip market to 20%, from less than 10% now.  Japan is also looking to bolster its domestic capacity. At least one Japanese delegation traveled to Taiwan in May and June this year in the hope of convincing TSMC to invest in Japan, a person with knowledge of the visit said. But TSMC announced in May that it was building a $12 billion facility in Arizona, and the company declined to receive any foreign visitors seeking to woo it, said another person familiar with the company’s thinking. Both asked not to be named discussing corporate strategy.Meanwhile South Korea, home to Samsung, the No. 1 memory chipmaker, is striving for more self-reliance after Japan imposed export curbs last year on chemicals used in semiconductor manufacture during a flare-up in the countries’ tensions over Japan’s wartime past.While the U.S. remains dominant with giants like Intel Corp and Qualcomm and a virtual monopoly on the software essential to chip design, “there’s no region in the world that can proclaim strategic autonomy in semiconductors,” said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of the Technology and Geopolitics project at Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung. “Take out any of these players and the value chain falls down.”In January, days before Trump signed an initial trade deal with China, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo sat down for dinner with around 30 CEOs in Silicon Valley. He was the guest of Keith Krach, a 30-year veteran of the tech scene who was appointed undersecretary for economic growth in June 2019.Pompeo had a message for them: China’s Communist Party “is a threat to your companies because they don’t want to compete, they want to put you out of business,” Krach recalled him saying, he told a virtual conference of the German Marshall Fund of the United States on Sept. 29.Trump may have weaponized the semiconductor value chain, but it was the Obama administration that first acted on the threat posed by China, unveiling a semiconductor strategy in January 2017 as one of its last acts. Trump picked up the baton, but the nature of the supply chain means that others are in the U.S. line of sight.Israel — a high-tech R&D hub where Intel is the largest private employer — exported semiconductors worth about $2.1 billion last year, with about half going to China, data compiled by UN Comtrade shows.That closeness to China risks becoming a liability. Zvika Orron, a partner at Israel’s Viola Ventures who leads semiconductor investing, said there’s a hesitancy on the Israeli side to look to China because of worry that Chinese funding could imperil future U.S. deals. Carice Witte, founder of the SIGNAL nonprofit focused on Israel-China ties, said the U.S. is bound to “start asking more questions.”The U.K. is another pinch point thanks to Arm Ltd., whose instruction set — the basic code that allows chips to communicate with software — underlies everything from smartphones to the world’s fastest supercomputer. Arm currently sells to China, but the company’s takeover by Nvidia Corp puts that business in doubt. If the $40 billion deal wins regulatory approval, Arm would become part of an American company, a development that has provoked concerns it would be even more subject to U.S. export controls. Nvidia and Arm have said the change of control won’t alter its status in that regard. While the U.K. government has yet to show its hand, it allowed the sale of Arm to Softbank of Japan in 2016, so wouldn’t normally be expected to intervene now. But the newly strategic nature of the industry has prompted lawmakers to call for a review of the deal’s implications. Here too there are concerns at being caught between the U.S. and China.Losing a world-class technology company to the U.S. for the Department of Justice to “weaponize” is not a good place to be, according to a person with knowledge of British national security considerations. The risk, they said, is a U.K. strategic asset becomes “recognized as part of the U.S. arsenal” in its campaign against China.Over the Taiwan Strait on mainland China, the mood at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference in Nanjing in late August was gloomy. Chinese executives worried what the Trump administration might do next to hobble Beijing’s progress.“The conflict remains very fluid, which makes it impossible to predict what next moves both sides are going to take,” said Huang Yan, application and sales director at Senodia Technology, a Shanghai-based chip design company that develops sensor chips for smartphones.China is on course to import $300 billion of semiconductors for the third straight year, underscoring its dependence on U.S. technology. That’s something President Xi Jinping is determined to end.Xi has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies from artificial intelligence to wireless networks. A focus of Beijing is to accelerate research into so-called third-generation semiconductors — circuits made of materials such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, a fledgling technology where no country dominates.Yet without silicon capabilities it will be difficult for China to build a proper semiconductor industry, said a senior TSMC official. Another person from a company involved in third-generation chip production said designing them is an art, and even poaching a team of designers won’t necessarily guarantee success.The consensus is it won’t be easy for China to catch up, especially at the cutting-edge where TSMC and Samsung are producing chips whose circuits are measured in single-digit nanometers, or billionths of a meter. SMIC would have to double annual research spending in the next two-to-three years just to prevent its technology gap with those companies widening, says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum.The tussle raises the prospect of a broader decoupling of the global industry with two distinct supply chains. As with 5G, the question then becomes one of the extent of each system: Does China’s high-tech gravity pull in Southeast Asia and parts of Europe, or is it confined to its immediate neighborhood? How many allies will side with the U.S.?To be sure, the chip industry is still thriving, with the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up about 30% this year. Geopolitics is now a feature of boardrooms, said the SIA’s Goodrich, but 5G and AI are likely to cause more market upheaval.The direction of travel still worries key players. Shares of Micron Technology Inc., the largest U.S. chipmaker, fell in September after it was forced to halt shipments to Huawei, its biggest customer.Complete decoupling would harm U.S. competitiveness and hurt China, raising the prospect of less money for R&D, slowing innovation, said Goodrich. “A world in which the U.S. and China are independent from one another is a negative outcome for everyone.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-china-conflict-over-chips-230112790.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-10-22	2020-10-22 13:56:03	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Analyzing Taiwan Semiconductor's Unusual Options Activity	"Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) shares experienced unusual options activity on Thursday. The stock price moved up to $88.12 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-04-16  * Strike Price: $90.00  * Volume: 905  * Open Interest: 16058Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Taiwan Semiconductor: Q3 Earnings Insights  * Earnings Scheduled For October 15, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Shares have fallen just over 9% in 2020, buffeted by the Covid-19 pandemic in March as much of the market was, but then punished once again in late July after it disclosed a further delay in its next major new chip manufacturing technique.  The embarrassing disclosure in July triggered something of a reverse, as much smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices (ticker: AMD) stock gained roughly the amount  (INTC) (INTC) lost.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/70f2e51b-8449-3430-aa4c-5dce37a71c68/intel-reports-earnings.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-10-21	2020-10-21 22:47:25	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Lobbies for Lower Taxes to Boost U.S. Chip Production	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has been lobbying the U.S. government on tax breaks to support domestic chip production, suggesting the iPhone maker is keen to move more of its supply chain to the U.S.In second- and third-quarter disclosure reports, the company said it lobbied officials from the Treasury Department, Congress and the White House on tax topics including “issues related to tax credits for domestic semiconductor production.”Since releasing its first custom processor in 2010, chips have become a major performance differentiator for Apple. The company designs some of these components in house, but outsources production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Many other parts for Apple devices are made in China. That has exposed the company to import tariffs and other risks from a trade war between the U.S. and China. Taiwan, where TSMC operates, has also become an increasing focus of geopolitical tension between China and the U.S.Apple’s recent lobbying coincides with a push by the company and its partners to move some production away from China and even back to the U.S. in a few cases. There’s also a broader effort by the U.S. semiconductor industry to get government support for increased domestic production.Apple’s U.S. lobbying efforts are now mostly led by company veteran Tim Powderly, who was promoted around the time Cynthia Hogan, Apple’s prior top U.S. lobbyist, left to join former vice president Joe Biden’s campaign. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.Read more: Chip Industry Wants $50 Billion to Keep Manufacturing in U.SEarlier this year, TSMC said it would build a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona, and the company has been lobbying officials there for tax breaks.In 2013, Apple started making a low-volume Mac Pro computer in the U.S. Last year, it started using the same plant in Texas to conduct final assembly for a new version. That decision came after the company was granted breaks on tariffs.Apple also sources components from several chipmakers that build some of their products in the U.S., including Broadcom Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc. Apple also has started using Qualcomm Inc. again for iPhone modems, and the San Diego, California-based chipmaker builds some products domestically via production partner Global Foundries.Intel Corp., the current maker of the Mac’s main processors, builds some of its chips in the U.S. However, when Apple moves to its own Mac chips next month, that will mean shifting production of that component to Taiwan.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-lobbies-lower-taxes-boost-224725622.html?.tsrc=rss

In our view, investing in international income stocks is one way to increase portfolio diversification while reducing sensitivity to volatile U.S interest rates. Investing in overseas stocks carries its own set of risks, including the impact of currency exchange and geopolitical turmoil. But there are also a number of positives in this segment for U.S. investors. One is a more robust selection of high-quality names. Yields also tend to be higher in overseas markets in general.

2020-10-20	2020-10-20 00:46:11	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Agrees to Sell Storage Unit to SK Hynix for $9 Billion	(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. agreed to sell its Nand memory unit to South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. for about $9 billion, part of a broader effort by the U.S. chipmaker to concentrate on its main business.The Asian company will pay 10.3 trillion won for the Intel unit, which makes flash memory components for computers and other devices. The acquisition, which will take place in stages through 2025, includes Intel’s solid-state drive, Nand flash and wafer businesses, as well as a production facility in the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian. Hynix’s shares rose as much as 4.8% Tuesday morning.The deal will shore up the Korean corporation’s position in a business that’s boomed in the wake of Covid-19, which drove online activity and demand for internet computing. Hynix, Samsung Electronics Co. and Micron Technology Inc. together dominate the market for the memory chips used in everything from Apple Inc.’s iPhones to data centers.Intel has said for months it was exploring options for the flash group. Hynix however won’t be buying the Optane division, which develops chips that can permanently store data and read and write it faster than NAND -- if not faster than traditional DRAM. The product, which went on sale in 2018, was tested successfully by some large cloud providers and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. used the technology to support its massive Singles’ Day sales. Bob Swan, Intel’s chief executive officer, described Optane as “something special” last year.The Korean company said it will pay Intel $7 billion before the end of 2021, then the rest by March 2025.Read more: Intel ‘Stunning Failure’ Heralds End of Era for U.S. Chip SectorThe acquisition also further streamlines Intel’s struggling empire. Since taking over in 2019, Swan has looked to sell several units that aren’t part of the company’s focus on processors for personal computers and servers.The Santa Clara, California-based company has delayed production of important upcoming chip lines and now lags behind some industry players in manufacturing technology. Its shares are down about 9% so far this year, while the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up almost 29%.Despite the delays, the company’s server group has been performing well. Shedding another non-core business could help Intel focus on fixing its chip technology woes.Intel unloaded its smartphone cellular modem group to Apple in 2019 and this year sold its home connectivity chips group to MaxLinear Inc. In July, the company said it was considering moving away from manufacturing its own chips, potentially benefiting contract producers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung.Read more: Intel’s Latest Chip Push Suggests the Company Has a Short Memory(Updates with deal details from the second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-agrees-sell-storage-unit-000003270.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-16	2020-10-16 13:28:12	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	4 Semiconductor Stocks Making the Guts of Everything Electronic	"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had its minor moment in the media earlier this week as it presented more of its iPhones. The phones are finally catching up with bigger competitors such as Samsung Electronics (SSNLF,005930 Korea), Xiaomi (OTCMKTS:XIACY) and ZTE (OTCMKTS:ZTCOY) by containing transmission chips and software to operate on fifth-generation (5G) wireless standards. 5G is not really in the U.S. yet, but is increasingly in China and South Korea. But the company is at least trying to be relevant.
Behind the glass and painted cases of modern phones are a host of semiconductors that the company had little to do with in creating or producing. Like for most of Apple products, they do the marketing — others do the work.
But it is a good news peg to discuss the semiconductor chips that are so vital for the world’s electronic gadgets, as well as everything else from our cars to planes and even the refrigerator in your kitchen.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Everyone tends to focus on the big brand names in technology, not the companies that do the grunt work to make the guts of modern products. Hence companies like Apple get lots of headlines and companies that I am presenting to you include some that aren’t household names. They should be, though, if you are investing in more of the new-new things coming to the market.
Founders
Semiconductors, or chips, are firmly in the vernacular of technology investors. But I would argue that not many understand the process of getting from silicon to the finished product that makes a gadget work when you hit the power button.
Foundries are extremely capital-intensive facilities that come with all sorts of massive barriers to entry. They need lots of space and can be highly environmentally disruptive, both in construction as well as in operation. And permits from governments, from national to local entities, can be very, very difficult to get.
I remember many years ago in Shanghai, I was invited to an initial presentation by a coop led by Siemens (OTCMKTS:SIEGY) about a new fabrication plant that was getting built in south-central China. The project was supposed to get done in under a year — which seemed impossible anywhere beyond China.
They took a small mountain and leveled it, making a clear building site with access to transportation of raw materials and finished chips. And then they built and finished it all ahead of schedule and the plant is still humming along today.
This, of course, would never happen in the U.S. But that’s yet another great thing about China when it comes to business.


					7 Dividend Stocks To Buy For Adventurous Investors 				

And China remains the go-to nation for foundries, along with some regional locations. And despite all of the bluster over competition – China and its regional partners are the go-to places for getting chips made from start to finish.
Here are some of the companies that I would have you take a look at if you are interested in investing in what’s behind the brands of electronics that make it all happen.
Samsung Electronics
Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (OTCMKTS:SMICY)
United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE:UMC)

Samsung Electronics
Samsung Electronics is a Korea-based behemoth that has a great relationship with China and the region when it comes to manufacturing just about everything electronic. It is one of the globe’s leaders in foundries for chips. That in turn feeds its own needs for its own high-value-added products as well as supplying others.
This company should be in any portfolio that wants to be exposed to the best of technology, including foundries.
Source: Samsung Electronics Revenue – Source: Bloomberg

	
Revenue for the company continues to expand year after year with the past decade showing gains averaging 7.51% on a compound annual growth rate basis (CAGR). Of course, foundries are just one business — along with batteries (including processing all sorts of very nasty chemicals to make them happen) as well as countless finished industrial and consumer products.
But with nearly everything from soup to nuts in its operations, its operating margin is very impressive at 12.1%, demonstrating its cost controls and excellent management. This, in turn, drives an impressive return on shareholder’s equity of 7.5%.
Dividends are getting better, running at a yield of 2.4%. And with lots and lots of cash and pretty much no real debt, the company is the best to start with in the chip business.
Source: Samsung Electronics Total Return – Source: Bloomberg

	
The shares in U.S. dollars have been a consistent performer with the past decade alone generating a return of 354.81% for an average annual equivalent return of 16.34%. One thing to note — you may have to call your broker for execution, and this may or may not incur a fee.

Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM, 2330 Taipei) is a Chinese behemoth in the chips business headquartered in Hsinchu on the island of Formosa. Like for Samsung, Taiwan Semi provides a litany of chips and related products that generally are done under contract with a who’s-who in the electronics markets.
It has massive foundries throughout China and its territories and works well with governments in its plant and foundry developments. And it in turn generally controls one of the largest percentages of chips made in any given year for customers around the globe.
Revenue from its more focused product line on chips and components continues to rise. Over the past decades, the company has achieved revenue gains running at 12.56% on a CAGR basis.
Source: Taiwan Semiconductor Revenue – Source: Bloomberg

	
Its margin is much better than for the much more diverse Samsung, and is running currently at 34.8%.

And in turn, this drives a return on shareholder equity at a whopping 29.1%.
Source: Taiwan Semiconductor Total Return – Source: Bloomberg

	
The shares have returned 989.02% over the trailing decade for an annual equivalent return of 26.95% including a dividend yield of 2.2%. And with lots of cash and little debt, the company is set to continue to expand as needed.

Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMICY)
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMICY, 981 Hong Kong) is also known as SMIC. It, too, has some of the leading foundries in China and does a great job of running them from its headquarters in Shanghai.
Like for Taiwan Semi, SMIC does a lot of contract work — which makes for a broad play on chips and the overall demand for electronic goods.
Source: SMIC Revenue – Source: Bloomberg

	
Revenue has a long-term history of steady growth, with the average running at 10.43% on a CAGR basis.
The company has a bit less cash on hand and a bit more debt — which can be more common for larger-scale Chinese companies. But at only 24.00% of assets, it is not an issue — nor should it limit growth, as it is well-supported by the government.
Source: SMIC Total Return – Source: Bloomberg

	
The stock has been plodding along for many years until the last two — but since then, it has returned 190.14%, for a quick average annual equivalent of 70.21%. It is also a cheaper stock like Samsung as its stock is valued at a low 2.07 times its intrinsic value (book).
No dividend yield, but it does make for a value buy in the foundry space.

United Microelectronics (UMC)
United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC, 2303 Taipei) is more commonly known as UMC. And the company makes a variety of semiconductor chips and integrated circuit chips for a litany of companies, from consumer to industrials.
It has major Chinese foundries and assembly facilities, and since its founding back in 1980, it has continued to earn contracts year in and year out from customers around the world.
Source: UMC Revenue – Source: Bloomberg

	
Revenue has been gaining at a bit more of a steady, if not subdued  level compared to its foundry peers. Gains average only at 2.71% on a CAGR basis.
And margins are tighter than for its cross-town rival Taiwan Semi at a more subdued level of 3.2%. But with more cash and controlled debt, the company is still a go-to maker with ample government support.
Source: UMC Total Return – Source: Bloomberg

	
Shares have had a history of muted return until the past two years – but still have garnered some 250.39% for shareholders over the past five years.

And with a dividend yielding 2.50% and shares even cheaper at 1.83 times intrinsic value – closer to the absolute bargain of Samsung it does make for a value in the foundry market.

(See TSM stock analysis on TipRanks).TSM CFO Wendell Huang said, “Moving into fourth quarter 2020, we expect our sequential growth to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer technology, driven by 5G smartphone launches and HPC-related applications.”Ahead of its earnings release, on October 12, Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini reiterated his Sell rating on the stock with a price target of $55 (37.9% downside potential). Hosseini is concerned about excessive inventory build out in the smartphone category business. Nonetheless, the analyst believes that “the excess smartphone inventory bubble won't burst until after 2021 CNY (Chinese New Year) holidays.”Currently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 4 Buys versus 1 Sell. With shares up over 52% year-to-date, the average price target of $55 implies downside potential of 37.9% at current levels.Related News:  Twilio Stock Gains 7.7% On $3.2B Segment Deal; Street Stays Bullish   Palo Alto or CrowdStrike: Which Cybersecurity Stock Is A Safer Bet?

2020-10-15	2020-10-15 08:40:26	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	IPhone Chipmaker TSMC Lifts 2020 Outlook Expecting Big 5G Boost	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. raised its 2020 revenue forecast for a second time this year, reflecting strong demand for 5G mobile devices like Apple Inc.’s new iPhones and high-performance computing in the post-pandemic era.The world’s largest contract chipmaker now expects 2020 sales to climb more than 30% in dollar terms, compared with a previous forecast of growth of more than 20%. For the current quarter, revenue should be between $12.4 billion and $12.7 billion, while gross margin will be between 51.5% and 53.5%, Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang told analysts.The main chipmaker for Apple’s iPhones continues to invest in expanding and upgrading technology, anticipating strong demand from 5G smartphones as well as for server chips as countries gradually emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic. Executives said Thursday they expect capital spending of about $17 billion in 2020, the high end of its previously forecast range.Previously disclosed monthly numbers showed sales climbed to a record NT$356.4 billion ($12.4 billion) in the three months to September, boosting profit by a higher-than-expected 36%. TSMC’s business typically kicks into high gear in the months before Apple unveils its new phones and the holiday season. It also received a boost during the quarter as second-largest customer Huawei Technologies Co. raced to stockpile supplies before a U.S. ban on shipments to the Chinese telecom giant came into effect last month.“Covid-19 is accelerating digital transformation, while 5G and HPC applications continue to drive” demand, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said at a briefing. “Strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technology” will drive growth through the fourth quarter, he added.Third-quarter net income rose to an all-time high of NT$137.3 billion, versus the average analyst estimate of NT$126 billion. Gross margin improved slightly to 53.4%, topping the company’s own guidance.The most-advanced 5-nanometer process technology -- used to make Apple’s A14 chips -- accounted for about 8% of total revenue during the quarter, while 7nm and 16nm made up 35% and 18%, respectively. By business segment, TSMC’s smartphone business expanded 12%, while HPC posted the strongest growth, jumping 25%.Overall inventory for customers, including smartphone makers, will remain above seasonal levels for some time due to lingering concerns over the reliability of supply chains, TSMC said. Still, executives sought to allay concerns over inventory levels, citing expectations that more manufacturers will roll out new 5G devices and an acceleration in technology adoption amid shelter-in-place measures.The company reiterated that it was complying with U.S. government restrictions on Huawei and had stopped shipments to the telecom giant after mid-September. Wei declined to comment on “unfounded speculation” that TSMC may have received licenses to supply the Chinese company.On Tuesday, Apple unveiled its latest iPhone lineup, saying two new models will come out on Oct. 23 while two other models will arrive three weeks later. The Cupertino, California-based company expects to build at least 75 million new 5G iPhones this year, roughly in line with its previous flagship launch, Bloomberg News has reported.TSMC shares have surged roughly 83% from their March lows amid signs that the company is bouncing back from the worst of the coronavirus-induced disruptions.”Market players have anticipated 5G being a major growth driver,” GF Securities analyst Jeff Pu said. TSMC’s fourth-quarter guidance is about in line with the average analyst estimates, while a bit lower than buy-side expectations, he added.Read more: TSMC’s Dominance Highlighted in One Single Number: Tim Culpan(Updates with CEO’s comments in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-record-profit-beats-forecasts-053257854.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-10-15	2020-10-15 07:36:07	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC's Dominance Highlighted in One Single Number	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The story of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s industry dominance steamed ahead unabated Thursday, with record earnings on the back of booming demand for chips used in smartphones and servers. Yet one figure highlights just how much power the company now has as rivals fall by the wayside.Net income climbed 36% to $4.8 billion, higher than even the most bullish of estimates, while the made-to-order chipmaker raised its full-year revenue outlook to growth of more than 30%, in U.S. dollar terms. There’s another figure worth examining. Average price per wafer isn’t a closely followed metric in the foundry industry; indeed, most investors don’t even bother to calculate it. Instead, the focus is usually on more obvious numbers like gross margin — an indicator of how much profit can be squeezed out after subtracting costs, which includes depreciation on assets. In the third quarter, TSMC charged a record $3,747 per 12-inch equivalent wafer. That’s 9% more than in the same quarter of 2019, and 23% higher than three years ago. Rising prices aren’t a given in the foundry industry: In the five years to 2018, TSMC raised prices only an average 1.6% annually. It must balance numerous factors, including costs, capacity and demand before deciding how much to charge. But things started changing last year, coinciding with some important shifts in both the industry and the global political economy. Once neck-and-neck with Samsung Electronics Co., TSMC has now pulled ahead at the leading edge, while Intel Corp., formerly the world’s most-advanced chipmaker, has fallen further behind. The Hsinchu-based company now commands around 54% of the chip foundry market, according to researcher TrendForce.At the same time, the rollout of 5G mobile technology and artificial intelligence ran smack into the tech Cold War (which includes the U.S. effectively banning TSMC from selling to China’s champion, Huawei Technologies Co.). This meant that the queue of companies wanting the best chip manufacturing in the world — such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Huawei — kept growing, while the supply of foundries able to meet their needs faces continued congestion.This seems to have emboldened management to keep raising prices. Clients appear undeterred. Chips are generally the most important item in a device — be it a flashy new iPhone or high-end server — and the higher cost is far outweighed by the greater power and efficiency that superior components provide. I’ve warned before that TSMC ought to be careful. Regulators, clients and governments may worry that the company is becoming too powerful. Signs that it’s leveraging its power to raise prices could add those to concerns.Right now, though, everybody still needs TSMC. That’s a nice position to be in, while it lasts.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-09-28	2020-09-28 08:19:46	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	China’s Largest Chipmaker Sinks After U.S. Restrictions	(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. retreated to a four-month low in Hong Kong after the U.S. imposed export restrictions on China’s largest chipmaker.The shares declined 3.9% on Monday, adding to their 25% loss for the month. Also listed in Shanghai, SMIC’s stock there slumped 7% to the lowest level since its July debut. U.S. firms must now apply for a license to export certain products to the chipmaker, the Commerce Dept. said in a letter dated Sept. 25, reviewed by Bloomberg News. SMIC and its subsidiaries present “an unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end use,” the department’s Bureau of Industry and Security wrote.Read more: U.S. Imposes Restrictions on Exports to China’s Top ChipmakerThe U.S. stopped short of placing SMIC on the so-called entity list, which means the restrictions are not yet as severe as those imposed on China’s Huawei Technologies Co. Still, the ruling against the chipmaker marks a further escalation in the tensions between the world’s two most powerful countries that have already ensnared other Chinese tech companies including ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.“The restriction, once implemented, will severely damage SMIC’s existing and future manufacturing capabilities, and customer trust,” Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a note. “Without steady supply and service from the U.S., the yield and quality of SMIC’s capacity will degrade, as early as in a few months for more advanced nodes.”SMIC has not received an official notice of the sanctions, has no relationship with the Chinese armed forces and does not manufacture goods for any military end-users or uses, the Shanghai-based company said in an emailed statement over the weekend. Commenting on the actions against SMIC, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a briefing Monday that Beijing will “continue to take necessary measures to safeguard Chinese businesses’ legitimate rights and interest.”The SMIC ruling was a compromise between the Departments of Defense and Commerce and moderates in the Trump administration, according to one person familiar with the negotiations. The U.S. has reportedly said it was mulling a more severe blacklisting on SMIC -- akin to the ones imposed on Huawei -- that would affect exports from a broader set of companies.“If SMIC is not included in the Entity List, this could merely be confirmation of the rule change announced on April 27 for ‘civilian end-users’ in U.S.-unfriendly countries,” Jefferies analyst Edison Lee wrote in a note. “Instead of a blanket ban, the U.S. will have sole discretion on what U.S. companies can sell to SMIC.” The brokerage had previously estimated that as much as 50% of SMIC’s equipment is from the U.S.A formal statement that includes details of the restriction may be released by the U.S. Commerce Department Monday, Citigroup said. There will be a comment period of 30 days before the ruling takes effect, with semiconductor equipment companies and industry groups expected to push back against the restrictions, analysts including Atif Malik wrote in a note.The news lifted shares of SMIC’s rivals, with United Microelectronics Corp. surging by the 10% daily limit in Taipei. Taiwanese chipmakers Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp. and Macronix International Co. rallied more than 9%, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. climbed 1.8%.Even though SMIC shares have more than halved from the record high set in July, some investors are recommending caution because the U.S. measures may derail its efforts to catch up to TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker. SMIC is still up 50% for the year, outpacing the 30% gain in TSMC, but the Shanghai-based firm’s revenue and profit amount to roughly 10% and 3%, respectively, of its Taiwanese rival. For the current quarter, industry researcher TrendForce estimates that TSMC controls 54% of the foundry market, versus SMIC’s 4.5% market share.“SMIC’s valuations have reached relatively reasonable levels following the recent decline, but the long-term outlook is unclear. If the U.S. imposes restrictions against the company, especially on some key equipment that can only be supplied there, there will be a very big impact on the company,” said Qi He, a fund manager at Huatai-Pinebridge Fund Management Co. “We will mainly adopt a wait-and-see approach, until there is a resolution to the U.S. situation.”(Updates share prices throughout)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-largest-chipmaker-sinks-u-020300297.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-09-28	2020-09-28 00:50:37	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	SMIC Joins the Big Bath of China Security Threats	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Having delivered a heavy blow to the semiconductor plans of China’s biggest technology manufacturer, the U.S. government now seems keen to knock down the nation’s biggest contract chipmaker. The action looks opportunistic.Export restrictions placed on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. mean U.S. companies will have to apply for a license to sell some products to the Shanghai-based chipmaker.The rules don’t appear as strict as those placed on Huawei Technologies Co. earlier this year, according to Bloomberg News. That move ended up forcing suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to stop making chips to the Chinese company’s design.Yet the timing should raise eyebrows. The U.S. Commerce Department is implementing the ban because products sold to the chipmaker pose an “unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end use,” according to a letter from the department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the report said.That sounds terrifying. In reality, anything sold to any company could end up having a military use: from an operating system developed by a software maker (armies use computers), to rubber and chemicals made by industrial giants (military trucks have tires).Despite the increased rhetoric from the Trump administration, the U.S. doesn’t apply arbitrary rules to its definition of military end use. In fact, the bureau has a set of guidelines on the topic. In April, it broadened its definition while adding China to a small cohort of nations — Russia and Venezuela being the others — for which a specific set of Export Administration Regulations apply. It outlined the likely result:This expansion will require increased diligence with respect to the evaluation of end users in China, particularly in view of China's widespread civil-military integration.A month later, the department added 24 groups to its entities list because of a risk that they would support “procurement of items for military end-use in China.” SMIC wasn’t among them. It’s possible that something happened over the past four months to make the Commerce Department suddenly worried about the threat from SMIC. Maybe that extra $7 billion it raised in a Shanghai listing two months ago raised red flags, or it could be that the chip foundry was simply next in line to be dealt with after Huawei.To be sure, there’s no doubt that China poses a threat to U.S. national security. A large nation with a growing economy, rising defense budget and territorial ambitions is by definition a risk.Yet the increased frequency of alarm bells ringing and the weird choice of targets — the forced sale of TikTok and the pointless ban on WeChat come to mind —  suggest a different narrative.With less than two months to the U.S. election, and four months remaining in this presidential term, there’s a sense that hawks in the administration may have decided this is the best time to push through a tough-on-China stance.In finance, the concept of a big bath posits that companies dump bad news into one reporting period to get it done with, and to make later periods look relatively strong. With President Donald Trump keen to blame China for so many of America’s woes, and there being no guarantee that a Joe Biden presidency would be as aggressive toward Beijing, leadership in the Commerce, State and Defense departments may be seizing the moment.Once implemented, tighter rules, company bans, and forced divestitures will be difficult for any president to roll back without appearing soft. Trump is unlikely to object, having kicked off this “tough on China” streak during his first presidential campaign, while the Biden camp will see no political advantage in pushing back against such escalation ahead of the Nov. 3 ballot.As we count down the days, expect this big bath of announced Chinese security threats to get even bigger. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Failure to do that threatens U.S. leadership of the sector as a whole, it added.The lobbying group, which represents companies such as Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., is making the pitch at a time when it believes Washington is more open to listening. The China-U.S. trade war and supply-chain disruptions caused by the pandemic have revealed the risks of having such vital components made abroad.“Six months ago, I don’t think we could have had this discussion, the world’s gone in our direction,” said John Neuffer, chief executive officer of the SIA. “It’s not a bit of a change in Washington, it’s a significant shift.”The $400 billion semiconductor industry is led by U.S. companies, but many chipmakers, such as Nvidia Corp. and Qualcomm, outsource production to factories mostly in Asia. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. dominates that part of the market and also makes chips designed by Apple Inc. and other U.S. tech giants.Production techniques, including chemical processes, and complex manufacturing equipment play a vital role in determining chip performance. The U.S. needs to keep a chunk of this work domestic so it can maintain its knowledge base and ownership of the skills, the SIA said.While U.S. production ebbs, China’s government is pouring money into its domestic semiconductor industry, conferring the same kind of priority on the effort it accorded to building its atomic capability. That has made chip manufacturing a matter of national security.Read more: China Said to Plan Broad Chip Sector Support to Fight TrumpThe SIA said new U.S. plants built with federal support “would bring state-of-the-art manufacturing technology and sufficient capacity to cover semiconductor demand from the U.S. defense and aerospace industries.”Only 6% of the new global capacity in development will be located in the U.S. In contrast, China will add about 40% of the new capacity over the next decade and become the largest semiconductor manufacturing location in the world, the SIA noted in its report.Senator John Cornyn is sponsoring a bipartisan CHIPS for America Act to increase government support for the industry, and he weighed in on the issue on Wednesday.“Domestic semiconductor manufacturing has been steadily declining, and the COVID-19 pandemic has made clear how vulnerable our existing supply chains are,” the Republican senator from Texas said. “This report underscores the need to boost American production of semiconductors.”Locating a plant in the U.S. costs about 30% more over a decade than comparable sites in Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. China may be as much as 50% cheaper, according to the report.It takes as much as $20 billion to build a big chip plant, considerably more than a new aircraft carrier or nuclear power plant, the report estimated. Over a decade, semiconductor factories cost as much as $40 billion. Government incentives around the world reduce that bill by up to $13 billion, according to the report.Most incentives in the U.S. are provided by state governments that can’t compete against countries with bigger budgets, the SIA said. Some countries offer grants to make the required land free. Others slash corporate and property taxes or help with the cost of equipment purchases. The U.S. ranks way down the list in most of those categories, many controlled by Washington, the group added.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chip-industry-wants-50-billion-120000236.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-10	2020-09-10 10:22:10	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Huawei Revs Up Android Substitute as U.S. Curbs Hit Phone Sales	(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. introduced a more polished and expansive iteration of its HarmonyOS, the operating system it’s developing to replace Android and help China’s largest technology company navigate increasingly strict U.S. sanctions. It also announced plans to offer the software for other phone makers to put on their devices.Speaking at the Huawei Developer Conference in Dongguan, consumer group chief Richard Yu said that Huawei will have beta versions of HarmonyOS 2.0 available for smart TVs, watches and car infotainment systems from today, to be followed by smartphones in December.Huawei’s pitch to developers revolved around the open, secure and distributed nature of the latest OS, making it easy to deploy across devices and screen sizes. The first handsets to support it can be expected next year, Yu added. In a world increasingly split along U.S.-China trade lines, Huawei presented HarmonyOS as a potential go-to operating system for its home market.The world’s biggest smartphone maker admitted that U.S. curbs on its chip supply have impacted smartphone shipments, which were 105 million units in the first half of 2020 after reaching 240 million in 2019, according to company data. Still, Yu focused on expanding the Huawei Mobile Services ecosystem, which now counts 1.8 million developers and 490 million active users. It now supports roughly 96,000 apps and is the third-largest mobile ecosystem after Apple Inc.’s iOS and Google’s Android, according to Yu.Read more: Deepening Huawei Curbs Send Asian Chipmakers PlungingThe embattled Chinese company has been fighting for its survival after the Trump administration imposed a series of sanctions that cut Huawei off from its clients and suppliers. Huawei had to use its stockpiles of components to make products from base stations to smartphones. After Sept. 15, it will lose almost all access to partners like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has been making Huawei’s Kirin processors. Kirin chips have in the past competed strongly against Qualcomm Inc.’s Snapdragon silicon and Huawei has invested heavily in developing its 5G wireless solutions.Without the ability to produce or source components for its own smartphones, the company’s mobile business looks in jeopardy, though that isn’t preventing it from actively developing and expanding HarmonyOS as a long-term alternative to the dominant duo of American mobile platforms.(Updates with number of apps in the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-widens-access-harmonyos-bid-092851207.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-09	2020-09-09 01:08:33	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Blockchain Players Beat Gold and Bitcoin in the Pandemic	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Gold and its digital counterpart, Bitcoin, have had a pretty good run among investors seeking a haven or those willing to take a punt on cryptocurrency.But they’ve been pipped in the past year by another investment thesis that’s perhaps a little more tangible, highlighting the old adage that it’s smartest to be selling shovels in a gold rush.Instead of buying into either asset, those who threw their money behind a basket of companies with exposure to blockchain technologies would have returned 54% over the past year, even after the recent rout that’s hit global tech stocks the hardest.(1) Gold is up just 27% over that time, despite a boom since March, while Bitcoin is actually down 1.8%. Elwood Asset Management LLP’s Blockchain Global Equity Index — ticker: BLOCK — is a collection of 45 companies involved in the blockchain ecosystem, a technology that deploys cryptography to store information in distributed ledgers and is resistant to modification or manipulation. Its top-three holdings are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Kakao Corp. and Monex Group Inc. TSMC is well known as the chief supplier of chips that go into cryptocurrency miners, the high-powered computers that solve mathematical calculations at the heart of Bitcoin and similar digital currencies. Seoul-based Kakao was best known for its chat app of the same name before it started getting into the blockchain business two years ago. Japan’s Monex was once the nation’s largest online brokerage, subsequently losing ground to SBI Holdings Inc. and Rakuten Inc., and bought cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck in 2018.Collectively, the Top 10 performers in the index have each returned more than 54% over the past year, with “online retailer and advocate of blockchain technology” Overstock.com Inc. climbing ninefold (even after a plunge of 45% since Aug. 20) after second-quarter revenue more than doubled. Kakao is the third-best, up 147%.To be fair, the solid returns among most of the index’s members may be only obliquely connected to their exposure to the blockchain ecosystem. TSMC, for example, has largely benefited from the U.S.-China tech rivalry and increased demand for personal computers, servers and games consoles amid prolonged pandemic-driven social distancing.Investors may not care exactly why these players did so well, but the mere fact that they delivered such solid returns will likely be reason enough for the true believers to advocate embracing the blockchain revolution.(1) Returns calculated prior to New York market open Sept. 8,2020.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-09-08	2020-09-08 21:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Japanese Chip Gear Supplier Eyes Rebound in Flash Memory Orders	(Bloomberg) -- Screen Holdings Co., a Japanese maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, is seeing signs of a rebound in demand from flash memory makers, while DRAM manufacturers hold back spending.A slump in overall orders for chip gear in the three months ended June 30 will be short-lived, followed by a rebound over the next two quarters and a dip in the final one, Screen President Toshio Hiroe said in an interview. The company expects full-year orders and sales in the business to be little changed from the last fiscal period, with demand from Taiwanese foundries helping to offset sluggish spending by DRAM makers.“The conditions in the Nand market are looking good and chipmakers are beginning to invest in preparation for future demand,” Hiroe said. “DRAM recovery has been slow going.”Chipmakers and their suppliers have faced an uneven recovery as the coronavirus pandemic spurred demand for home computing equipment even as the global economic downturn hurt spending elsewhere. Screen, whose customers include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp., reported a 28% drop in orders for semiconductor production equipment during the June quarter.Screen, the world’s biggest maker of silicon wafer cleaning equipment, is looking to grow revenue in the business by as much as 30% over the next four years. The company, which already controls about 80% of the market for the most advanced cleaners, is developing new machines to expand its share of less cutting-edge chip processes, Hiroe said, declining to give further detail. Its competitors in this business include chip gear giant Tokyo Electron Ltd., Lam Research Corp. and Chinese manufacturers.“Getting to those mid-term targets will depend on them achieving market shares gains,” said Damian Thong, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. “The equipment market is competitive, so this will be no mean feat.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japanese-chip-gear-supplier-eyes-210000380.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-03	2020-09-03 09:04:58	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	China to Plan Sweeping Support for Chip Sector to Counter Trump	(Bloomberg) -- China is planning a sweeping set of new government policies to develop its domestic semiconductor industry and counter Trump administration restrictions, conferring the same kind of priority on the effort it accorded to building its atomic capability, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Beijing is preparing broad support for so-called third-generation semiconductors for the five years through 2025, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing government deliberations. A suite of measures to bolster research, education and financing for the industry has been added to a draft of the country’s 14th five-year plan, which will be presented to the country’s top leaders in October, the people said.China’s top leaders will gather next month to lay out their economic strategy for the next half decade, including efforts to ramp up domestic consumption and make critical technology at home. President Xi Jinping has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies ranging from wireless networks to artificial intelligence. Semiconductors are fundamental to virtually every component of China’s technology ambitions -- and an increasingly aggressive Trump administration threatens to cut off their supply from abroad.“The Chinese leadership realizes that semiconductors underpin all advanced technologies, and that it can no longer dependably rely on American supplies,” said Dan Wang, technology analyst at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. “In the face of stricter U.S. restrictions on chip access, China’s response can only be to keep pushing its own industry to develop.”Shares in several major Chinese chipmakers gained. Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Group Co. finished 4.3% higher in Hong Kong. On mainland bourses, Will Semiconductor Ltd. -- the second most valuable listed Chinese chip firm -- rose almost 10%. Xiamen Changelight Co. closed 14% up while Focus Lightings Tech Co. jumped 5.6%.The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which is responsible for drafting the tech-related goals, did not reply to a request for comment.China Still Buying $300 Billion of Chips From U.S., ElsewhereChina imports more than $300 billion worth of integrated circuits each year and its semiconductor developers rely on U.S.-made chip design tools and patents, as well as critical manufacturing technologies from U.S. allies. But deteriorating ties between Beijing and Washington have made it increasingly difficult for Chinese companies to source components and chipmaking technologies from overseas.The U.S. government has blacklisted dozens of China’s tech companies so they can’t buy American parts, and slapped bans on ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat. In the case of technology giant Huawei Technologies Co., the Trump administration sanctioned the company and pressed allies to ban the company’s equipment from their telecom networks.This month, Huawei, the country’s largest handset maker, will even lose access to chips from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. under new American regulations that prohibit suppliers anywhere in the world from working with the company if those suppliers use American equipment. The tighter rules have raised the urgency of building domestic alternatives in Beijing.Third-generation semiconductors are mainly chipsets made of materials such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride. They can operate at high frequency and in higher power and temperature environments, and are widely used in fifth-generation radio frequency chips, military-grade radars and electric vehicles.Read more: China’s Chip Executives Worry They’re Next on U.S. Hit ListSince no single country now dominates the fledgling, third-generation technology, China’s gamble is its corporations can compete if they accelerate research into the field now. Global leaders such as U.S.-based CREE Inc. and Japan’s Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. are just beginning to grow this business, while Chinese tech giants such as Sanan Optoelectronics Co. Ltd. and state-owned China Electronics Technology Group Corp. have made inroads on third-generation chipsets.The country’s other chipmakers, which include Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., Will Semiconductor Ltd. and National Silicon Industry Group Co., may benefit more broadly from the state support.“This is a sector about to see explosive growth,” Alan Zhou, managing partner of Fujian-based chip investment fund An Xin Capital Co., told an industry forum last week. Because of China’s increasing demand and investment, this is an area that could create a “world-class Chinese chip giant.”(Updates with closing share action in the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-plan-sweeping-support-chip-060908646.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-02	2020-09-02 21:30:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	U.S. Tech Bans, Pandemic No Match for Asia’s Electronics Rebound	(Bloomberg) -- The electronics sector has found a way to thrive amid the global pandemic, with 5G demand helping the industry remain a rare catalyst for Asian factories.South Korean computer sales surged 107% in August and semiconductor shipments grew for a third month in the past four, even as smartphone sales declined and overall exports fell 9.9% from a year earlier, figures out Tuesday showed.Taiwan’s manufacturing output rose 2.6% in July, while production of computers and integrated circuits climbed by double digits. Shipments of electronics products from Singapore rose in July for a third straight month.The latest data bolster forecasts that this year’s electronics rebound will persist, even as a U.S. ban on Huawei Technologies Co., further U.S.-China trade tensions and an eventual tapering of demand for work-from-home equipment present obstacles for the industry.Relentless demand for 5G-related applications, including infrastructure and smartphones, is poised to keep electronics production humming as other output struggles to recover from the pandemic. Even the latest technology bans on Huawei look to be just a stumbling block.“It’s kind of a little bit of a bump,” Rajan Rajgopal, chief executive officer of Singapore-based DenseLight Semiconductors Pte., said in an Aug. 28 interview.Two areas of business especially have been booming since before the pandemic: data centers and 5G infrastructure, said Rajgopal, who’s worked in semiconductors for about 25 years. China accounts for about half of DenseLight’s customer base and could take an increasing share as it builds out its next-generation wireless infrastructure across the country -- boosting demand for semiconductors that go into devices as diverse as street cameras and oil-pipeline sensors.Global semiconductor industry revenue is set to slip by only 0.9% this year to $415.4 billion amid pandemic-related disruptions, according to Gartner Inc. estimates.Still, significant risk factors are keeping electronics watchers on guard. U.S. President Donald Trump’s potential re-election in November could mean more headaches for Asian supply chains, while it’s unclear how his rival for the White House, former Vice President Joe Biden, would alter U.S. strategy toward China. And retailers across sectors are bracing for a holiday season that could disappoint if government stimulus wears off and labor markets worsen.For now, though, companies expect the electronics boom to overcome the risks -- with Taiwanese firms seeing themselves particularly well-placed to ride out the storm. Industry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is charting a “PC resurgence” amid Covid-19, C.C. Tsai, senior director of the company’s Asia-Pacific business, said in a video for a company symposium Aug. 25.Despite concerns that increased work-from-home orders for things like laptops and webcams would prove temporary, computer demand “continues to remain robust,” and many consumers spending more time at home are also upgrading their television sets, Chairman Fang Leuh of Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp., a TSMC affiliate that specializes in power management chips and display driver chips, told reporters Aug. 29.That matches the read of Quanta Computer Inc., which makes Apple Inc. MacBooks, HP Inc. notebooks and servers for Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Google. Elton Yang, chief financial officer of Taiwan-based Quanta, says notebook shipments are expected to grow by double digits in the third quarter.“Strong orders from our customers confirm shelter-in-place demand is long-term,” Quanta Chairman Barry Lam told reporters Aug. 13. “We will create more products for the shelter-in-place economy to optimize our profitability. This is a big change. We will grab it and gain better opportunities.”Industry executives acknowledge greater uncertainties around the trade war, U.S. elections and Covid-19, while taking a longer view on the prospects for electronics.Apple, for example, has asked suppliers to build at least 75 million 5G iPhones for later this year -- roughly in line with last year’s launch -- a sign that demand for the company’s most important product is holding up despite the pandemic and recession.Vanguard’s Fang emphasized very strong demand into 2021 for the type of semiconductors his company makes, aided by rollout of 5G technologies. And even if Trump wins another four-year term, complicating DenseLight’s China business, Rajgopal sees a brighter outlook.“The electronics industry is a lot more resilient than eight years,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-tech-bans-pandemic-no-213000285.html?.tsrc=rss

Nvidia has long worked with a variety of chip manufacturers to fabricate its devices, and more recently has relied on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd for its most advanced chips.  Samsung will make the new GeForce chips with its 8-nanometer chipmaking process rather than its latest 5nm process.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-taps-samsung-micron-gaming-164500523.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-09-01	2020-09-01 16:45:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Nvidia Unveils New Graphics Chips to Fend Off AMD, Consoles	(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. said its new graphics chips will double the performance of their predecessors, offering gamers more realistic images at the speed they demand.The new Ampere range is the second by Nvidia that uses ray-tracing technology to simulate how light interacts with virtual objects in video games and other computer graphics.The new top-of-the-line GeForce RTX 3090 will go on sale for $1,499 and head a list of graphics cards that start at $499, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in a video briefing from his kitchen at home in Silicon Valley. Wearing his signature leather jacket, the executive unveiled the product by taking it out of an oven.Ray tracing has taken a while to catch on in the video game industry, but Nvidia said hundreds of games use the approach, or will take advantage of it soon. While the technology makes images more lifelike, it requires a lot more computing power, Huang said. That has slowed the frame rate, or how fast images are updated in video games. The new Ampere design will address this, the CEO added.Nvidia is trying to stay ahead of renewed challenges from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp., while keeping PC-gaming competitive with new consoles from Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. later this year.In its most recent quarter Nvidia had games-related sales of $1.65 billion, up 26% from a year earlier. It’s predicting a similar expansion this quarter. PC gaming has become a widespread pastime and billion-dollar sport, creating a market with millions of consumers who will pay more for one Nvidia component than most people will spend for a whole computer.As the largest maker of graphics chips, Nvidia has ridden this wave of growth, while expanding into other markets such as data center processors. That’s fueled a surge in its stock. Nvidia shares ended 2010 at just over $15 and closed at $534.98 in New York on Monday.The top-end Ampere product will have 28 billion transistors and the chips will be manufactured by Samsung Electronics Co. using its 8-nanometer process. Nvidia remains a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. customer for its outsourced production as well, executives said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-unveils-graphics-chips-fend-164500247.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-09-01	2020-09-01 14:10:01	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Preparing 75 Million 5G iPhones Alongside New Watches and iPad	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has asked suppliers to build at least 75 million 5G iPhones for later this year, roughly in line with last year’s launch, in a sign that demand for the company’s most important product is holding up in the midst of the global pandemic and recession.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant anticipates shipments of these next-generation iPhones may reach as high as 80 million units in 2020, according to people familiar with the situation. Apple plans to launch four new models in October with fifth-generation wireless speeds, a different design and a wider choice of screen sizes, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unannounced products.Among a comprehensive product refresh in the fall, Apple is also preparing a new iPad Air with an edge-to-edge iPad Pro-like screen, two new Apple Watch versions and its first over-ear headphones outside the Beats brand. A smaller HomePod speaker is in the works, too. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Suppliers to the Silicon Valley giant rose on Tuesday. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and LG Display Co. closed 2% up, lens supplier Largan Precision Co. climbed 4.1% and headphones assembler Goertek Inc. gained 2.1%. Apple rose 2% at 10:07 a.m. in New York.Apple and its manufacturing partners always ramp up production ahead of the rollout of new iPhones each fall. In the summer of 2019, suppliers were preparing to make components for as many as 75 million handsets. The target in 2018 was similar, so this year’s goal of 75 million to 80 million units is a bullish sign. Key iPhone assembly partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., also known as Foxconn, has put up several notices on WeChat over the past month recruiting workers for its main iPhone campus in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou.While the Covid-19 outbreak has hammered the global economy and disrupted supply chains, Apple is seeing strong demand for iPhones, iPads and Mac computers from people working and studying remotely. Revenue from iPhones crushed Wall Street expectations in the most recent quarter. The device still generates almost half of Apple’s sales, and that often tops 60% in the holiday season. Apple shares have soared 76% this year, making it the first U.S. company to surpass $2 trillion in market value.The four new phones will be split into two basic and two high-end models for the first time, and all will feature OLED displays with improved color and clarity. The two regular iPhones will come in a new 5.4-inch size and a 6.1-inch option, while the Pro devices will offer a choice of a 6.1-inch or an enlarged 6.7-inch display, which will be the largest Apple’s ever put in an iPhone.All of the new smartphones will have updated designs with squared edges similar to the iPad Pro, and the high-end phones will continue to use stainless steel edges versus aluminum sides on the cheaper variants. The company is also planning a dark blue color option on the Pro models to replace the Midnight Green of 2019’s iPhone 11 Pro line.Read more: Apple Plans iPad-Like Design for Next iPhone, Smaller HomePodAt least the larger of the Pro phones will have the same LIDAR camera as on the latest iPad Pro, which allows augmented-reality apps to have a greater understanding of their surrounding environment. Among the most significant improvements of the new handsets will be the new A14 processor, upgrading speed and power efficiency.Some Apple employees testing the new devices think that the new 6.7-inch screen is one of this year’s most notable improvements, the people familiar with the situation said. A few testers have also found that some of the current 5G networks are not improving connection speeds much, the people added.Apple plans to ship the lower-end phones sooner than the Pro devices, according to people familiar with the staggered release strategy. During a recent conference call, Apple said the new iPhones would ship a “few weeks” later than last year’s models, which started shipping Sept. 20. This year’s rollout is on course to be the latest since the release of the iPhone X in November 2017.The design of this year’s iPhones and many features were finished before Covid-19 spread, but the pandemic did create issues for final testing and delayed the start of production by several weeks. While the new iPhones won’t ship until later, Apple’s iOS 14 software will arrive in September, the people said.Read more: Apple Culture of Secrecy Tested by Employees Working RemotelyThe new Apple Watch lineup will include a successor to the Apple Watch Series 5 and a replacement for the Series 3 that will compete with lower-cost fitness devices such as those from Fitbit Inc.The smaller HomePod will help Apple renew its push into the smart home at a lower price, albeit with fewer speakers inside the device than the current $299 model. While the first HomePod was praised for its audio quality, consumers have panned its limited Siri functionality and price. Earlier this year, Apple merged some of the Apple TV and HomePod engineering teams as it looks to renew its focus on home devices.Apple has also been developing a new Apple TV box with a faster processor for improved gaming and an upgraded remote control, however that device might not ship until next year, according to people familiar with its development. The company is working on a feature for the new remote similar to Find My iPhone that would make the TV accessory easier to find. The company’s other product in development is called AirTags, designed for locating physical items, which will be equipped with a leather carrying case, Bloomberg News has reported.(Updates with Apple shares in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-preparing-75-million-5g-040000022.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-31	2020-08-31 04:13:36	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	China’s Chip Executives Worry They’re Next on U.S. Hit List	(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks Covid-19’s impact on trade. Sign up here, and subscribe to our Covid-19 podcast for the latest news and analysis on the pandemic.Dozens of senior Chinese government officials and business leaders gathered at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference last week, but their usual agenda of trumpeting the nation’s chip innovation was colored by fears their industry might be next to suffer trade sanctions from the Trump administration.The White House’s campaign to contain China’s tech ascendancy has already shaken up the world’s technology supply chain and further restrictions would seriously set back China’s still-developing chip industry, executives including Legend Capital Co.’s Arthur Ge and Wang Xuguang, chief executive officer of AINSTEC, said at the conference last week. That’s despite the resiliency in China’s chip demand, which has been supported by a recovery in manufacturing following disruptions during the coronavirus pandemic.“If the U.S. further hit key areas of Chinese tech industry, for example the advanced chip manufacturing, the impact would be devastating,” said Ge, managing director of Legend Capital, an investment arm of the parent of Lenovo Group Ltd.The White House this month slapped new restrictions on exports to Huawei Technologies Co. amid an escalating standoff between the two largest economies that has already ensnared other Chinese tech giants like Tencent Holdings Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd. The latest rules required any chip companies using U.S. technologies to seek licenses before working for Huawei, effectively closing off the loopholes that the Chinese corporation had explored after earlier curbs that threatened the survival of its chipmaking unit HiSilicon.The U.S. is considering new restrictions on exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and associated software tools, lasers, sensors and other technology, Reuters reported last week. Already, Synopsys Inc., the Mountain View, California-based provider of electronic design automation (EDA) tools, has suspended cooperation with Huawei following the U.S. curbs, China Chairman Ge Qun said at the conference.“The entire chip industry is too fragile to defend itself. We are at least 20 years behind comparing to Silicon Valley from scale and quality of talent to size of the ecosystem,” said Wang of AINSTEC, a Suzhou-based company that develops 3D visual chips. “If we can prosper (with the U.S.), that’s the best, but if the situation doesn’t allow this to happen, we need to think what we have on our hands.”For its part, the Chinese government has stepped up efforts to defend domestic tech companies and increase the industry’s self-sufficiency. This month, it rolled out a series of measures that include tax breaks, tariff exemptions and investment incentives to bolster chipmakers and software producers.Local corporations are also boosting investments in research and development, with state-backed Tsinghua Unigroup building a $22 billion memory chip plant in the city of Wuhan. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. recently completed a secondary listing in Shanghai, raising more than $7.6 billion that would be used to develop next-generation chipmaking technologies to compete with rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Tsinghua Unigroup and SMIC, along with HiSilicon and Cambricon Technologies Corp., are among a handful of homegrown firms that are engaged in advanced chip manufacturing.“Although no one wants to say this, the world is approaching a new cold war era. I’m afraid this trend will get stronger in the future,” said Li Xing, co-founder of Beijing-based private equity company V Fund and a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive. “However, the challenge could become an opportunity for the industry” as China seeks local replacements.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-chip-executives-worry-next-041336342.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-18	2020-08-18 04:16:04	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Trump Just Took the Nuclear Option on Huawei	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A new U.S. edict limiting Huawei Technologies Co.'s access to technology is more than just an incremental measure against the Chinese telecommunications giant. It threatens to kill the company, which invites retaliation from Beijing.In May, the administration of President Donald Trump mandated that manufacturers globally couldn’t use American technology to produce chips designed by Huawei.At first, that also threatened chief supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., until it became clear that a legal workaround was available: Let Huawei buy chips that it didn’t design. As a result, Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc. stepped into the breach and quickly became the biggest purveyor of key 5G smartphone components, which are made by TSMC.It looked like a kind of win-win for everyone. Washington could curb Huawei’s semiconductor development, and by extension Beijing’s ambitions; Taiwan, a key U.S. ally, got a revenue boost; and Huawei itself would still survive even if its technology was hobbled.But that wan’t enough for the Trump administration.On Monday the Commerce Department expanded its foreign-produced direct product rule to include situations “where U.S. software or technology is the basis for a foreign-produced item” that will be used by Huawei, or where the company is party to such a transaction, such as being an intermediary supplier.This is Trump launching a nuclear warhead aimed directly at Huawei. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo basically acknowledges as much. There are dozens of steps in developing, manufacturing and installing chips in a device, with U.S. technology an integral part throughout. Synopsys Inc. and Cadence Design Systems Inc. make software used to design semiconductors; Lam Research Corp. and Applied Materials Inc. are major suppliers of manufacturing equipment — all four companies are based in Silicon Valley.There are many more American technology providers crucial to the process. Remove just one, and any chip company will struggle to keep up. Removing them all would be akin to cutting off the oxygen. And if the new rule is to be strictly interpreted, then even the use of generalist technologies like PCs running on Microsoft Corp.’s Windows and Intel Corp. processors could be prohibited.Huawei might, just might, be able to cobble together a patchwork of suppliers that not only are non-American but don’t even use U.S. technology. But this backup solution would be far inferior to that available to global peers, and any effort would be full of landmines — even if Huawei doesn’t care about upsetting the U.S. (that horse has bolted), every single non-American company it deals with, even Chinese, will be rightfully paranoid about putting a foot wrong.More importantly, such an alternative supply chain will take time, which China doesn’t have. Despite billions of dollars in spending and investment, the nation still significantly lags behind the U.S. in semiconductor technology. This is a fast-moving industry where even the best can struggle, as Intel Corp. has found.Spending a year reconfiguring Huawei’s design and development process would widen that gap, keeping in mind that the world’s leaders — such as Qualcomm Inc., Apple Inc., TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. — continue to move forward, and do so thanks to a globally integrated industry.I predicted a while ago that the technology sector would become bifurcated. Companies, and countries, will be forced to choose which side of the aisle they’re on. Both Beijing and Washington are to blame for this — the Great Firewall was built well before Trump came on the scene. As the underdog, China has no choice but to soldier on, and Huawei is both the symbol and the incarnation of this great battle.“I don’t think the Chinese government will just watch and let Huawei be slaughtered on a chopping board,” its rotating chairman Eric Xu said in March. “I believe the Chinese government will also take some countermeasures.”Just because there’s a missile heading toward Huawei doesn’t mean it will land. The U.S. left open the option for licensing access, there’s still a trade deal to hammer out, and a presidential election in November could see a change of administration.Yet the threat is real and Beijing has no technology with which to fight back. That means we’re into asymmetric warfare. China might not have chips, but it has much of the supply chain within its borders and the world’s second-largest economy. Oh, and it also holds $1.1 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities and $3 trillion in forex reserves.We shouldn’t expect a clean fight.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-08-18	2020-08-18 01:36:37	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	U.S. Announces New Curbs on Huawei Access to U.S. Technology	(Bloomberg) -- The Commerce Department announced further restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co. aimed at cutting the Chinese company’s access to commercially available chips, the latest move in an increasingly tense relationship between the world’s two biggest economies.The changes, which the department announced in a written statement on Monday, build on restrictions announced in May, adding 38 Huawei affiliates in 21 countries to an economic blacklist as the U.S. seeks to limit adoption of the company’s 5G technology.“We don’t want their equipment in the United States because they spy on us,” President Donald Trump said Monday in an interview on “Fox and Friends.”The move is the latest tit-for-tat in escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing over everything from the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic to China’s increasingly tight grip over Hong Kong. Despite the U.S. decision, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Fox Business that talks with China continue on various levels.The restrictions are likely to further hit both Huawei’s 5G base stations and smartphone businesses because it relies heavily on foreign chips to make those, further denting China’s ambition to play a key role in global rollout of 5G technology. Huawei’s stockpiles of certain self-designed chips essential to telecom equipment will run out by early 2021.Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB stand to benefit from Huawei’s further faltering in its 5G prowess, while domestic smartphone rivals including Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo are likely to get a bigger pie of the Chinese market.Ross said the action was aimed at closing loopholes the company explored after previous U.S. actions. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo praised the move as a “direct blow” against the Chinese Communist Party.Shares of Huawei suppliers dropped sharply in Taiwan Tuesday morning after the U.S. announced the new curbs.A Huawei spokesperson said Tuesday that the company was still reviewing the impact internally and that it had no immediate comment. China’s Foreign Ministry didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment sent via WeChat. Huawei has long rejected accusations that its technology can be used to spy on foreign nations or companies. All chip companies working for Huawei, no matter where they are, will be subject to licenses, a Commercial official said, adding that even foreign companies will be affected as long as they use U.S. design software and equipment.That means major Asian and European chip companies such as MediaTek Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., NXP Semiconductors NV, and STMicroelectronics NV may need a license to continue shipping to Huawei, though the official declined to name any specific company.There are few semiconductor companies in the world, including those in China, that do not rely on software from U.S.-based Synopsys Inc. and Cadence Design Systems Inc. to create blueprints for chips. Many companies that make physical chips, including China’s own Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., use equipment from U.S.-based Applied Materials Inc. and Lam Reserach Corp.‘Significant Disruption’Among Synopsys and Cadence’s customers, Taiwan’s MediaTek has become a main chip provider to Huawei after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said it will no longer ship chips to the Chinese company after Sept. 15. That’s due to the U.S.’s export-control rules added in May, which forbade companies from making chips based on Huawei’s design using American equipment.John Neuffer, the president and chief executive officer of the U.S.’s Semiconductor Industry Association, said the rule “will bring significant disruption” to the sector.“We are surprised and concerned by the administration’s sudden shift from its prior support of a more narrow approach intended to achieve stated national-security goals while limiting harm to U.S. companies,” Neuffer said in a statement. “We reiterate our view that sales of non-sensitive, commercial products to China drive semiconductor research and innovation here in the U.S., which is critical to America’s economic strength and national security.”The latest U.S. restrictions on Huawei are negative for European chipmakers, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts said in a note, adding that a key risk for firms such as STMicroelectronics, AMS AG and Dialog Semiconductor PLC is Chinese retaliatory restrictions on major customer Apple Inc.Additionally, assemblers that incorporate Huawei or third-party chips into their devices for the benefit of Huawei will also need to apply for a license, according to the Commerce official. That means Huawei smartphones assemblers, including Hong Kong-listed Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd., may be restricted by the new rules.(Updates with requests for comment, market moves.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-announces-curbs-huawei-access-160022752.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-08-17	2020-08-17 17:48:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	IBM tosses hat into AMD's ring with 7-nanometer CPU	International Business Machines Corp.  appears to be going after a piece of the 7-nanometer central processing unit market currently dominated by Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  with its own chip. Late Sunday, IBM said it was launching its Power10 chip, a 7-nm CPU to focus on the enterprise hybrid cloud computing market. In chip parlance, nanometers, or nm, refers to the size of the transistors that go on a computer chip, with the general rule being that smaller transistors are faster and more efficient in using power. All year, AMD has been releasing new versions of its 7-nm chip, which is fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. . Back in July, larger AMD rival Intel Corp.  said it was delaying its 7-nm chip  to at least late 2022 because of manufacturing issues. IBM said Samsung Electronics Co.  fabricates the Power10. IBM shares were down 0.3% at $124.87 at last check.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ca779a8c-6c7f-3ba6-a51b-9638d3a7dd32/ibm-tosses-hat-into-amd%26%2339%3Bs.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-08-17	2020-08-17 15:31:56	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Unusual Options Activity Insight: Taiwan Semiconductor	On Monday, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $80.39.  * Sentiment: NEUTRAL  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-08-21  * Strike Price: $80.00  * Volume: 1861  * Open Interest: 47603 Indications of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume is one way options activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.Another gauge of unusual options activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are &quot;out of the money&quot; are also indicative of unusual options activity. &quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Analyzing Taiwan Semiconductor's Unusual Options Activity(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-11	2020-08-11 21:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple’s Climate Promise Depends on Taiwan Partners Going Green	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has gone carbon neutral. But in order to say the same for its flagship iPhone, it’s going to need help from Taiwan.More than three-quarters of the emissions that come from making Apple’s ubiquitous products come from outside suppliers, according to the company’s Environmental Progress Report. That includes Taiwanese electronics giants like TSMC and Foxconn, which still get about 90% of their power from non-renewable sources, according to company reports.That’s changing though. The firms are installing solar panels and buying power from offshore wind farms in line with Apple’s target of having all of its products be carbon-neutral by 2030. It underscores how climate pressure is increasingly coming not only from activists, but from within company’s own supply chains.“What Apple and other companies are trying to do is contribute to meeting Paris climate targets by decarbonizing their own footprints and making it a precondition for their partners and suppliers to use renewable energy,” said Prakash Sharma, director for the energy transition practice at consultancy Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “It’s gaining momentum because more and more companies are moving in that direction.”So far 71 of Apple’s hundreds of suppliers have committed to using only renewable energy, about 8 gigawatts worth, or more than the peak power demand for the entire nation of Singapore. Once completed, these commitments will avoid over 14.3 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually— the equivalent of taking more than 3 million cars off the road each year.Taiwanese companies make up an outsize proportion of Apple’s suppliers worldwide because of their dominance of sectors such as contract manufacturing and made-to-order semiconductors. Linchpins of Apple’s manufacturing machine include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which exclusively makes cutting-edge chips for Apple’s iPhones and iPads in Taiwan, and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., also known as Foxconn, which assembles more than 100 million iPhones annually. Both firms recently agreed to join the renewable energy drive.Wind and solar power can be as cheap as fossil fuels, but they don’t produce at all hours of the day, so it isn’t feasible for major factories to run directly on renewables alone. Improvements in battery technology might soon change that, but at the moment Apple isn’t pushing its suppliers in that direction.Instead, Apple wants them to invest in enough renewable energy in their home region to cover their power use. That way even if a factory requires coal-fired electricity in the middle of the night, it will have invested in enough wind or solar to keep an equivalent amount of coal from being burned at other times.For Foxconn, that means installing solar panels on the roofs and of its campuses in places like Henan province in China, where coal is still the dominant source for power. The company had installed 224 megawatts of clean energy by the end of 2019, up from 33 in 2017. But it still has a long way to go, as solar power and renewable energy credits amounted to only about 10% of its power use last year, the company said in its sustainability report.TSMC, which used renewable energy and credits for 6.7% of its power in 2019, has committed to producing renewable energy for its entire operations by 2050. It signed a deal last month with Orsted A/S to buy all of the power from a 920-megawatt wind farm the Danish company is developing off the coast of Taiwan, in what is the world’s largest private renewable power deal. The deal means TSMC now actually has agreements to buy more clean energy than Apple, according to BloombergNEF.The company’s efforts have been aided by a massive Taiwanese government plan to transform the country’s energy mix away from coal and nuclear and toward renewables and natural gas. The Orsted deal, for example, came after the wind-maker had established a major presence in the company thanks to several government-backed deals for offshore wind farms.“Growing sustainability initiatives by major companies are definitely making a dent in their supply chains,” said Jonathan Luan, a Beijing-based analyst with BloombergNEF. “Some companies have been able to change market rules to achieve their goals, like in Taiwan.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-climate-promise-depends-taiwan-210000757.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-08-11	2020-08-11 08:25:07	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	SoftBank Gives Up Pretending It Isn't a Fund	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- SoftBank Group Corp. has given up pretending to operate anything.Once the owner of two telecom companies and a collection of other operating businesses, the Japanese conglomerate would report quarterly operating profit and net income.That’s how most normal companies do it. In days past, the former category included profits from Sprint Corp. and Softbank Corp., as well as operating income from the SoftBank Vision Fund, but excluded gains or losses from other investments.On Tuesday, SoftBank announced it will no longer bother reporting operating income, instead “gain (loss) on investments will be used in order to show investment performance in the consolidated financial results.” The catalyst was the sale of Sprint to T-Mobile US Inc., meaning that the U.S. mobile operator is no longer a consolidated entity. The change makes sense. SoftBank hasn’t “operated” anything for a while, instead cobbling together a growing pile of investments both within the Vision Fund (such as ByteDance Ltd. and Uber Technologies Inc.) and outside (including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and domestically listed telco Softbank Corp.).In the June quarter, the major driver of earnings was the sale of shares in T-Mobile. A year earlier, it was a rise in the value of its stake in Alibaba. SoftBank Corp. continues to provide a handy income stream.With the Vision Fund’s $98.6 billion almost fully invested, there’s not much left to be done hunting for unicorns and handing out fat checks. Earnings from the fund, generally based on mark-to-market valuation changes, fell 39% for the period.This shift in reporting may be all the more relevant in light of one of the few remaining companies that SoftBank controls, but which is neither listed nor controlled by the Vision Fund: Arm Ltd.SoftBank seems desperate to offload the British semiconductor company  just four years after acquiring it for $32 billion. My colleague Alex Webb and myself recently advised against an IPO because the unit’s revenue has slowed and SoftBank would get a better price if it waited for a pickup in demand for new devices like internet of things and self-driving cars. The news flow over the past few weeks indicates that Softbank Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son and his team have been doing the hard sell, with names like Nvidia Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Foxconn Technology Group all in the mix.Should a sale go through, even a partial divestiture, the pool of companies that Son’s team controls will shrink further. I’d hazard that we could see a further offloading of its shares in SoftBank Corp., too.These moves would put even more of the burden of earnings on returns from its portfolio of investments, of which Alibaba remains the largest. Today, SoftBank Group’s net asset value can largely be tracked in real time simply by following the stocks it owns. Sadly, the company just took a back step backward for transparency by announcing Tuesday that it would no long post daily updates on its website.For investors, the reporting shift highlights the truth of what SoftBank Group has become: a fancy, highly managed fund — a hedge fund, perhaps — whose returns ought to be benchmarked against indexes of its peers and not as the technology company Son once ran. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-08-10	2020-08-10 03:03:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Asia Tech-Shares Selloff Seen as Buy Opportunity for Some Funds	(Bloomberg) -- Friday’s attack by President Donald Trump on WeChat may have pushed many investors to offload Asia’s technology shares. But for some, the selloff has presented a good buying opportunity.Jian Shi Cortesi, a fund manager at GAM Investment Management in Zurich, bought some Chinese internet stocks on Friday and plans to further increase holdings if the stock prices pull back more.“The U.S. ban on Chinese internet companies will have little impact on the revenue and earnings of most listed Chinese internet companies,” Cortesi said in an interview. Her Asia Focus Equity Fund has a third of its investments in internet stocks, and beat 93% of its peers in the past year. “It hurts sentiment, which could push the stock prices lower and create an opportunity to buy.”Trump’s escalation of his confrontation with Beijing, banning U.S. residents from doing business with TikTok and WeChat apps, wiped about $77 billion off the four largest Asia technology firms’ valuations on Friday and highlighted the political risks faced by regional companies, particularly those in China.But Asian tech bulls aren’t flinching.“President Trump’s noise provides a buying opportunity,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office in Singapore. “Valuations are low on international comparisons and many are globally extremely competitive.”WeChat operator Tencent Holdings Ltd. fell another 3.4% on Monday. Its peer Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. also declined 2.7%. Technology stocks in the U.S. had a selloff Friday as investors took note of the stepped up confrontation with China.Read: Tencent Shares Fall Further as Worries About U.S. Action PersistThe value of the four largest stocks on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, all of them tech firms, still lag behind their American peers. The group -- Alibaba, Tencent, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. -- trade at an average of 25 times estimated profit for the next year, versus the 34 times of the more familiar tech giants atop the S&P 500 Index.The valuation gap had been narrowing since June, when the Asian companies traded at their cheapest since 2015. JPMorgan Asset Management’s Oliver Cox, who manages the JPMorgan Pacific Technology Fund, says the U.S.-China tiff doesn’t change the long-term story. He believes Asia has been repeating many of the U.S. trends in an earlier stage of evolution.That implies “a much faster growth rate, more promising outlook and therefore greater upside potential for Asia Pacific tech stocks compared with the more mature, slower-growth U.S. names,” he said. The four Asia tech titans gained an average 22% this year, lagging behind a 40% average gain in their U.S. peers.“The gap could be closer,” Pruksa Iamthongthong, a senior investment director for Asian equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said of the valuation difference. “On a three-year trajectory we will see a clear pathway on how they want to monetize businesses that they have invested in a long time ago.”Alibaba, Tencent Hold Their Lead as New IT Hastens Fintech ShiftStill, U.S. capital markets remain by far the deepest, most diverse, and most attractive in the world, said Andy Wong, senior multi-asset investment manager at Pictet Asset Management, adding U.S. leadership in shareholder value, corporate governance, liquidity, and innovation warrants a higher multiple.Yet a weakening U.S. dollar may also prompt foreign investors to look at foreign assets, and Asia tech presents good opportunities given structural growth drivers, according to Suresh Tantia, a senior investment strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG.(Updates share prices in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-tencent-risks-asia-tech-020909971.html?.tsrc=rss

The relentless ascent in NVDA stock has been fueled by an extremely bullish backdrop in the broader tech sector and the semiconductor industry.Source: Hairem / Shutterstock.com Altogether, their charts tell tales of trend continuation and momentum feedback loops. Investors second-guessing the goodness due to economic worries or valuation concerns have entirely missed out on the NVDA stock run.To celebrate the record-shattering week, I want to break down the boom in tech and identify the best ways to trade Nvidia now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Top-Down AnalysisWe don't live in a world where individual stocks rise and fall on their own merits alone. They are, to one degree or another, influenced by the undercurrent of broad market trends and sector shifts. A good company in an out-of-favor sector gets penalized. Its wings are clipped by soured sentiment, limiting its ability to fly. Alternatively, a weak company in a favored sector receives a tailwind. It's not a blessing born of good behavior. It's a byproduct of being in the right place at the right time.This reality is why traders should always keep an eye on the tone and trends of the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and other major indices.  * 7 Travel Stocks to Buy Banking On Pent-Up Demand The same goes for keeping tabs on sector performance. Knowing what is leading or lagging can be a huge time saver in discovering profitable opportunities as you explore the vast tundra of tickers.The above explanation highlights the essence of top-down analysis. Moving from index to sector to stock allows for more informed decision-making and, ultimately, a higher success rate with your stock picking. Enter NVDA StockThe fast-growing company sits in the semiconductor industry of the technology sector. And both are on fire. With Thursday marking yet another record high, the Nasdaq Composite has now risen 67% off the March low. The epic magnitude of the rise has been matched by its consistency.Dip buyers have been as reliable as a clock, emerging to buy every single dip to the rising 20-day moving average.Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade There is no denying mega-cap stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have done the heavy lifting, but the semiconductor industry has also been a growth engine for tech. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) has risen 79% from the March bottom.After Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Nvidia is the second-largest holding. NVDA stock hasn't been a backseat passenger during the now five-month trip. It has been driving the bus. Compared to the Nasdaq's 67% gain, and the semiconductor industry's rise of 79%, Nvidia has climbed 153% since March.Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade In conclusion, we have a leading stock in a leading industry in the leading sector. That's about as bullish a combination as you'll find in the field of technical analysis. Beware the Asymmetric Risk vs. RewardSource: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade NVDA stock is working on its eighth up day in a row. Like all momentum feedback loops, it seems the higher the stock goes, the stronger it looks. But here's where my inner risk radar starts going off. I'm not a fan of buying something that has already risen eight days in a row. The risk/reward ratio is out of whack, where the downside starts to outweigh the remaining upside. Tack on the looming earnings report on August 19 and buyers are running out of time if they want to enter and exit a trade before the next binary event strikes.You have two choices.First, sit on the sidelines and wait for a better setup to form. Nvidia has developed many pullbacks along the way after reaching short-term overbought conditions. There's no reason we won't see something similar this go around.Second, if you want to jump on the momentum train and bet that the eight-day rally can extend itself to a ninth, tenth or eleventh session, then at least use a tight stop so when the inevitable retracement arrives you don't ride it back down.For a free trial to the best trading community on the planet and Tyler's current home, click here!

2020-08-05	2020-08-05 22:00:02	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	A Taiwan Tech Company Bigger Than Foxconn (Not TSMC)	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When the U.S. administration moved in May to block Huawei Technologies Co. from accessing American technology to manufacture its chips, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. dropped.Huawei, the Chinese phone and telecoms equipment giant, was one of the custom chipmaker’s biggest clients and losing those orders was thought to pose a huge threat to revenue. Yet that same day, shares of another Taiwanese company jumped as much as their daily 10% limit, the most in almost five years.MediaTek Inc., a designer of chips used in electronics including smartphones, has since climbed another 78% in Taiwan and by late July overtook the market value of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the Taipei-based flagship of iPhone maker Foxconn Technology Group. At the close of trade Wednesday, MediaTek was Taiwan’s second-biggest company, worth NT$1.2 trillion ($40 billion). The new rule from the Trump administration stated that chip manufacturers such as TSMC cannot use American know-how to make semiconductors for Huawei, accusing the Chinese company of undertaking “malign activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.” Since U.S. equipment, software and materials are an irreplaceable part of chip manufacturing, the edict meant that Huawei can no longer use its own chips in its devices.But Huawei’s smartphones, routers, switches and other hardware can use chips designed by outside parties, even if they’re manufactured with American technology. Enter MediaTek.It designs 5G chips for both smartphones and base stations, and has them manufactured by TSMC, making it the perfect replacement for the Huawei-designed chips that can no longer be made.Already a supplier to the Chinese company, MediaTek’s orders from Huawei are reported to have jumped after the restrictions, spurring analysts to raise their outlook for 2020 revenue by 14% and for next year by 29%.This wasn’t some fluke, though, or merely being in the right place at the right time. Founded by M.K. Tsai, a U.S.-educated electrical engineer and  early leader of Taiwan’s chip industry, MediaTek has made a career out of being the backup quarterback in the world’s most ubiquitous devices.Once a division of United Microelectronics Corp., TSMC’s smaller rival in the chip foundry business, the company was spun off and listed in 2001. All three are based in Taiwan’s Hsinchu Science Park. When it gained independence, CD-ROMs and DVDs were hot, and MediaTek made the chips which powered them. It’s been riding the electronics revolution ever since and Tsai was later named among the world’s best-performing chief executive officers by the Harvard Business Review. When Blu-ray players were introduced, it became a key supplier of components. By the time Bluetooth became standard in gadgets, later to include mobile phones, MediaTek had cheaper offerings than its rivals. Wi-Fi was another big boon to the company.In many cases, MediaTek didn’t have the first or even the best product in the market, but it consistently found a way to balance performance with cost, and leverage a huge uptake in a hip new technology that would invariably force prices down. Competitors were often left flat-footed, offering higher-priced chips when MediaTek’s components were considered acceptable while being far cheaper.When mobile telephony came along, particularly the 3G technology that enabled the mobile internet, MediaTek was recognized as a serious player. Before long, it was not only designing networking chips but the core processor that runs a smartphone or tablet, treading on turf dominated by Qualcomm Inc. It went one step further, offering reference designs — recipes for how to make a smartphone — whereas Qualcomm tended to just sell the chip and let device manufacturers figure out the rest.MediaTek’s semiconductors, and Google’s free Android operating system, gave rise to a boom in smartphones that could be made for as little as $20 apiece. It has since developed high-end chips with artificial intelligence capabilities. One parlor trick: using MediaTek-powered phones to follow human movement and mimic it on a robot.Now, there’s 5G.With Chinese smartphone brands like Huawei, Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo already clients, and China itself being the earliest adopter of this faster networking standard, MediaTek stands poised to benefit. It helps that its closest rival, Qualcomm, is an American company in the midst of a U.S.-China tech cold war.Its new mobile chipsets may be installed on more than 40% of 5G devices launched in China, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum writes, adding to the strength it already enjoys in the market for Wi-Fi and power-management components it supplies to the likes of Amazon.com Inc., Xiaomi and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.MediaTek has built a good business from being a smaller, less-famous name from a little-known place in Taiwan. With Beijing-Washington tensions heating up, it now finds itself at the center of the action. The trick will be to remain indispensable without becoming collateral damage.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

AMD shares spent Tuesday carving out new intraday records, and were last up 8.5% at $84.30, on track for a new closing record. The stock last closed at a record $78.20 on July 30, fresh from AMD's strong earnings and indications that the company's share gain from Intel Corp.  was quickening. At current levels, AMD is about $1 billion shy of breaking a $100 billion market cap. In a Tuesday note, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis, who has a buy rating on AMD, raised his price target on AMD to $95 from $86. Lipacis said the lead of AMD, and its chip fabricator Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , over Intel appeared &quot;systemic.&quot; Lipacis said he expects AMD share gains to accelerate especially in the server market, with an estimated 30% share over the next two to three years, and 50% in four to five years. In its recent earnings call, AMD said it had just reached 10% share of the server market. Of the 36 analysts who cover AMD, 15 have overweight or buy ratings, 18 have hold ratings, and three have sell ratings, with an average price target of $75.76, according to FactSet data.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/714c0fda-a528-34bd-baf7-0edf81c719b8/amd-stock-surges-to-new.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-30	2020-07-30 14:51:02	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Semiconductor Short Sellers Take $800M Hit From AMD Earnings Beat	Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) shares jumped 12.8% following the company's second-quarter earnings beat this week. Semiconductor stocks traded higher in sympathy with AMD, and short sellers took a major beating.In fact, semiconductor short sellers took an $800.3 million paper loss on Wednesday, according to S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky. AMD was responsible for the lion's share of those losses, as AMD short sellers took a $495.6 million hit.But AMD short sellers weren't alone. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares were up 2.8%, hitting short sellers with an $87 million loss. Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) shares were up 6.8%, costing short sellers $87.1 million.Dusaniwsky said AMD has the largest outstanding short position of any stock in the semiconductor group at $3.53 billion followed closely by Nvidia at $3.13 billion.&quot;Based on year-to-date and today's mark-to-market losses there is a good chance we see short covering in AMD, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor as some shorts get squeezed out of their positions,&quot; Dusaniwsky said.Tough Year For Semi Shorts: Year to date, AMD short sellers have endured mark-to-market losses of $1.96 billion, making AMD the worst semiconductor short of 2020. Nvidia short sellers have taken a $1.77 billion loss, while Taiwan Semiconductor short sellers are down $404.9 million.At the same time, not all semiconductor short sellers are getting fried in 2020. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) short sellers have turned a $446.7 million profit year-to-date, and Microchip Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MCHP) short sellers have gained $335 million in 2020.Overall, however, 2020 has been a disaster for semiconductor short sellers, which have logged aggregate year-to-date mark-to-market losses of $4.2 billion.Benzinga's Take: Short selling is inherently a dangerous venture, and shorting momentum stocks like AMD and Nvidia has been a losing trade in recent years. Given Intel's ongoing struggles producing its 7 nanometer chips, AMD could continue to bleed short sellers for the foreseeable future.Related Links:What Mark Cuban Says Could Be The Greatest Threat To America's Tech, Military Future Is Now The Time To Short Tesla's Stock?Latest Ratings for AMD  DateFirmActionFromTo  Jul 2020JP MorganMaintainsNeutral  Jul 2020Piper SandlerMaintainsOverweight  Jul 2020UBSMaintainsNeutral    View More Analyst Ratings for AMD   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * Nvidia Option Trader Bets .3M On Near-Term Upside  * Option Traders Make Big Bullish Bets On AMD, Texas Instruments(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-30	2020-07-30 02:51:46	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Samsung Beats Earnings Estimates on Recovery of Chips, Gadget Sales	(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. beat earnings estimates and gave a cautiously optimistic outlook, predicting that new smartphones and gaming consoles will boost demand for memory chips in the second half of the year.Net income increased to 5.5 trillion won ($4.6 billion) in the three months ended June, the company said in a filing on Thursday, compared with the 4.9 trillion won average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The South Korean company had reported preliminary numbers earlier this month that showed operating profit rose 23%.Samsung, which is the world’s largest smartphone maker and also supplies components like memory chips, is navigating the tumult of the coronavirus pandemic, along with the rest of the tech industry. The company warned of a slump in its consumer business in the second quarter. But sales of smartphones, televisions and other gadgets have started to recover, and the company said demand is likely to get a boost from the introduction of new game consoles and phone models, expected from Apple Inc. and Samsung itself.“Covid-19 continues to cloud the demand outlook but structurally speaking, the demand is there,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anthea Lai said. “We’re getting there to have more 5G smartphones coming from Samsung and the expectation in the second half is to have more demand from consumers.”Samsung shares rose as much as 1.9% in Seoul trading, pushing gains this week to about 10%. The company said it would not provide annual financial guidance because of the coronavirus uncertainty.Though it’s best known abroad for its phones, Samsung makes most of its profit from memory chips, used in everything from phones and consoles to servers that help deliver online services like video and music. Samsung said it anticipates the overall DRAM market to be up.“Looking towards the second half, we do expect mobile demand overall to recover and also graphic demand to grow,” said Jinman Han, senior vice president of semiconductor business. “For servers, memory demand driven by stay-at-home activities seems to continue as Covid-19 and other uncertainties persist.”The company’s own mobile devices, set to be updated with flagship Galaxy Note and Galaxy Z Fold releases shortly, are expected to improve revenue on a quarterly basis, but the company underlined that uncertainties related to Covid-19 will continue.“We also think that customers may have increased their inventories during the 1H, so another variable to the second half demand is the direction of our customers’ inventory management,” said Han.Samsung shares rose earlier in the week on news of Intel Corp.’s delayed 7nm chip production and likely need to outsource some future chipmaking to the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Samsung is one of the few companies equipped to handle advanced semiconductor manufacturing, and the potential to garner more Intel business boosted market sentiment.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysSamsung’s foundry business could benefit from Intel’s chipmaking retreat as industry leader TSMC may have a tight production schedule to fulfill the U.S. company’s demand. Samsung is already a supplier of Intel CPUs based on the 14-nanometer process.&#92;- Anthea Lai, analystClick here for the research.Aside from the impact of Covid-19, geopolitical issues are also likely to reposition the global supply chain in a way that will affect Samsung’s business. Bans on Huawei Technologies Co. in the U.S. and U.K. open more opportunities for Samsung to sell 5G networking gear and smartphones.The mobile division of the world’s largest smartphone maker posted a 25% increase in operating income to 1.95 trillion won. The Korean giant is expecting smartphone sales to rise in the third quarter with the launch of new Android devices including its foldable phone lineup but warned of intensifying market competition among smartphone makers that will strive to make up for weak performances during the pandemic.Read more: Samsung Teases New Mobile Gadgets For a Stay-at-Home Generation“There is a possibility that the Galaxy Fold 2 will become a game changer in the smartphone ecosystem,” said Greg Roh, senior vice president at HMC Securities. “Most of the shortcomings found in the preceding model have been overcome with the ultra thin glass and a larger display.”Samsung’s display division, which supplies organic light-emitting-diode-screens for Apple’s iPhones, posted operating profit of 300 billion won. Although the display business suffered as the smartphone market slumped due to the virus, the loss was offset by reimbursement from Apple. Analysts have said the amount of payment was about 1.1 trillion won.The consumer electronics unit, which includes TVs and appliances, posted 730 billion won of profit. Samsung expects a recovery in TVs and digital appliances in the second half of this year thanks to pent-up demand after the virus lockdowns and holiday spending.(Updates with details from earnings call from third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-beats-earnings-estimates-recovery-002312121.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-29	2020-07-29 12:00:17	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	3 ETFs Enjoying The Benefits of Taiwan Semiconductor Exposure	It fell 7.6% on Tuesday, but the rally by shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) has been nothing short of breathtaking.The semiconductor foundry company nearly doubled off its March lows and, along the way, became one of the 10 largest companies in the world by market capitalization. With a market value of about $350 billion, Taiwan Semiconductor is larger than any U.S.-based chip name and roughly $100 billion bigger than both Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).The Taiwanese semiconductor Goliath also is also acting as the primary driver behind its home country's performance as one of 2020's best-performing emerging markets, meaning plenty of exchange-traded funds, including some oft-overlooked names, are benefiting from TSM bullishness.Here are a few that fit that bill.iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF (EWT)The iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF (NYSE: EWT) is the largest ETF dedicated to stocks in that country and it devotes more than 27% of its weight to the locally listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, good for one of the largest allocations to that stock among all ETFs.That hefty exposure is working in favor of investors this year as EWT is higher by almost 9% compared to a loss of 2.53% for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, a benchmark in which Taiwan is one of the largest country weights. However, there are some risks with that big TSM weight.&quot;Investors who want to maintain exposure to Taiwan and its dynamic, Tech-oriented economy may wish to reduce exposure to TSMC, either by partially shorting shares of TSM to offset the exposure from EWT, or by switching to an ETF with less concentration in Taiwan Semi,&quot; according to the ETF Research Center (ETFRC).Alpha Architect Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF (FRDM)Up almost 9% over the past month, the Alpha Architect Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF (CBOE: FRDM) is benefiting from a more than 11.2% weight to TSM, putting it in rare air among U.S.-listed ETFs.That performance is all the more admirable when considering FRDM's freedom weighting methodology, one should investors well over the long haul, excludes Chinese stocks.&quot;One such fund we like and have highlighted before is the Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF,&quot; according to ETFRC. &quot;It has about 11% allocated to TSMC (less than half of EWT's exposure), with about 25% of assets overall invested in Taiwanese stocks and another 20% invested in South Korea. And as we highlighted two weeks ago, companies in FRDM enjoy a higher growth rate than either EWT or the iShares MSCI South Korea ETF (NYS:EWY).VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) has a 15.34% weight to TSM, or nearly 700 basis points than it allocates to Nvidia, its second-largest holding. Additionally. SMH's TSM exposure is almost 1,000 basis points higher than what's found in the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index.See more from Benzinga  * 3 Unheralded Gold ETFs That Are On Fire  * Why These 2 Risky Silver ETFs Matter Now(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-29	2020-07-29 05:27:19	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Huawei Supplier Hires Ex-U.S. Official as China Tensions Grow	(Bloomberg) -- MediaTek Inc. has hired a former U.S. Department of Commerce official to help the Taiwanese chipmaker navigate worsening U.S.-China tensions that have already ensnared its customer Huawei Technologies Co.Patrick Wilson, who most recently served as director of the Office of Business Liaison for the Department of Commerce, will be appointed vice president of government affairs at MediaTek USA and lead its public policy initiatives, the company said in a draft press statement seen by Bloomberg News. Wilson previously worked at the Semiconductor Industry Association, where he led the trade group’s dealings with the federal government.Technology companies with ties to or operations in China have come under increasing scrutiny from Washington amid growing tensions with Beijing, forcing them to ramp up spending on lobbying efforts in the U.S. The Commerce Department said in May it would require licenses before allowing U.S. technology to be used by Huawei or its 114 subsidiaries, including its chip-design unit HiSilicon, thus preventing suppliers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. from shipping HiSilicon-designed parts to the Chinese company.Earlier this year, TSMC hired former Intel Corp. lobbyist Peter Cleveland, while ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese owner of the viral TikTok app that has also come under U.S. scrutiny, spent a record $500,000 on federal lobbying in the quarter ended June 30.Analysts are expecting Huawei to rely on MediaTek for more orders after TSMC said it will not ship new chips designed by HiSilicon after Sept. 15. MediaTek may supply its chips to Huawei for a flagship handset that may be introduced this year as the U.S. export controls impact supply from Qualcomm Inc. and TSMC, Sanford C. Bernstein analysts including Mark Li wrote in a July 23 note.MediaTek shares have gained about 150% since its March lows to close at NT$680 on July 28.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-supplier-hires-ex-u-052719534.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-29	2020-07-29 01:02:49	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	AMD Gains Chip Market Share at Intel’s Expense; Shares Surge	(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is gaining share in the lucrative market for server chips, the latest sign it’s benefiting from close ties to a major Taiwanese factory partner to win orders from larger rival Intel Corp. Shares surged in late trading.Strides in server chips will help propel third-quarter revenue to about $2.55 billion, Santa Clara, California-based AMD said Tuesday, topping analysts’ average prediction for $2.3 billion. The company also raised full-year sales forecasts, and second-quarter results beat Wall Street expectations. AMD stock climbed as much as 11% in extended trading after closing at $67.61 in New York.After decades of lagging behind Intel, AMD has been catching up in recent years, helped by advances at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips on its behalf. Intel, by contrast, has suffered a series of manufacturing setbacks, last week saying it’s fallen behind in a new method for cutting-edge semiconductors and that it’s considering scrapping a decades-old strategy of making chips in-house.The admissions sparked a selloff in Intel stock and underscored the ways Intel is being surpassed by TSMC, which in turn helps TSMC’s partners.AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said her bullish outlook is based on expectations that her company will keep adding share as new products gain wider adoption at computer makers. She said AMD has passed 10% share of the profitable server chip market and that while supply of leading-edge chips is “tight,” the company is confident it can meet increasing demand.AMD is also growing quickly in notebooks, she said. Demand for personal computers hasn’t been hurt by the Covid-19 pandemic as much as the company initially feared, she said on a conference call with analysts.“We delivered our highest client (PC) processor revenue in more than twelve years,” she said. “We believe our growth was largely driven by our eleventh straight quarter of market share gains.”Demand for chips for notebooks and servers will increase in the second half, Su said.Despite the optimism, Su reminded analysts that AMD is “in the early innnings” of its journey to where it expects to be.Intel’s announcement of further delays in improving its production does not change what AMD has to do, she said.“The most important thing for us is to execute to our commitments to our customers,” she said. “Basically what we’re asking is for people to trust us with their most important workloads.”Under Su, AMD has revamped its products and come surging back from what analysts had said was the brink of insolvency. Investors now want the company to justify its soaring valuation by growing to become more than just an afterthought to computer makers. The stock has almost doubled over the past year.On Tuesday, AMD said it sees 2020 revenue rising about 32%, driven by strength in PC, gaming and data center products. Wall Street expected the company’s sales to climb 25% this year to $8.4 billion. Either way, that is still about half what Intel books in one quarter.AMD’s achievement of its more than 10% interim server market target still puts it a long way from the more than 20% it achieved about 15 years ago. But it is up from less than 1% before introducing new products in 2017. Server computers are the backbone of corporate networks and the data centers that run the internet. Server chips can sell for thousands of dollars each.AMD reported second-quarter net income of $157 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with $35 million, or 3 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 26% to $1.93 billion. Profit, excluding certain items, was 18 cents. Analysts estimated profit of 16 cents on sales of $1.86 billion.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-gives-bullish-forecast-boosted-204453690.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-28	2020-07-28 17:13:55	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Analyzing Taiwan Semiconductor's Unusual Options Activity	Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) shares experienced unusual options activity on Tuesday. The stock price moved down to $76.65 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-15  * Strike Price: $70.00  * Volume: 786  * Open Interest: 20693 Indications of Unusual Options Activity One way option activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally high. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.Another gauge of unusual option activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.&quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. &quot;Out of the money&quot; occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Understanding Sentiment   * Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price  * Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask priceAlthough the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish option activity.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

As a result, Intel doesn't expect to launch its 7nm chips until 2022 and 2023.

Daily stock moves are capped at 10% in Taiwan’s equity market.It’s difficult to overstate the influence that TSMC wields on Taiwan’s financial markets. Making up almost a third of the local benchmark, it has single-handedly pushed the Taiex past a record that had stood for three decades. Its rally is attracting foreign flows into Taiwanese equities, increasing demand for the local currency. The Taiwan dollar rose 1% Tuesday to the strongest since April 2018.The latest boost to TSMC’s shares came after Intel Corp. warned last week that its 7-nanometer chips are behind schedule and it may outsource their production. The U.S. chipmaker is expected to funnel new business to TSMC, given its global lead in silicon fabrication and track record of making semiconductors for the world’s largest tech corporations.Intel’s struggles are buoying stocks in Asian suppliers of made-to-order chips. Samsung Electronics Co., which is investing heavily in its own foundry business, jumped as much as 5.8% Tuesday, its biggest intraday gain in almost two months. Chinese rival Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. climbed 6.6% in Hong Kong.“Samsung Electronics’ position as a foundry partner is expected to rise. Korean investors anticipate that Samsung could produce Intel’s CPU and discrete GPU,” Hana Financial Investment analysts wrote in a note. But “to narrow the gap with TSMC, it is essential for Samsung to expand its Austin fab.”A report on Monday suggested that Intel had placed orders with TSMC for 180,000 units of 6nm chips for 2021. Meanwhile, brokerages including Nomura Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG upgraded TSMC to the equivalent of buy.(Updates with share price and analyst comment from first paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-among-world-top-10-010633161.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-27	2020-07-27 15:01:24	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	What Mark Cuban Says Could Be The Greatest Threat To America's Tech, Military Future	Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) is still struggling to produce its next-generation chips containing 7-nanometer transistors, and Intel investors are likely losing patience with the company.Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban said on Sunday that Intel's problems could have much larger implications for the U.S. military.Last week, Intel said the company may have to outsource at least some of its 7nm chip production to third-party companies after once again delaying the release of the high-performance chips.Intel has already lost market share to competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) due to 7nm production delays, and Intel said on the company's earnings call that it has identified a problem with its 7nm production process.Cuban Reacts: On Twitter, Cuban said Intel's decision to outsource chip production could have major implications for the U.S. military.&quot;If Intel outsources manufacturing, the lack of domestic chip mfg could be the greatest threat to our technological and military future,&quot; he wrote.Cuban said advanced chips are at the heart of today's cutting-edge technology.&quot;We can not control our own destiny if we don't build here...If we want to protect our future, we need to make investments in manufacturing of chips and all advanced technologies a national priority or we will find ourselves on the outside looking in, wondering why we are no longer a global economic and military super power,&quot; Cuban said.Benzinga's Take: Following the news, Intel shares plummeted 16% Friday, while AMD shares jumped 17% and semiconductor foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) gained 10%.Until Intel gets its 7nm production on track, investors can expect AMD to continue to gain market share and third-party producers like Taiwan Semiconductor to benefit from potentially massive demand from Intel.Given the national security concerns referenced by Cuban, expect U.S. government pressure on Intel to revert back to full in-house production as soon as possible.Related Links:3 Top 5G Semiconductor Stock Picks From BofA Mark Cuban Channels Bernie Sanders: 'It's Time For Trickle Up Economics'See more from Benzinga  * How Market Fragmentation Hurts The Retail Trader  * Is Now The Time To Short Tesla's Stock?  * Twitter's User Growth Is Impressive, But There's Too Much Near-Term Uncertainty(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The $35 billion addition to its market capitalization makes TSMC the 12th most valuable stock worldwide, ahead of U.S. retail giant Walmart Inc. The chip producer for the likes of Apple Inc. wields so much influence over Taiwan’s 921-member stock benchmark that without it, the Taiex would be down about 2% this year versus its 5% gain.The latest boost to TSMC’s shares, which were already up 17% for the year before Monday, came after Intel Corp. warned last week that its 7-nanometer chips are behind schedule and it may outsource their production. The U.S. chipmaker is expected to funnel new business to TSMC, given its global lead in silicon fabrication and track record making semiconductors for the world’s largest tech corporations.TSMC’s $160 billion-plus rally since March follows a global tech resurgence and has resuscitated the local stock market. Like Japan, Taiwan saw a bubble in its equities burst three decades ago, and it’s been a long climb back.But with a global rush into tech shares pushing the Nasdaq Composite Index to a record this month, overseas investors sent more than $850 million into Taiwan’s tech-heavy stock market. That’s the largest net inflow among Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, with most of Taiwan’s likely going into TSMC. It makes up almost a third of the market-cap weighted Taiex. The inflows have also helped push Taiwan’s dollar to the strongest level versus the U.S. dollar since 2018.TSMC is among the few companies that have weathered the coronavirus outbreak without suffering a severe slowdown in business. Long-term investments in fifth-generation wireless technology and high-performance computing from its customers have sustained order volumes and the company even raised its 2020 outlook and expects capital expenditure to climb to as much as $17 billion.Read more: Intel Plunges as It Weighs Exit From Manufacturing ChipsA report on Monday suggested that Intel had placed orders with TSMC for 180,000 units of 6nm chips for 2021. Meanwhile, brokerages including Nomura Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG upgraded TSMC to the equivalent of buy.Aletheia Capital did as well, with analysts Stefan Chang and Warren Lau writing in a note that TSMC “will capture a sizable share” of Intel business. That “could lead to TSMC raising its current long-term growth of 5-10%,” they said. “Such a structural shift in industry dynamics outweighs our previous concerns.”Taiwan’s stocks have proved resilient to both the pandemic and China-U.S. disputes this year. Local investors have also touted President Tsai Ing-wen’s efforts in containing the spread of the coronavirus, success that has kept the economy on track.

European stocks opened lower.The precious metal notched its biggest intraday increase since April while a gauge of the dollar sank to January 2019 levels. EasyJet Plc and Ryanair Holdings Plc led the Stoxx Europe 600 Index lower after the U.K.’s decision to quarantine travelers returning from Spain. Futures on the three main U.S. equity gauges rose modestly after the benchmarks all lost ground last week.Asia equities advanced, with a 10% surge in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. leading shares in Taipei toward a record high. Treasuries edged up.Investor concern about the global economy and expectations that the Fed’s open market committee meeting may reinforce a dovish outlook are driving the dollar and precious metals in opposite directions while supporting U.S. equities.

2020-07-27	2020-07-27 05:29:33	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Heavy Is the Head That Wears the Semiconductor Crown	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Just 10 days ago, I noted that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s earnings and outlook served as proof that it’s truly the global king of chips. Since then, the company has grown even stronger, but more good news also increases the burden and will likely draw far more attention than it’s comfortable with.Being bigger and more indispensable sounds like a great position to be in. Yet that could also irk competition regulators, clients and governments that, amid a tech cold war, worry that one company may have become too powerful.The way that TSMC brushed off the pending loss of orders from Huawei Technologies Co. to raise its spending plan for the year is what had recently impressed me. Then last week, Intel Corp. revealed that its next, most-advanced chips would again be delayed, sending the American company’s stock down 16%. As colleague Tae Kim noted, investors have seen this movie before. Intel has slipped up too many times in recent years, allowing rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to take market share, and spurring Apple Inc. to drop Intel processors in favor of designing its own.Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan’s statement that manufacturing the chips could be outsourced made it worse. Once the global leader in both design and production, Intel would be eliminating its biggest competitive advantage against AMD — whose chips are made by TSMC — in their tussle over processors used in laptops, PCs and servers. The power shift was confirmed Monday morning. TSMC jumped by its 10% daily limit in Taiwan to a record high after the Taipei-based Commercial Times newspaper reported that Intel has placed an order for its 6 nanometer chips for next year. Not only would this be an unprecedented development for both client and supplier, the reported size of the contract — 180,000 wafers — is almost as large as that for long-time client AMD (200,000 wafers), which raised its own order. As a result, according to the newspaper, the manufacturer’s leading-edge capacity is fully booked for the first half of next year. A report in Taipei’s Economic Daily News meanwhile says that Apple will set up a display R&D plant within TSMC. Recent advances are starting to merge flat-screen display and semiconductor technologies, and the chipmaker finds itself at the center of the action.These new developments are where the responsibilities of TSMC’s crown will begin to weigh. It has a long list of clients whose needs must be met. Beyond Apple and Intel, global leaders including Nvidia Corp., Qualcomm Inc., MediaTek Inc. and Broadcom Inc. all rely on TSMC to churn out chips for the planet’s electronics devices. Great, except that expanding takes years and billions of dollars. Overbuild and you’re left with idle capacity that’s quickly depreciating and burning a hole in your income statement.Another thing to keep in mind is that for all of Intel’s woes, TSMC isn’t perfect, either.In 2012, Qualcomm struggled to supply a new line of chips to its own clients, smartphone brands, because the Taiwanese company was having trouble delivering on time. That spurred a search for alternative suppliers. Two years ago, a malware attack and a separate incident involving poor chemical quality at TSMC both caused delays. By all accounts, clients forgave, but probably won’t forget.Then there are regulators. The company told investors in 2017 that it was under preliminary investigation by the European Commission “concerning alleged anti-competitive practices… in relation to semiconductor sales.” The implication was that TSMC — holding more than 50% of the global contract-manufacturing market — is too big and powerful, with reports at the time suggesting that the U.S. Fair Trade Commission was also taking a look. While it seems both probes are on hold, there’s every chance that either could be dusted off and restarted should concerns increase.The company has only grown bigger since, and become an unwilling player in the U.S.-China tech cold war. It has sought to ease concerns that so much American semiconductor prowess and supply sits offshore by announcing that it will build a factory in Arizona. Former Intel executive Peter Cleveland and U.S. Chamber of Commerce policy director Nicholas Montella have been hired to beef up its U.S. lobbying team. After decades behind the scenes, TSMC is taking an ever-bigger share of the spotlight as one of the most famous and powerful technology companies in the world. So far, it’s managed to outsmart competitors, skirt antitrust regulators, and survive early rounds of the Washington-Beijing chill. This may make it a hero to investors and the ruler of its sector, but also creates a huge target. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-07-25	2020-07-25 03:07:11	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel ‘Stunning Failure’ Heralds End of Era for U.S. Chip Sector	(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp.’s decision to consider outsourcing manufacturing heralds the end of an era in which the company, and the U.S., dominated the semiconductor industry. The move could reverberate well beyond Silicon Valley, influencing global trade and geopolitics.The Santa Clara, California-based company has been the largest chipmaker for most of the past 30 years by combining the best designs with cutting-edge factories, several of which are still based in the U.S.Most other U.S. chip companies shut or sold domestic plants years ago, and had other firms make the components, mostly in Asia. Intel held out, arguing that doing both improved each side of its operation and created better semiconductors. That strategy is in tatters now, with the company’s factories struggling to keep up with the latest 7-nanometer production process.After Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said Intel is considering outsourcing, the company’s shares slumped 16% on Friday, the most since March, when the stock market plummeted in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.“We view the roadmap missteps to be a stunning failure for a company once known for flawless execution, and could well represent the end of Intel’s computing dominance,” Chris Caso, an analyst at Raymond James, wrote in a research note on Friday.Swan says where a semiconductor is made isn’t that important. However, domestic chip production has become a national priority for China, and some U.S. politicians and national-security experts consider sending this technical knowhow overseas to be a potentially dangerous mistake.“We’ve seen how vulnerable we are,” John Cornyn, a top Senate Republican, said in June when U.S. lawmakers proposed an estimated $25 billion in funding and tax credits to strengthen domestic semiconductor production.Intel’s Xeon chips run computers and data centers that support the design of nuclear power stations, spacecraft and jets, while helping governments quickly understand intelligence and other crucial information.Many of these processors are made at facilities in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico. If Intel outsources this work, it would likely be done by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which focuses on production and is currently the world leader. It’s based in Hsinchu, one of the closest Taiwanese cities to China, which considers the Asian island a rogue province rather than an independent country.“With the latest push out of process technology, we believe that Intel has zero-to-no chance of catching or surpassing TSMC at least for the next half decade, if not ever,” Susquehanna analyst Chris Rolland wrote in a research note. He thinks Intel should sell its plants to TSMC, although he says that’s unlikely.Over the years, Intel has spent tens of billions of dollars updating its factories, and all of Swan’s predecessors touted them as a crucial advantage that kept the company ahead of the rest of the industry. As the largest chip producer, Intel benefited from economies of scale and attracted the most experienced engineers and scientists.The rise of smartphones and other mobile devices changed all that. Intel dabbled in mobile chips, but never committed its best production and design to the area, preferring to prioritize its existing PC and server chip businesses. When smartphone sales took off, phone makers used other processors from companies like Qualcomm Inc. or they designed their own, like Apple Inc. And TSMC factories churned these components out.While Intel makes hundreds of millions of chips a year now, TSMC produces more than a billion annually. That’s given the Taiwanese company more experience to improve its factories, helping TSMC’s engineers overtake their Intel counterparts in technical execution.Read more: Intel’s Chipmaking Throne Is Challenged by Taiwanese UpstartSwan said on Friday that Intel’s products are still the best, despite the manufacturing delays. But by opening the door to outsourcing, the CEO endangers one of the last bastions of U.S. technology leadership.“By outsourcing leading edge technology, presumably to TSMC, Intel would give up what has been its main source of competitive advantage for 50 years,” Caso of Raymond James said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stunning-failure-heralds-end-030711424.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-24	2020-07-24 21:01:43	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	5 Top Stock Trades for Monday: AMD, TSLA, NKLA, TSM, SAM	After gapping lower and selling off, the S&P 500 did a solid job of recouping some of its losses on Friday. With that in mind, let's look at a few top stock trades for next week, which will be busy with earnings.  Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comDoes this chart of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) look familiar? Well it should. I flagged the breakout in this name just the other day. Although, to be fair, I did not think a one-day gain of 16.5% was coming on Friday.The move has sent AMD through both the 123.6% and 138.2% extensions. And with earnings on Tuesday, shares may continue to rally into the print. After reporting, though, it would be impressive to see these extensions hold as support on any sort of pullback.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the upside, I want to see if shares can get to the 161.8% extension, up near $73. Above technically puts $75 and the two-times range extension in play over $80. If shares fill the gap near $62, however, then the $58 to $59 breakout level must hold as support should AMD fall that far.  * 10 Cybersecurity Stocks We Need Now More Than Ever Remember, AMD reports earnings on July 28. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Tesla (TSLA)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comDespite beating on earnings and revenue expectations, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) coughed up all of its gains and reversed lower on Thursday. That selling pressure continued on Friday, as well. Shares are now below the 10-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line). However, the 20-day moving average is holding up as support. If this level fails, we could see a notable move lower. In that event, the first downside level of interest is $1,300, the most recent gap-up level. Below and shares could begin to fill a few gaps, the lowest of which is near $1,100 and the 50-day moving average. That would seem like a reasonable buying opportunity if the selloff is quick. On the upside, though, see if Tesla regains the 10-day moving average. Above puts $1,650 resistance back in play.  Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Nikola (NKLA)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comThe ride in Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) has been fun, but it may be over. Shares continue to violently roll over, Now down more than 60% from last month's high. For now, $30 is catching a bid. If it holds up as support, see if the stock can rebound to $42. Above that, and NKLA will face a key test vs. its moving averages and downtrend resistance (blue line).   * 7 Semiconductor Stocks Ready for Big Growth If $30 fails, it could usher in a decline to the $20 mark and the 200-day moving average.  Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAMD and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) are erupting higher on the recent product delay announcement from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which fell more than 16% on the news (and after reporting earnings).  In any regard, TSM gapped higher to new all-time highs, as shares burst over the 161.8% extension, but found resistance at the two-times range extension. On the plus side, we now have our trading range. On the downside, bulls do not want to see TSM lose the 161.8% extension and the $70 mark. If it does, the stock could go on to fill the gap into the upper-$60s. On the upside, though, a move above the two-times range extension could trigger more upside, and potentially put the 261.8% extension in play up near $88. That would likely be a longer-term target.  Top Trades for Monday No. 5: Boston Beer (SAM)  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comHello Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM). The stock looks more like a popping champagne bottle on Friday as the stock erupted more than 25%, and that's just what some traders are doing if they've been long this name. SAM stock has been on fire, more than doubling from the lows ahead of Friday's move. It has now almost tripled from the March low. Like TSM stock, though, we now have a nice trading range to watch. On the upside, see if Boston Beer can push through the 361.8% extension. If it can, it puts the four-times range extension in play up at $864. On the downside, should shares fall below the three-times range extension near $720, SAM may finally need a rest. It could put uptrend support (blue line) in play, as well as a possible gap-fill down to $675. Look for an eventual retest of the 20-day moving average at some point, too.I would think some traders are, at the very least, trimming a bit into this move.

On Friday, AMD shares closed up 16.5% at a record $69.40, while Intel shares finished down 16.2% at $50.59. AMD shares closed at a higher price than Intel's for the first time ever on Wednesday, by 74 cents, only to fall back below Intel's price on Thursday, but Friday's close firmly widened that gap in AMD's favor. Late Thursday, Intel said it may have to reach out to third-party manufacturers to produce 7-nm chips, which AMD already sells, because of a &quot;defect mode,&quot; pushing a possible release out to late 2022 or early 2023. Additionally, U.S. traded shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , which manufacturers chips for AMD and other chip designers, surged 9.7% to close at $73.90. Several chip-sector analysts issued downgrades and price target cuts to Intel, while conceding that AMD had the most to gain from Intel's woes.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/44020cb6-f59d-3aa2-b8af-3da8a10985c4/amd-stock-price-closes-above.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-24	2020-07-24 14:21:12	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Plunges as It Weighs Exit From Manufacturing Chips	(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan spent almost an hour on Thursday discussing an idea that would once have been unthinkable for the world’s largest semiconductor company: Not manufacturing its own chips. Intel’s shares tumbled as much as 18% Friday morning.Outsourcing is the norm in the $400 billion industry nowadays, but for 50 years Intel has combined chip design with in-house production. And until recently, Intel was even planning to churn out processors for others.“To the extent that we need to use somebody else’s process technology and we call those contingency plans, we will be prepared to do that,” Swan told analysts on a conference call, after the company warned of another delayed production process. “That gives us much more optionality and flexibility. So in the event there is a process slip, we can try something rather than make it all ourselves.”Pursuing this option would represent a huge shift in the industry and the end of Intel’s biggest differentiator, Cowen & Co. analyst Matt Ramsay said.Design can only do so much for semiconductor performance. The manufacturing step is crucial to ensuring these components can store more data, process information faster and use less energy. Combining the two helped Intel improve both sides of its operation for decades.However, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has succeeded by just focusing on production and leaving the design to other companies. Its factories have passed Intel in capabilities. And that’s helped Intel rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. catch up on performance. AMD shares rose 11% Friday.Read more: Intel’s Chipmaking Throne Is Challenged by Taiwanese UpstartIntel’s current best technology, known as 10 nanometer in the industry, was scheduled to appear in 2017 and is only now making it into high-volume production. And when the company reported results on Thursday, it said the next iteration -- 7 nanometer -- would be delayed by a year.“You didn’t need to read any more,” Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “Whatever little credibility they had is out of the window.”That sent Intel shares tumbling and left Swan fending off a barrage of questions from frustrated analysts on the conference call. They all asked about the manufacturing delay, its financial consequences and what Intel plans to do. The shares fell the most in four months Friday in New York to a low of $49.50.Swan’s answers were sometimes disjointed and vague. “What’s different is we’re going to be pretty pragmatic about --- yes if, and if and when we should be making a step inside or making it outside and making sure that we have optionality to -- yeah build internally mix and match inside and outside or go outside in its entirety,” he said at one point.Intel’s back-up plan means it may tap TSMC to make its chips. But that won’t be easy, according to Cowen’s Ramsay. TSMC’s other customers, who compete with Intel, would likely oppose the Taiwanese company prioritizing Intel’s designs, he said.And TSMC would probably be reluctant to build lots of new production capacity for Intel when there’s a chance the U.S. company may switch back to its own factories later.“They can’t go to TSMC because it doesn’t have the capacity,” Bernstein’s Rasgon said.Swan, a former CFO who took the CEO role only after reversing a decision to exclude himself from consideration, will have to make some tough decisions soon. His predecessors lauded Intel’s factories and spent billions of dollars a year keeping up with the latest manufacturing technology. Outsourcing that to another company may mean Intel never catches up again.Swan tried to put a positive spin on the challenge when he wrapped up the conference call.The flexibility is “not a sign of weakness,” he said.(Updates with AMD shares in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-considers-once-heresy-not-013625863.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-24	2020-07-24 12:40:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel faces massive Wall Street backlash on next-gen chip delay	Intel Corp.  faced massive Wall Street fallout Friday after the chip giant divulged in an earnings call that its next generation of chips would be delayed and that it may seek a third-party manufacturer to make them. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon downgraded Intel to underperform from market perform after what he called the worst Intel earnings call in the 45 he has covered in that it brought &quot;the structural issues we have been talking about for years directly to the forefront.&quot; Late Thursday, Intel said it was delaying its 7-nanometer line of chips by at least six months and that it may have to resort to an unheard-of contingency plan of having a another fabricator make them. &quot;From here we see things growing increasingly painful as 7nm delays are likely to overshadow anything good they can put forth, while magnifying any negative events, all while they fight an existential conflict with themselves as they attempt to figure a way out of the hole they have dug,&quot; Rasgon said. Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore also downgraded Intel, in this case to a hold from a buy, since the delay &quot;will foster fears of competitive pressures persisting, if not accelerating over the next 2-3 years and thereby cap the valuation on its shares.&quot; Of the 41 analysts who cover Intel, 12 have overweight or buy ratings, 20 have hold ratings, and nine have sell ratings, after three other analysts downgraded Intel, according to FactSet data. At least 16 analysts cut their price target on the stock, resulting in an average target price of $59.55, down from a previous $64.82, according to FactSet. Intel shares plummeted in premarket activity, falling 13%, while shares of smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , which already sells 7-nm chips, rose 6%. American depositary receipts of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , which makes AMD's chips, also rose premarket with a 4% gain.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/468d39ff-5498-3785-b0f4-792f96cdc301/intel-faces-massive-wall.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-24	2020-07-24 00:52:37	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Slumps After Chip Production Process Delayed Again	(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. shares slumped after warning about another production delay, sparking concern the world’s largest chipmaker will fall further behind rivals in a crucial area it once dominated.At issue is a new method for cranking out smaller, more powerful chips, the timing of which “is shifting approximately six months relative to prior expectations,” the company said as it reported quarterly results on Thursday.Intel shares fell 10% in extended trading. Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a rival, jumped 7%.Intel’s first 7-nanometer chips will go on sale at the end of 2022 or early 2023, Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said on a conference call. That’s a year behind schedule. AMD is already selling 7-nanometer-based processors.Competitive pressure has been building on Intel in recent years. The company designs and manufacturers its own processors, while many rivals focus on design and tap Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to make their chips. That’s helped TSMC improve production faster than Intel, and given companies such as AMD a new chance to compete.Read more: AMD Says New Server Chip Faster Than Pricier Intel OfferingMajor Intel customers, including Amazon.com Inc., are also increasingly supplying themselves with server chips manufactured by TSMC.Swan, the Intel CEO, said he will be flexible about outsourcing production. That’s a big change from the in-house manufacturing approach the company has used for decades.New production techniques in the chip industry are measured by nanometers. The advancements help companies make semiconductors that have smaller circuits on them. This allows the components to count faster, store more information or use less electricity. It also makes them cheaper to produce.Intel suffered delays in 2018 on its 10-nanometer initiative, too. The company’s comments on Thursday reveal that the new 7-nanometer production process isn’t good enough because it is creating too many chips that must be thrown away. Semiconductor companies need to have a high yield, or percentage of usable chips from each production run, to support new manufacturing plants that cost more than $5 billion to build and must be run 24 hours a day.A high-end server chip can sell for $10,000. It doesn’t cost that much to make but if companies throw away a lot of these components at the production stage, that cuts into profitability.For now, the production woes have damaged Intel’s reputation rather than it’s finances. Second-quarter revenue jumped 20% to $19.7 billion from a year earlier. Net income was $1.19 a share. Both topped analysts’ estimates.Chief Financial Officer George Davis said Intel will gain market share in personal computer chips in 2020 and end the year with a larger slice of the server chip business than it projected.(Updates CFO comments in final paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-slumps-chip-production-process-201451196.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-23	2020-07-23 23:20:49	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Just Gave Investors Even More Reason to Worry	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Intel Corp. investors could have used some upbeat news. They didn’t get it.A month after Apple Inc. announced a plan to switch to its own chips over Intel’s for its Mac PCs and laptops, and just weeks removed from the stunning departure of its top chip architect, Intel has now revealed even more disappointing news: another chip delay.On Thursday, Intel posted better-than-expected second-quarter results, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 while generating $19.7 billion of revenue in the quarter versus the $18.5 billion estimate. Sales guidance for the current quarter and the full year were also both higher than the average analyst forecasts.While the near-term financial numbers were strong, the big story was Intel saying its future lineup of 7-nanometer chips — a new version of the central processing units it makes that serve as the general-purpose operating brains for desktop and server computers  — will be delayed. The company said its CPU chips based on this manufacturing node will be released about six months later than its previous expectations, primarily due to problems with chip yields. On the call, Intel management said the first 7-nanometer desktop CPU is now expected to ship in late 2022. The stock tanked in after-market trading.Intel investors have seen this movie before. The company suffered years of delays in bringing its current 10-nanometer chips to market, which allowed Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to surpass Intel in its semiconductor-making abilities. This in turn enabled Intel’s main competitor, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. — which designs its own semiconductors and pays TSMC to make them — to take market share by offering better-performing and lower-energy consuming chips. Intel’s latest chip will likely prolong that shift in market share. Last month, I wrote about how Apple’s decision to use its own chips may pose a long-term threat to Intel’s server processor lineup. But more importantly, I said the departure of leading chip architect Jim Keller was even more worrisome for Intel’s future because the company needed an experienced hand to guide the final stages of development for its future designs. While we don’t know what exactly led to the 7-nanometer delay, it looks like the worst fears over Intel’s pipeline is now realized. What now? There is one dramatic move Intel can make to right this ship. For all its troubles, the main problem hasn’t been Intel’s ability to design good processors, but in manufacturing them. It ought to follow what the hottest chip companies like AMD and Nvidia Corp. have done, and outsource its manufacturing to the best chip foundry in the world: TSMC. It’s a simple solution that would help get Intel back on track.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-07-19	2020-07-19 22:00:50	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Tech's June Jump May Lead to December Disappointment	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- I wrote about a set of data in late May that portended a rebound in the tech sector. Now, I think some pain may ensue.Specifically, I drew on Taiwan monthly sales, which listed companies are required to report. This information is unique because it’s one of the few sets of data globally that gives visibility into the sector before quarterly numbers are released. The figures pointed to a revenue bounce, which occurred last month.These same data for June showed that semiconductor makers posted an aggregate 27% rise in sales from the previous year, while the category of electronics products distribution climbed an aggregate 10.7%. Companies in electric machinery, electrical and cable, optoelectronics, and computer and peripherals all posted their best month this year.But the data also suggest we’ve experienced more of a June Jump than a sustained recovery. Further, it appears limited to only a slice of the hardware sector — chips and PC products.A category of Taiwan corporate sales data called other electronics — which includes Foxconn’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. — is still down 3.4% for the year. Furthermore, that grouping has recorded only two positive months out of six — April and May. June data were as bad as March, when Covid-19 really sent the global economy into a tailspin. There are a number of caveats to the corporate sales data and the analysis that results from it, namely that they cover only Taiwan and are specifically related to hardware. Still, the outsize depth and breadth of Taiwanese companies in the global supply chain allows us to track trends. According to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the largest contract chip manufacturer, demand for its products is being driven by 5G networks and smartphones, plus high-performance computing, such as artificial intelligence and graphics chips.Digging into the computer and peripherals category, we can see more clearly what’s going on.This subset is dominated by Quanta Computer Inc. and Compal Electronics Inc. — the world’s two largest laptop makers. Yet bigger contributions to growth come from lesser names like Gigabyte Technology Co. and Micro-Star International Co., which make motherboards — those green platters of plastic to which components are soldered.  High-end gaming laptops and corporate servers are major uses of the motherboards produced by these companies — which gel with the demand for graphics and AI chips being churned out by TSMC. These niches are enjoying a resurgence thanks to the stay-at-home trend driven by the pandemic.We can see that outside of these specific product categories, the bigger drivers of demand, such as smartphones, still look weak. Upticks in March and June indicate a post-lockdown resumption of supply, and a burst in orders as the world settles in for sustained impact from Covid-19.The broader rollout of new telecom networks, which happens every eight to 10 years, helps offset this global weakness but doesn’t remove it. That means that it’s a dangerous bet to believe in wholesale resumption of demand, because macro-economic headwinds are likely to catch up with this short-term shot in the arm that tech has experienced.The “other electronics” category — a catchall for companies that make everything from smartphones and home electronics to modules and internet devices — remains weak. Lack of growth here, declining 6.9% year-to-date, points to a broader trend of tech companies suffering from the downturn and missing out on pandemic-specific demand. This is the sub-sector you’d want to see improve before declaring a recovery.For sure, that June Jump looks exciting. But investors should brace for disappointment over the coming six months.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-07-17	2020-07-17 01:55:37	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Singapore’s Hottest Stock Is Set to Continue Its Winning Streak	(Bloomberg) -- A top-performing Intel Corp. supplier in Singapore is set to continue its winning streak in the stock market as it benefits from emerging trends in the semiconductor industry.AEM Holdings Ltd. -- a chip-testing equipment provider that counts the U.S. tech giant as its main customer -- has surged 53% this year to become the top performer in the 107-member FTSE ST All-Share Index, the broadest measure for Singapore stocks. All four analysts covering the stock have an equivalent of a buy rating on it, and on average expect it to gain about 19% over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.This puts it in the running to be the best performer on the index for four of the past five years, as Intel further expands into data centers, autonomous vehicles and next-generation technology. And as pandemic-induced remote working arrangements become more commonplace, demand for chips is set to remain high. Gartner Inc. estimates the global semiconductor industry to log more than $400 billion in revenues this year, just down 0.9% from 2019.“We expect the share price to trend toward a new record high” with positive industry developments and data center demand, said Lee Keng Ling, an analyst at DBS Bank Ltd. She upgraded the stock to a buy rating in June. The firm currently has return-on-equity at more than 60%, in stark contrast to the median 9% of its peers, Bloomberg-compiled data show.Intel typically uses AEM’s machines for its chips for computers, laptops and servers, said Kenny Tan, an analyst at KGI Securities (Singapore) Pte. In March, Intel said that it is delivering more than 90% of its products on time despite the pandemic. That has supported AEM’s revenue guidance of between S$430 million ($309 million) and S$445 million for 2020 -- an all-time high.“More AI, more 5G applications, more telecommuting, more cloud services. Overall the macros look positive to us,” said AEM Chairman Loke Wai San in an interview. AEM’s shares rose as much as 3% in early trading Friday.Concentration risk, however, remains a concern for a company that relies on Intel for more than 90% of its revenue. The U.S. technology giant is facing its own set of troubles, with Apple Inc. planning to build in-house processors for Mac and competition increasing for chip technology from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.Intel Can’t Take Off Another Round in Chip Battle: Tim CulpanLooking ahead, the company is scanning markets globally for small acquisition targets that have annual sales of less than $10-$20 million. For now, “the majority of AEM’s market share gain will be tagged to Intel’s growth,” Tan said.(Adds share price performance in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/singapore-hottest-stock-set-continue-230000379.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-16	2020-07-16 08:53:59	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Chipmaker TSMC Raises Outlook in Sign of Tech’s Resilience	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. raised its outlook for 2020 revenue and spending, counting on global 5G smartphone and high-end computing demand to stay strong despite growing signs of a second coronavirus wave.Apple Inc.’s main iPhone chipmaker is now projecting more than 20% growth in sales, up markedly from an earlier forecast for a mid- to high-teens percentage rise. It expects to spend $16 billion to $17 billion on technology upgrades and expansion this year, up about $1 billion.TSMC, a bellwether for the industry because of its critical role in crafting silicon for everything from mobile devices to high-powered computers, raised both forecasts after June-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates by the widest margin in six years, surprising analysts who’d factored in a hit from the pandemic and U.S. curbs on No. 2 customer Huawei Technologies Co.Taiwan’s largest company is betting on 5G smartphone demand to take off during coronavirus lockdowns, when people treat their devices as lifelines to entertainment and essential needs. High performance computing or HPC will remain a growth driver given resilient demand for semiconductors in datacenters hosting that surge in online activity. It expects “the multiyear 5G and HPC application mega-trend to continue to drive demand for our advanced technology for several years,” Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said on a conference call.Read more: TSMC Shrugs off Huawei Ban and Shows Who’s King: Tim CulpanWhat Bloomberg Intelligence SaysSales of Asian contract chipmakers TSMC, SMIC and others may beat consensus in 2H despite the longer-than-expected Covid-19 pandemic, due to rising semiconductor demand for cloud processing and video conferencing amid social-distancing requirements.&#92;- Charles Shum, analystClick here for the research.Shares of the chipmaker fell 1.5% on Thursday in Taipei, after having surged to a record earlier this week. They are still up about 44% from their March lows. On Thursday, TSMC reported net income of NT$120.8 billion ($4.1 billion), exceeding the NT$110.6 billion analysts expected. That’s on previously reported revenue of roughly NT$311 billion.In the longer term, it will still have to contend with uncertainty surrounding Huawei, as the Trump administration’s ban on the use of American chipmaking gear for the Chinese company threatens a business relationship that accounts for about 14% of TSMC revenue.TSMC, the primary producer of cutting-edge chips for Huawei, hasn’t taken any new orders from the Chinese customer since mid-May. It doesn’t plan on shipping wafers to Huawei after Sept. 14, pending a final ruling from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, Chairman Mark Liu said Thursday. He acknowledged the company will face a short-term hit from the sanctions imposed on China’s largest tech company.But over time, other customers may step in to help fill the breach, said Jeff Pu, an analyst at GF Securities.“Apple is adding more orders for its upcoming phones, while MediaTek will also place more orders in the fourth quarter as Huawei tries to procure chips from them,” he said.TSMC executives also affirmed plans to build a plant in Arizona, saying that the U.S. administration and the state of Arizona closed the cost gap for building the fab. The company had previously said the $12 billion facility will begin construction in 2021, with production targeted to begin in 2024.Read more: TSMC Scores Subsidies and Picks Site for $12 Billion U.S. PlantFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-posts-biggest-profit-beat-055336571.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-16	2020-07-16 08:51:48	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC Shrugs off Huawei Ban and Shows Who's King	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. was expected to be severely hurt by a U.S. ban on producing chips designed by Huawei Technologies Co., one of its largest clients.The opposite seems true. The Taiwanese chip foundry posted earnings Thursday that far surpassed estimates, and went on to raise its revenue and spending guidance for this uniquely troubled year. Not only does Huawei make a large slice of the world’s telecommunications network equipment, it’s also a major international smartphone brand. To power a lot of that gear, it designs chips at its own HiSilicon unit that are manufactured by TSMC. But a May 15 edict from the U.S. Department of Commerce banning the use of American technology to make chips for Huawei has forced the Taiwanese company to stop taking orders from its Chinese client. Given that Huawei is the company’s second-largest customer behind Apple Inc., the move was widely expected to deliver a body blow to TSMC, especially in orders for its latest manufacturing technology.TSMC has barely flinched.The supply chain will adjust, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei told investors bluntly.In other words, the broader trends toward 5G mobile networks and smartphones, coupled with high-performance computing products (such as artificial intelligence and graphics) means that if end-customers don’t buy from Huawei, they'll find someone else. And that alternative supplier is going to turn to TSMC for chips.So far, it looks like Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB will replace Huawei in networks. In smartphones, brands from Xiaomi Corp. to Apple Inc. may benefit, while Huawei itself can ship devices using semiconductors from third-party designers like Qualcomm Inc. and MediaTek Inc.Asked how the Huawei ban would impact TSMC’s ability to fill up its multi-billion dollar factories, Chairman Mark Liu said that the company is progressing well in using any capacity left open. He’s putting his money where his mouth is. The company will now add another $1 billion for spending on new equipment in its 2020 plan, taking the budget as high as $17 billion.As if to prove the naysayers wrong, TSMC went one step further by raising its revenue forecast. In April, it expected sales would climb a “mid to high single digit percentage” this year. Now, the company reckons it will top 20% growth.It’s almost as if the Covid-19 pandemic and the Huawei ban had never happened. Companies are installing new servers, stay-at-home workers are buying computer monitors, and quarantined consumers are whiling away the hours on games consoles. What it comes down to is that in any scenario, electronics are being bought and semiconductors are running them.Inevitably, that means the world still needs TSMC.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-07-16	2020-07-16 07:17:28	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Top China Chipmaker SMIC More than Triples in Shanghai Debut	(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. surged more than 200% during its Shanghai debut following a stock offering that is set to be China’s largest in a decade.The Shanghai-based chipmaker climbed to 82.92 yuan on its first day of trading in the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s STAR market after initially selling shares at 27.46 yuan apiece. SMIC will raise as much as 53.2 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) if it fully exercises a greenshoe option, which would make it the largest mainland stock sale since Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.’s 68.5 billion yuan Shanghai initial public offering in 2010.SMIC’s mainland listing comes amid intensifying competition between the U.S. and China for global tech supremacy. As the country’s No.1 contract manufacturer of chipsets, SMIC plays an important role in Beijing’s ambitions of becoming self-sufficient in semiconductor production following efforts by the Trump administration to curtail access by Chinese companies to key components.Proceeds from the share sale will be used to develop next-generation chipmaking technologies as SMIC seeks to catch up to rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co.’s most advanced smartphone models. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, is ready to commercialize 5 nanometer technology, two generations ahead of SMIC’s capabilities.China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, Singapore’s sovereign fund GIC Pte and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are among institutional investors that participated in SMIC’s share offering.SMIC’s shares in Hong Kong fell 22% Thursday, the biggest drop since its listing in 2004. Those shares had tripled this year in anticipation of the Shanghai listing.“SMIC has surged multiple times over a short period of time,” Kenny Wen, strategist with Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co., said by phone. “We see investors rush to profit-taking once the listing is completed.”(Updates with Hong Kong trading in penultimate paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-china-chipmaker-smic-more-012644190.html?.tsrc=rss

That likely means TSMC’s revenue grew about 29% to NT$310.7 billion last quarter, based on previously reported figures, beating the NT$308.8 billion analysts expect on average.TSMC, a barometer for the industry thanks to its heft in the global supply chain, had previously lowered its 2020 revenue outlook to reflect potentially the biggest global economic crisis since the Great Depression. But it said at the time it still expects robust demand for the semiconductors in datacenters hosting an unprecedented surge in online activity during the pandemic. Executives forecast revenue growth of about 30% in the June quarter while sticking to a goal of $15 billion to $16 billion for capital spending in 2020, up from last year’s $14.9 billion.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysSales of Asian contract chipmakers TSMC, SMIC and others may beat consensus in 2H despite the longer-than-expected Covid-19 pandemic, due to rising semiconductor demand for cloud processing and video conferencing amid social-distancing requirements.&#92;- Charles Shum, analystClick here for the research.In the longer term, the chipmaker will still have to contend with uncertainty as Covid-19 spreads across the globe, particularly as signs emerge of a second wave.

2020-07-08	2020-07-08 22:00:30	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	China Tech Roller Coaster Is Just Starting Its Climb	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China is nothing if not ambitious. Facing a coronavirus-battered economy, Beijing is speeding up an infrastructure build-out to stimulate growth, vowing to spend an estimated $1.4 trillion over five years on areas such as 5G, industrial automation and cybersecurity.This enthusiasm has propelled a fast and furious surge in stocks. The tech-heavy ChiNext Index is up 46% this year, and sports an eye-popping valuation of 35 times 2021 earnings. That’s above the Nasdaq Composite Index’s 27.5 times, which is already expensive and reason enough for the rally to fade.Investors are smart to play in fields where the fiscal dollars are. But it’s also a dangerous game. What’s recurring income and what counts as extraordinary items? Once we remove government subsidies, the valuations of China’s tech darlings become even airier. Helicopter money can come in many forms. First and foremost, Beijing is a large client. Even before the coronavirus, the government was the biggest buyer of IT security, accounting for 27% of total spending last year, according to IDC. Meanwhile, the latest policies, which require stringent security reviews, clearly favor local providers. Investors have picked up on this theme: Shenzhen-based Sangfor Technologies Inc., with a 25% and 22% market share in China’s VPN and content security segments, has soared 89% this year to $12.6 billion in market value. There are also regular cash handouts that lubricate companies’ daily operations, and money for new industrial parks. Injecting capital outright, as well as fast-tracking public-markets financing, are also on the table. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China’s largest chip foundry and its best shot at catching up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., checks all of the boxes. Its Hong Kong-listed shares have risen more than 200%, amassing a market cap of $29 billion.Without the Beijing put, though, the income statements of many tech firms would look drastically different. At SMIC, government funding, which appears in “other operating income,” rose 87% to $293 million in 2019. A further $59 million in the first quarter exceeded the foundry’s $51 million bottom-line profit; in other words, without subsidies, SMIC would be in the red — and it wouldn’t even have a price-to-earnings ratio to look at. This phenomenon is pervasive. Of the 37 listed companies classified as “integrated circuit” industries, subsidies accounted for a whopping 15% of operating profit last year, on a market-cap weighted basis, Bloomberg Opinion analysis shows.The stand-outs are memory-chip maker Gigadevice Semiconductor (Beijing) Inc. and Unigroup Guoxin Microelectronics Co., which designs chips used in smart cards. A similar picture emerges for software companies, such as Yonyou Network Technology Co., which aims to become China’s Salesforce.com Inc., and Sangfor. All these stocks are big winners this year. While it’s great Beijing is tending its tech gardens right now, the question is whether and when it will pull the plug. Over the years, China’s electric vehicle sector has had an on-again, off-again relationship with subsidies, creating turbulence in stocks, as my colleague Anjani Trivedi has written. Will the government get tired of paying for an expensive tech build-out, too? Another aspect worth considering is that, unlike previous endeavors, this new infrastructure spree will rely more on local governments than national spending. Indeed, major areas including Beijing, Shanghai and Jiangsu province have been rolling out ambitious investment blueprints lately. But, pinched by the virus outbreak, they have no money. Their funding gap will reach as much as 11.5 trillion yuan ($1.64 trillion) this year, according to the Ministry of Finance. The southwestern city of Chongqing, for instance, saw its fiscal revenue tumble by 16.8% in the first four months this year. Still, it vowed to become a strategic investor in Tsinghua Unigroup Co., which has the very expensive goal of becoming China’s Samsung Electronics Co. Will Chongqing be able to deliver? Of course, extraordinary times call for extraordinary ways to look at stocks. Right now, investors have big grins on their faces when they do a word search for mentions of “government” in company filings. China’s tech carnival can’t go on forever, though. At some point, wary of the trillion-dollar bills, Beijing will want to slow down the money flow. By then, investors will be left holding stocks with lofty ambitions and peanut-sized earnings.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2020-07-08	2020-07-08 15:04:34	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Nvidia Valuation Soars Past Intel on Graphics Chip Boom	(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s market valuation topped Intel Corp.’s for the first time, powered by soaring demand for graphics chips in data centers and other fast-growing technology fields.Nvidia gained 2.4% on Wednesday, giving it a market value of more than $248 billion. Shares of the graphics chipmaker are up 72% so far this year as investors bet the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated a shift to cloud-based digital services that use its technology. Intel shares have fallen 2% in 2020.Nvidia was co-founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, who’s still running the company. At the time, it was one of about two dozen graphics chip companies. It’s now the only independent maker of these components, after all of its rivals have been bought, folded or become part of larger companies.Nvidia was more successful than its peers at developing chips that turn computer code into the realistic images computer gamers love. Under Huang, the company has pushed that technology into new markets, such as data center servers and artificial intelligence processing.In just five years, Nvidia’s data center business has grown from $300 million in annual revenue to almost $3 billion. The chipmaker has won orders to equip the giant computing factories owned by companies such as Facebook Inc. and Google by successfully arguing that graphics chips can handle AI workloads better than more standard processors.Nvidia is the only company to have made sizable inroads into a server chip market that Intel has mostly dominated. While Intel’s data center business still generates more than $20 billion in annual sales, Nvidia is growing much quicker.Investors have rewarded this fast expansion with a rich valuation. Since debuting on the Nasdaq in 1999, the stock has averaged an annual return of 33%. In the past five years, it has soared more than eightfold and trades at 75 times earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Intel shares trade at 12 times earnings.Nvidia is now the third-largest chipmaker by market capitalization, behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co.Intel is responding to Nvidia’s success by introducing similar graphics chips. The two companies are also targeting the market for processors that help run self-driving vehicles.Intel has weathered similar challenges before. In 2016, Qualcomm Inc.’s market value topped Intel’s as investors bet that smartphones would eclipse traditional computing in popularity. That happened, but Intel benefited indirectly through its server chips powering the cloud services relied on by handsets.Intel also lost the title of the world’s largest chipmaker by revenue to Samsung Electronics Co. in 2017. It regained the title a year later, thanks to its resilient server chip business.(Updates shares in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-valuation-soars-past-intel-150434511.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-06	2020-07-06 09:02:48	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Dear China, Enjoy This Bull Market. Love, Donald	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As a diplomatic tit-for-tat escalates between Washington and Beijing, millions of Chinese investors — defiant and patriotic — are once again engineering a fast and furious bull market on their home turf. The theme? Self-reliance.Two years ago, when the trade war first hit, China’s $8.5 trillion stock market sank into one of its deepest bear episodes, as worries about the economic damage of decoupling took root. This time, tension with the U.S. hasn't even made a dent. Rather, mainland shares are on fire. The benchmark CSI 300 Index has rallied 14% this year, to trade at a five-year high. The S&P 500 Index, by comparison, is still in the red. Daily trading volume has exceeded 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) for three consecutive trading days. The latest frenzy began right after Beijing imposed its national security law on Hong Kong, despite U.S. opposition. Now,  investors have renewed their faith that China is finally recognizing the importance of self-sufficiency. Bullish sell-side analysts are tossing around buzz words like national champions, import substitutes and capital market reforms; ultimately, these boil down the idea that turning inward is good for stocks. There are many examples. Consider Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., a chip foundry that counts Huawei Technologies Co. as its largest client. Rather than languishing as Huawei gets boxed out of U.S. technology, SMIC’s Hong Kong-listed shares are up over 200% this year.On the financing front, SMIC is behaving every bit like a national champion already. On May 15, the day Huawei got slapped with further sanctions, the state-owned China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, which held close to 20% of SMIC as of December 2019, said it would co-invest about $2.5 billion into one of its wafer plants. Meanwhile, securities regulators have fast-tracked the company’s plans to raise as much as $7.5 billion in Shanghai, the largest mainland initial public offering in a decade. Beijing is well aware that chip manufacturing is a capital-intensive business, and it must provide financial support as SMIC races to catch up on technology. In the industrial space, global supply-chain disruption is already benefiting Chinese players. For instance, Sany Heavy Industry Co., China’s largest excavator maker, has seen its domestic market share jump to 27% from 8% in 2010, at the expense of foreign brands, data provided by HSBC Holdings Plc show. No surprise, Sany’s stock is up 24% this year, while Caterpillar Inc., whose mainland market share shrank to 11% from 14% in 2016, is down 13.5%. Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co., a large manufacturer, tells a similar story. It’s up 55% this year. Washington’s  attempt to block mainland businesses’ access to U.S. money — from the delisting of Chinese American depositary receipts in New York, to forbidding federal pension funds from investing in mainland companies — is only forcing Beijing to speed up its capital markets reform. Regulators are already rewriting equity financing rules, including the launch of new registration-based IPOs, and opening new funding venues for young startups. As a result, we can expect China’s stock market to grow to 100% of its gross domestic product in the next five to 10 years, from 60% now, estimates CICC Research.When it comes to stock investing, China and the U.S. face the same set of problems. A slowing economy inevitably eats into corporate earnings growth, narrowing any justification for a further bull run.But President Donald Trump is giving China’s stock market a second wind. Huawei may prefer chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — after the U.S. sanctions, though, it may have no choice but hold its nose and buy domestic. Meanwhile, industry consolidation, which benefits domestic firms, is only accelerating now that Beijing is openly supporting its national champions. Trump is always looking at the stock market for validation. This time, he’s looking at the wrong one.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2020-07-06	2020-07-06 08:33:29	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Chipmaker SMIC Eyes China’s Biggest Share Sale in a Decade	(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. is preparing to raise as much as $7.5 billion via mainland China’s largest stock sale in a decade, a big cash infusion for a chipmaker Beijing’s counting on to reduce reliance on American technology.China’s top homegrown chipmaker could sell as much as 53.2 billion yuan of shares, according to a Sunday filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange. In May, analysts estimated a Shanghai listing could fetch somewhere in the $3 billion range. The offering would be the largest since Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.’s 68.5 billion yuan initial public offering in 2010. SMIC’s Hong Kong stock jumped 21% to a record Monday, racking up its biggest gain since 2009 after mainland bourses surged.China’s biggest contract manufacturer of chipsets represents a major piece of Beijing’s vision to create a self-reliant and world-class semiconductor industry, particularly as Washington tightens restrictions on sales of silicon and software to the nation. SMIC plans to use the stock-sale proceeds to develop next-generation chipmaking to try and compete with Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Like TSMC, SMIC is a so-called foundry that helps fabricate chips based on other companies’ designs, and could prove key to Huawei Technologies Co. if Washington follows through on threats to choke off its pivotal semiconductor business.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysSMIC benefits the most from China’s push for self sufficiency in semiconductor supply. Rising research expenses to develop next-generation production technology may be the biggest drag on profitability growth. Sales gains could be constrained by delays in acquiring fabrication tools from foreign manufacturers.&#92;- Charles Shum, analystClick here for the research.SMIC’s shares have more than tripled in Hong Kong since March’s bottom, while the Hang Seng Index is up just 21%, on bets that trade friction with the U.S. will force Beijing to focus more on homegrown tech and products that replace imports. China’s state-backed funds pumped $2.25 billion into a SMIC wafer plant in May.The effort comes at a time the Trump administration is threatening to deny domestic companies like SMIC or Huawei access to crucial components and circuitry. SMIC’s listing is also a boost for the STAR market, which has struggled to attract major technology companies since its launch last year.The initial institutional offer for the shares was 165 times oversubscribed. China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund will subscribe to 3.52 billion yuan of the offering as a strategic investor while Singapore’s sovereign fund, GIC Pte., will invest 3.32 billion yuan.(Updates with biggest gain since 2009 in the second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smic-seeks-raise-6-6-085809897.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-22	2020-06-22 19:32:43	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple-Made Computer Chips Coming to Mac, in Split From Intel	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. said it plans to sell Mac computers using processors designed in-house, signaling an end to its 15-year alliance with Intel Corp.The first Macs with the Apple-designed chips will debut by the end of the year, Tim Cook, the chief executive officer, said Monday at the company’s virtual conference for software makers. Apple is also working on models with Intel processors, Cook said.“When we make bold changes, it’s for one simple yet powerful reason: so we can make much better products,” Cook said. “The Mac is transitioning to our own Apple silicon.”The new chips will enable Apple to build computers with improved security and battery life, said Johny Srouji, Apple’s silicon chief. Developers will need to compile versions of their apps compatible with the new products for the software to run smoothly. However, Apple will provide a fall-back to make old apps run on the new system. Microsoft Corp. and Adobe Inc. have already begun updating Office and Photoshop, Apple said.Apple introduced an array of software enhancements to its products at the event Monday. It will make the most drastic changes to the iPhone home screen since the product’s release in 2007, bringing the software more in line with Google’s Android. Users will be able to place widgets that sit between the typical grid of apps, can be set to varying sizes and present information, such as the weather or a calendar, that updates throughout the day. The Apple Watch will get sleep tracking and hand-washing detection tools.The changes to the Mac are the most significant, though. Apple will release a major new version of the Mac operating system, called Big Sur, with support for the new chips. The design looks similar to the iPhone and iPad, with curved app icons, translucency, notification bubbles and the new widgets feature from iOS 14. The Messages and Maps apps will gain many of the features available in their mobile counterparts, and the Safari web browser will get a translation tool, changes to tabbed browsing and a customizable home page. Executives made a point of demonstrating how smoothly these apps run on Apple-designed chips.The partnership between Apple and Intel was formed in 2005, when Steve Jobs outlined a move away from PowerPC processors onstage at the same Apple event series for developers. Intel helped Apple catch up to Windows computers, some of which were more powerful at the time. In tandem, though, Apple was working on more energy-efficient chips for mobile devices based on Arm Ltd. designs and continues to use those to power the iPhone and iPad.In recent years, the speed and power efficiency of Apple’s mobile chips have rapidly increased, while the pace of improvement to Intel’s parts has slowed. This irked Apple executives, who pushed the company’s silicon unit to develop more powerful processors fit for the Mac, people familiar with the matter have said.The split from Intel has been a long time in the making. As far back as 2012, Apple was exploring a switch to its own chips, Bloomberg reported at the time. In 2018, Bloomberg reported that Apple would formally begin the transition away from Intel in 2020.In addition to ensuring legacy software runs well on the new Macs, a challenge for Apple will be to make processors speedy enough to replace Intel chips in its “pro” line of computers. Apple didn’t say Monday which models will get the new chips. Intel shares were about flat in intraday trading, while Apple’s stock was up 2% Monday, surpassing market-wide gains.Intel said in an emailed statement that it will continue to support Apple as a customer. Intel also boasted that its chips are the most advanced and offer the most open platform for software developers.The Mac is no longer the key revenue driver for Apple that it once was, but it safely sells about 20 million unit a year, delivering about $25 billion in revenue. The computers are also key for Apple to retain its professional market, which helps spur purchases of more popular devices like iPhones, AirPods and Apple Watches.For Intel, a break with Apple is more of a symbolic blow than a financial one. The entire Mac laptop lineup represents less than 5% of Intel’s annual revenue, according to an estimate by Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. The bigger concern is that Apple could embolden other computer makers to make similar moves, he said. “Now you have an actual PC that can run on something that’s not Intel.”Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, has shrugged off attempts to unseat its dominance of personal computing for decades. Its only direct rival today is Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which has produced newer processors that have begun to take share over the last two years. But AMD’s revenue is still less than 10% of that of Intel.Other efforts to break Intel’s lucrative grip on computer processors haven’t made much of a dent. Microsoft Corp. has a version of Windows that works with chips made by Qualcomm Inc. PC makers, including Microsoft itself, have made laptops based on that combination. Those products are praised for their battery life but haven’t grabbed significant market share. The Qualcomm processors are based on the Arm technology that Apple uses in its semiconductors.While Intel’s grip on the market is largely intact and its earnings continue to grow, analysts have seen signs of slippagge. Most of that stems from persistent delays in introducing new production techniques. Once the leader in the crucial means of making processors faster and more efficient, Intel now trails Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the producer of all Apple-designed chips.Those slip-ups may have accelerated Apple’s departure from Intel, said Matt Ramsay, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Apple is a technology leader partly because of its control over both the software and hardware and its willingness to replace suppliers when it spots a vulnerability or an advantage elsewhere. “Their reputation with suppliers is of being somewhat ruthless,” said Ramsay. “It looks like another consequence of Intel’s execution challenges.”(Updates with more details starting in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-made-computer-chips-coming-183145989.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-19	2020-06-19 09:20:17	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Ignore Bearish Narratives and Make a Move Into AMD stock	There is a lot of optimism in the market for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Institutional investors scooped up 1.3% of AMD stock in the last 13-F cycle amidst substantial market volatility. A large part of it is because of its aggressive product road map, robust financials and competitive positioning.Source: Joseph GTK / Shutterstock.com However, the bears are skeptical about AMD's performance in the upcoming quarters due to supply chain disruptions. They question the performance of its foundry partners in these uncertain economic conditions. Additionally, bearish narratives also cover the potential impact of the closure of brick-and-mortar stores across the world, hurting offline sales.The reality, though, is that the data does not support these bearish narratives and despite few hiccups, the second quarter will be in line with the analyst estimates. Let's take a look at some of the reasons why I have a bullish take on AMD.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Baseless Bearish NarrativesSource: Muslim FarooqueThe bears have gone off about the AMD's potential pitfalls in the upcoming quarter, mainly due to its foundry partners. It's true that the company is not vertically integrated and relies on different companies to provide many of its products, which include Gigabyte, Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI), ASRock, TUL and Taiwan Semiconductors (NYSE:TSM).Tracking the latest figures for revenue growth for these companies will provide valuable insight into the health of AMD's supply chain. The chart indicates that the majority of its partners have exhibited strong revenue growth in the past month. The only anomaly is TUL, which has struggled in generating sales for a long time.These companies assemble and sell AMD GPU's and also manufacture and sell consumer and enterprise products internationally. A lot of these companies are exclusive partners with AMD apart from TSM, which also works with its rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).  * 10 Robotics Stocks on the Technological Cutting Edge Though supply chain disruptions have impacted AMD and its partners, overall, the performance of these companies has been solid and essentially nullifies the arguments presented by the bears. Disappointing Recent PerformanceAMD fell short of analyst estimates in the first quarter, but overall its trend remains intact at this point. The company revenues totaled $1.79 billion in the first quarter, while net income was $162 million. Though revenues beat Wall Street analyst estimates, EPS came in lower than the projected 18 cents per share.Perhaps the most encouraging sign for the company is its gross margins, which hit an eight-year record 46% despite the lower sequential increase in sales. The numbers could be better, though, if the pandemic didn't force a lockdown across different parts of the world.AMD has revised its guidance for the year, pegging revenue estimates at 25-30% down from its original estimate of 28-30% for 2020. On the flip side, arch-rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has pulled its guidance for the year. Rosy FutureThe optimism surrounding the company is understandable for most industry insiders. AMD has benefited massively from the lockdown with the work-from-home and play-at-home trends. More people are using cloud services, which bolsters the demand for server chips. This is perhaps why sales of its Ryzen-powered notebooks have been on a tear off-late.The company has also recently released its Ryzen 4000 mobile processors, which will help AMD in unlocking the full potential from mobile chips in the coming months. AMD's computing and graphics segment revenues took a hit in the first quarter but are still up by an impressive 73% on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, AMD expected to see a substantial turnaround in the growth of its semi-custom chip revenue in the latter half of the year with the release of the upcoming next-generation video-game consoles. Both the Sony PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X, use AMD's Zen 2 CPU and a next-generation GPU architecture.Furthermore, AMD also acquired a lucrative contract to supply its EPYC processors and Radeon Instinct GPUs to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories El Capitan supercomputer in 2023. El Capitan is expected to be the fastest supercomputer in the world. Final Word on AMD StockAdvanced Micro Devices is in a strong position to finish 2020 on a high. Its strong partner sales dispel any bearish narratives about its supply chain disruptions. The fact that it has not withdrawn its guidance for the year, unlike some of its competitors, is an encouraging sign which will only benefit AMD stock price going forward.The stock price is currently in line with the mean estimates, but the significant volatility in the market could reduce consensus estimates. However, the reality is that with its upcoming launches in the pipeline, it will only push the stock at the higher end of the analyst estimates. Therefore, there is a significant upside to the stock and is definitely a great stock to own at this time.As of this writing, Muslim Farooque did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-06-17	2020-06-17 00:45:27	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Why Goldman Is Siding With China on This Huawei Play	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- From Seoul to Taipei, large-cap companies are treated with reverence, boasting almost uniform buy recommendations from brokerage analysts. But in Hong Kong, a Chinese semiconductor foundry, which has gained over $7 billion in market cap this year, is stirring up controversy and splitting Wall Street titans. I’m talking about Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., which counts Huawei Technologies Co. as its largest client. Of the 33 sell-side analysts tracked by Bloomberg, only 14 have a buy rating, with the rest an outright sell or hold, which in the analyst world amounts to a polite no. The negative sentiment is easy to justify. Shortly after May 15, when the U.S. placed further restrictions on Huawei, Credit Suisse Group AG promptly downgraded SMIC. The new rules require that any chip supplier using American technology get a license before selling to Huawei. So unless that’s granted, or this policy is withdrawn, foundries from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to SMIC will have to stop doing business with the tech giant, the bank noted. Last year, Huawei accounted for 19% of sales at SMIC, and 14% at TSMC. The Taiwanese company has already halted new orders from Huawei, according to some reports. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. disagrees. In a research note published this week, the bank reaffirmed its conviction, adding fuel to SMIC’s already meteoric run. The stock closed 11.9% higher Tuesday, bringing this year’s gain to a whopping 78.8%. SMIC has become expensive by all traditional metrics. It’s now trading at 53 times 2021 earnings, versus TSMC’s 17.7 times. It’s cheaper on a price-to-book basis, but its return-on-equity is only 4.6%, well below the very profitable TSMC’s 23.4%. So what does Goldman see in SMIC? China’s vast domestic demand. SMIC’s advanced-processing-nodes unit has the potential to mass produce at least three times as many smartphone chips as Huawei by 2025, the bank estimates. As long as SMIC gets some new business at home, U.S. sanctions on Huawei won’t move the needle.This is a seductive narrative. SMIC fits nicely into President Xi Jinping’s Made in China 2025 initiative, which aims to produce 70% of chips domestically, versus about 20% currently. Tsinghua Unigroup’s Unisoc, China’s second largest mobile chip designer after Huawei’s HiSilicon, could start using SMIC for mass production, Goldman mused. Both are backed by the state-owned China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, simply known as the Big Fund. As of 2019 year-end, the Big Fund owned close to 20% of SMIC. On the financing front, SMIC sure behaves like a national champion already. Last year, it received $293 million in government funding, an 87% jump from 2018; subsidies accounted for a quarter of its Ebitda. On May 15, the day Huawei got slapped with further sanctions, SMIC said the Big Fund and a Shanghai municipal fund would invest about $2.5 billion into one of its wafer plants. It’s also on a fast track to raise at least 20 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) on the mainland’s Nasdaq-style Star market. To be sure, the technology gap between SMIC and market leader TSMC will persist, which explains why the Taiwan rival is so much more profitable. But as long as SMIC is seen as a national champion — it’s China’s most advanced semiconductor foundry — cheap state money will keep rolling in and will help close the gap. The company’s return-on-equity could improve to 14% by 2025, says Goldman. Mainland investors are certainly big believers. Last week, they bought a net $148 million worth of SMIC stock, the most hotly sought company on the southbound trade of the Hong Kong Stock Connect. Buying remains brisk this week.Just like the rest of its economy, Hong Kong’s $4.8 trillion stock market is a busy battleground for cultural clashes, with U.S. fund managers’ dominance gradually giving way to aggressive mainland investors. While foreigners may see SMIC as collateral damage to Huawei’s sanctions; all the Chinese see is state support. This disconnect is being played out in analyst ratings. Goldman is just taking the Chinese view.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2020-06-15	2020-06-15 05:57:22	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Asia Electronics Sector Booms, Bucking Global Economic Slump	(Bloomberg) -- Global trade data in the Covid-19 era has been generally abysmal, but look a little closer and the electronics sector that fires Asia’s trade engines could be headed for a pretty good year.In South Korea, semiconductor exports rose in May and imports of equipment used in producing semiconductors surged 168%, trade ministry data show. Taiwan’s electronic-component exports, which include chips, grew 13.2% in May to $10.2 billion, even as total exports fell 2% from a year earlier.The electronics industry is holding up relatively well amid the pandemic as companies adopt new technologies -- including 5G equipment and automation tools -- that make it easier for employees to work remotely. A sustainable boost will depend on whether consumers return with similar vigor, and whether other factors such as U.S.-China tensions don’t interfere with digital demand and supply.“The tech industry seems to have decoupled from the overall economy somewhat, as the tech industry is still growing well” and has been “relatively immune to Covid-19,” Mark Liu, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., said at a shareholder meeting June 9.Read More: Little-Known Data Show Signs of a Tech Bounce: Tim CulpanTSMC, the main chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co., still plans to spend as much as $16 billion on capacity upgrades and technology this year, and expects revenue gains in the mid- to high-teens, Liu said. Covid-19 has helped drive some budding technologies related to remote work and education and social distancing, he added.TSMC shares have risen 25% since their lowest close for the year on March 19, less than the 30% gain in Taiwan’s benchmark Taiex stock index in that time. TSMC shares were down 2.2% as of 1:32 p.m. Monday, compared to a 0.98% drop in the Taiex.Amid generally awful export figures from the region, “the one bright spot is semiconductors,” said Trinh Nguyen, a senior economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. “A lot of this reflects the product cycle and also the global lockdown and suppression that favor the ‘digitalization’ of economic activities, driving demand for electronic goods like chips.”Budding TechnologiesFor economies like South Korea and Taiwan that rely on tech exports, “the upturn in demand for electronics has been a pillar of support amid the coronavirus pandemic,” said Lloyd Chan, an economist at Oxford Economics Ltd.“However, the improvement in the tech sector won’t be able to offset significant demand weakness in non-electronic exports,” he said, adding that even the surge in PC demand “could be a one-off,” attributable to the sudden shift to telecommuting during the pandemic.Still, it helps that some of Asia’s most tech-focused economies have had relative success in containing the virus: Taiwan has reported just seven virus deaths, South Korea flattened its curve fairly early and Singapore’s fatality rate is among the world’s lowest. That gives momentum to efforts to restart tech engines and get consumers used to new ways of doing business.“We’re seeing more countries pledging economic reforms, and there’s increased urgency for a stronger technology push to lead the economic recovery,” said Zhao Defa, an economist at Continuum Economics in Singapore. “Given that South Korea and Taiwan are the world’s main semiconductor producers, they will be beneficiaries.”Some of the boom is specific to the health crisis, amid a global scramble for medical equipment and demand for video-conferencing and other technologies as work and school shift more to people’s homes.China’s medical exports and shipments of high-tech electronics jumped in both April and May, for example, while Singapore’s pharmaceutical shipments surged 174% in April from a year earlier. Further gains may not be as pronounced.Consumer demand is still lagging, though. South Korean shipments of computer products jumped 83% in May, their eighth straight monthly gain, but sales of smartphones dropped 22% and consumer appliances fell 37%. Globally, smartphone shipments are expected to fall 11.9% this year -- their biggest annual drop ever, according to data from research firm IDC.While 5G, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence will all create demand for Taiwan’s exports, setbacks from Covid-19 and U.S.-China tech tensions could constrain that progress, Beatrice Tsai, director-general of the statistics department at Taiwan’s Ministry of Finance, said June 8.Still, analysts at Citigroup Inc. see a risk that U.S.-China tensions will weigh on chip demand. China’s buildup of chip inventories was intended partly to get ahead of a U.S. ban on Huawei set to take effect later this year.China’s export orders have taken a hit from lockdowns in the U.S. and key European markets, said Rajiv Biswas, APAC chief economist at IHS Markit. A second-half recovery in those economies, as well as Christmas orders, could drive a rebound in tech exports, he said.Governments have tried to stay focused on the long view, aiming to take advantage of the tech sector’s relative advantage in the pandemic by providing special support for electronics firms and new technologies. Singapore pledged S$500 million ($360 million) last month to help businesses in their digital transformations, including moving hawker center stalls to e-payments, and is spending another S$3.5 billion on information and communications technology to mitigate the virus outbreak.When the virus’s spread threatened Vietnam’s burgeoning tech industry, the government granted an exception to its otherwise strict lockdown measures: Samsung Electronics Co., which makes about half of its smartphones in factories near Hanoi and is one of Vietnam’s largest investors, was allowed to shuttle in more than 1,000 engineers from South Korea.“The recovery will be digital,” Anand Swaminathan, senior partner and head of McKinsey Digital in Asia, said in a June 9 interview.

2020-06-12	2020-06-12 14:38:45	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Loses a Chip Wizard at the Worst Possible Time	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- What was already a tough week for Intel Corp. got worse Thursday night: One of the chip giant’s most essential employees left the building.Intel announced top chip architect Jim Keller resigned effective immediately for personal reasons after only two years on the job. The company didn’t specify exactly why but added the executive would serve as a consultant for six months to help with the leadership transition.Keller’s departure is a big deal. No one else in the semiconductor industry has his pedigree of chip-engineering success over the last two decades. In the late 1990s, he designed Digital Equipment’s Alpha chip, which was the fastest in the world at the time. Then, after stints as lead chip architect at Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and PA Semi, he led the team at Apple Inc. that created the A4 and A5 mobile processors, which were instrumental to the success of the early iPhones. After Apple, he returned to AMD and helped design the Zen microarchitecture, laying the groundwork for the company’s turnaround. And prior to joining Intel in 2018, the executive was the head of Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot efforts.The surprising resignation came after other momentous news for Intel earlier this week. On Tuesday, Bloomberg News reported that Apple was on the verge of announcing plans to use its own chips over Intel’s in Macs starting next year. That day I wrote about how Apple’s move would have multiple negative ramifications for Intel’s chip business. But the Keller announcement may be even more worrisome for Intel’s long -term future.When Keller arrived at Intel, his reputation reassured investors that the chipmaker would improve upon its lackluster technology execution in recent years. The vertically integrated company, which manufactures and designs its own chips, had fallen behind on both fronts. First, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. surpassed Intel in its capabilities to manufacture chips at smaller, more advanced semiconductor processes. Second, AMD’s latest chip designs have proven to offer better performance, along with lower energy consumption, spurring the beginning of market-share losses for Intel. According to Mercury Research, AMD has wrested nearly 2 percentage points of desktop PC processor share from Intel over the last year.In another sign of the sea change in technical prowess, last month Nvidia Corp. decided to choose an AMD server processor for its latest artificial intelligence computer. It marked the first time Nvidia didn’t choose Intel for its AI system, and it is especially noteworthy because AMD is Nvidia’s primary competitor in the graphics semiconductor space. Nvidia said it went with AMD because of its better performance.The next few years will be critical as chipmakers jockey for position in dynamic markets from cloud computing to AI, autonomous cars to visual graphics computing. With Intel’s current lineup falling behind, Keller’s resignation couldn’t come at a worse time.Industry analysts say it takes about four years for a chip architect to truly make its mark on a product pipeline. That makes Keller’s short tenure particularly problematic. Intel needed his experienced hand to guide the final stages of development for its next generation of chips. It simply can’t afford to lose him now.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-06-12	2020-06-12 14:28:09	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Engineers Found Guilty of Stealing Micron Secrets for China	(Bloomberg) -- A Taiwanese court ruled Friday that current and former engineers from United Microelectronics Corp. stole trade secrets from U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc. and shared them with a government-backed mainland Chinese company, closing one chapter of a global dispute that’s stoked U.S.-Chinese tensions.The district court of Taichung fined UMC NT$100 million ($3.4 million) after finding three engineers guilty of theft or assisting in the alleged theft. The trio was jailed for periods ranging from 4.5 to 6.5 years and fined between NT$4 million and NT$6 million.The case is part of a years-long dispute spanning two continents that’s deepened divisions between Beijing and Washington. Intellectual property theft is among the Trump administration’s chief complaints as it wages a campaign to contain China that’s rattled global markets. China, which is trying to become a major player in semiconductors, has repeatedly denied that its companies poach trade secrets.UMC said it will appeal the ruling, saying it has mechanisms to protect its customers’ intellectual property rights and it did not violate trade secrets laws. “In its appeal against the ruling and the excessively disproportionate penalty, UMC will cite many irregularities in both the investigation and the case itself,” the Taiwanese company said in a statement.Micron welcomed the verdict in a statement and said justice had been served. “The misappropriation of trade secrets and their transfer outside of Taiwan is detrimental to the country’s entire semiconductor industry and threatens future competitiveness. This judgment further reinforces the importance of intellectual property protection in Taiwan, demonstrating that criminal misappropriation will be appropriately addressed,” the company said.Micron first sued UMC and its Chinese partner -- Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., which is said to have benefited -- in 2017 in the U.S. for stealing trade secrets, setting off the dispute between the top U.S. memory chipmaker and one of Asia’s largest manufacturers of made-to-order semiconductors. In January of the following year, UMC counter-sued in mainland China and that July, a Chinese court banned sales of some Micron chip sales in the country. In November 2018, UMC and Jinhua, along with the three individuals, were indicted in California, charged with conspiring to steal trade secrets from Micron.Friday’s decision coincides with growing scrutiny of the role that Taiwanese companies play as global leaders in chipmaking and electronics assembly. In May, the U.S. slapped a ban on the sale without approval of silicon made with American gear to Huawei Technologies Co., a move regarded as an attempt to prevent industry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. from supplying its top Chinese customer.“The U.S. is intensifying its scrutiny of Chinese investors and companies and it will not allow Taiwan to become a loophole,” said Carol Lin, a law professor at National Chiao Tung University, speaking before the verdict was announced. She said that Taiwan’s legal process for IP theft cases is long and there is no knowing when this UMC case will be finalized. “This actually may undermine foreign companies’ confidence in Taiwan,” said Lin.Taichung prosecutors had indicted UMC employees J.T. Ho and Kenny Wang in 2017 on charges of breaching Micron’s trade secrets. Both are former employees of the U.S. chipmaker. Ho and Wang replicated Micron’s DRAM data onto their own devices and used the material for their work at UMC including a partnership project with China’s Fujian Jinhua, prosecutors said in an indictment document reviewed by Bloomberg News.Wang is no longer with UMC, according to a company spokesman. A third UMC staffer, Rong Leh-tian, instructed Wang to incorporate Micron’s design information into UMC’s own, according to the indictment. The intent of that was to shorten chip development times the court said in Friday’s statement.In reaching its verdict, the court cited evidence including how Ho was on both UMC’s and Jinhua’s payroll at the same time and it was clear the allegedly stolen technology was intended for use in China.“J.T. Ho earned two salaries respectively from UMC and Jinhua, so it is very clear he intended to use [Micron data] on mainland China,” the court said in a statement. “Kenny Wang and Rong Leh-Tian both leaked Micron’s trade secrets to UMC for the use of UMC’s relevant business units ... and the final research was to be transferred to Jinhua for mass production, so they had the intention to use [Micron’s data] in mainland China.”Rong, a senior manager, instructed the other two defendants to wipe any Micron data on their computers before Taiwanese prosecutors raided their workstations, but investigators found a large volume of material from the U.S. company on the devices regardless, according to the court.The court said Ho had received some NT$5 million from both UMC and Jinhua, while Wang got NT$1.5 million and Rong NT$1.6 million from UMC.“The defendants’ conduct have led to Micron’s loss of advantage and competitiveness in the market of products connected to the leaked trade secrets and undermined Micron’s interests. This damage is difficult to remedy due to the leak,” the court said in a statement.(Updates with response from Micron in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/engineers-found-guilty-stealing-micron-142809629.html?.tsrc=rss

Apple Inc. is on the verge of using its own chips over Intel Corp.’s for its Mac computers.Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that Apple is preparing to announce as soon as this month that it will use its own processors in Macs starting next year.

2020-06-09	2020-06-09 15:23:23	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Huawei’s 5G Patents Means U.S. Will Pay Despite Trump Ban	(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. owns the most patents on next-generation 5G technology, ensuring the Chinese company will get paid despite Trump administration efforts to erase it from the supply chain, according to a new study.The study by two research firms identified the inventions most closely connected to the 5G standards and found that six companies owned more than 80% -- Huawei, Samsung Electronics Co., LG Electronics Inc., Nokia Oyj, Ericsson AB and Qualcomm Inc., the only U.S.-based company in the group.That may be awkward for President Donald Trump, whose administration has launched a global effort to shut out Huawei, accusing the Chinese company of being a security threat. The administration has launched a number of salvos, including a ban on the sale of any silicon made with U.S. know-how, which is hurting the Chinese company’s aspirations to grow in cutting-edge fields.“Even if they hire some other company to build the 5G infrastructure, they still have to pay the Chinese company because of the intellectual contribution to develop the technology,” said Deepak Syal, director of GreyB Services Pte., a technology research firm that conducted the study with software firm Amplified AI Inc.Identifying how many patents a company holds -- and how key they are to the industry standards -- will help determine who profits most from the next generation of technology that promises to revolutionize developments such as autonomous cars, robotic surgery, and connected homes.The administration’s efforts against Huawei have borne fruit. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Huawei, is planning a plant in Arizona to allay national security concerns and shift high-tech manufacturing to America. In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson is taking steps to exclude Huawei from its fifth-generation mobile networks by lining up potential replacements.Industry standards are critical to ensure devices work together and communicate with each other, even across national boundaries. Tech companies get together to establish those standards and pledge that any relevant patents will be licensed on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms.There have been global patent wars for years over how to define those fair terms and who’s entitled to how much money in royalties. They were at the heart of since-settled fights, including Apple’s scorched-earth battle with Qualcomm, and Huawei’s dispute with Samsung. Huawei has also stopped paying Qualcomm what may amount to billions in royalties amid a dispute.The GreyB and Amplified study looked at about 6,400 inventions declared “essential” to 5G by their owners that had active patents somewhere in the world as of Dec. 31, 2019. By comparing the wording of the patent to the standard, the team of 25 researchers deemed 1,658 to be patents “core” to 5G.Courts and negotiators will ultimately have to decide, though, if the patents really are essential to the standard, whether they’re valid or not, and how much they are worth.Based on the study, all of the companies were found to be padding their patent submissions to ensure they would be able to enforce their rights later, and in an effort to increase the amount they’d be able to collect in royalties.“Companies over-declare pretty equally, so reducing everyone’s share by 75% or so yields the same pecking order,” said Jorge Contreras, a law professor at the University of Utah who’s written about determining what is “essential” to a standard.Huawei has collected more than $1.4 billion in licensing revenue and has paid some $6 billion to other companies, it said in a court filing in its patent dispute with Verizon Communications Inc.“Huawei creates plenty of its own intellectual property; we don’t need to steal anyone else’s,” Ben Howes, a Huawei spokesman, said in an opinion video. The company said it put together the video “in response to the U.S. government’s attempts to prevent Huawei from collaborating with academic institutions and innovating with our R&D and patents.”First-Phase StudyThe GreyB and Amplified study, considered the first phase as more patents are analyzed and the standards continue to evolve, showed the interconnectedness between companies around the world, Syal said. He said the purpose of the study was “to bring more clarity” to where the discussions or decisions are being made.“Rather than saying who has less contributions or who has less number of patents, let’s work toward increasing the intellectual contribution of our country or our company and then build the 5G infrastructure,” he said. “Otherwise, even by blocking, they are not helping in the end because they’re paying money in terms of royalties.”As part of the Trump administration’s efforts against Huawei, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo last week said European countries “need to get it out of their system. They need to use Western technologies.”While the administration has helped curtail Huawei’s growth outside China, it remains a player because of its global footprint and advanced technology.“From a pure technology standpoint, nationalism just doesn’t work anymore,” said Contreras.(Updates with U.K. plans and Taiwan Semiconductor plant proposal in sixth paragraph.

2020-06-09	2020-06-09 13:58:50	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Plans to Announce Move to Its Own Mac Chips at WWDC	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is preparing to announce a shift to its own main processors in Mac computers, replacing chips from Intel Corp., as early as this month at its annual developer conference, according to people familiar with the plans.The company is holding WWDC the week of June 22. Unveiling the initiative, codenamed Kalamata, at the event would give outside developers time to adjust before new Macs roll out in 2021, the people said. Since the hardware transition is still months away, the timing of the announcement could change, they added, while asking not to be identified discussing private plans.The new processors will be based on the same technology used in Apple-designed iPhone and iPad chips. However, future Macs will still run the macOS operating system rather than the iOS software on mobile devices from the company. Bloomberg News reported on Apple’s effort to move away from Intel earlier this year, and in 2018. Apple shares were up less than 1% Tuesday while Intel was down less than 1%.Apple is using technology licensed from Arm Ltd., part of Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp. This architecture is different from the underlying technology in Intel chips, so developers will need time to optimize their software for the new components. Cupertino, California-based Apple and Santa Clara-based Intel declined to comment.This will be the first time in the 36-year history of the Mac that Apple-designed processors will power these machines. It has changed chips only two other times. In the early 1990s, Apple switched from Motorola processors to PowerPC. At WWDC in 2005, Steve Jobs announced a move from PowerPC to Intel, and Apple rolled out those first Intel-based Macs in January 2006. Like it did then, the company plans to eventually transition the entire Mac lineup to its Arm-based processors, including the priciest desktop computers, the people said.Read more: Apple Aims to Sell Macs With Its Own Chips Starting in 2021Apple has about 10% of the PC market, so the change may not cut into Intel sales much. However, Macs are considered premium products. So if the company moves away from Intel for performance reasons it may prompt other PC makers to look at different options, too. Microsoft Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. have already debuted laptops that run on Arm-based chips.Apple’s chip-development group, led by Johny Srouji, decided to make the switch after Intel’s annual chip performance gains slowed. Apple engineers worried that sticking to Intel’s road map would delay or derail some future Macs, according to people familiar with the effort.Inside Apple, tests of new Macs with the Arm-based chips have shown sizable improvements over Intel-powered versions, specifically in graphics performance and apps using artificial intelligence, the people said. Apple’s processors are also more power-efficient than Intel’s, which may mean thinner and lighter Mac laptops in the future.Apple’s move would be a highlight of this year’s WWDC, which will be held online due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Because of the fluid nature of the global health crisis and its impact on Apple’s product development, the timing of the chip announcement could change.At the conference, Apple is also readying updates to its other operating systems -- iOS, iPadOS, tvOS and watchOS -- with changes to augmented-reality capabilities, deeper integration with outside apps and services, and improved Apple Watch fitness features. A big priority is improving the performance of its mobile software after last year’s release, iOS 13, suffered from several issues.The company is working on at least three of its own Mac processors, known as systems-on-a-chip, with the first based on the A14 processor in the next iPhone. In addition to the main central processing unit, there will be a graphics processing unit and a Neural Engine for handling machine learning, a popular and powerful type of AI, the people said. In the past, Apple has made chips for specific Mac functions, such as security.Read more about Apple’s upcoming Mac chips here.Intel has faced more competition as its lead in production technology -- a key way to improve semiconductor performance -- has slipped. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. makes processors for many of Intel’s rivals using a more advanced process.TSMC will build the new Mac processors using a 5-nanometer production technique -- the same approach as for the next iPhones and iPad Pros. Intel rivals Qualcomm Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. also use TSMC to make their chips.The Apple chip project has been in the works for several years and is considered one of the company’s most secretive efforts. In 2018, Apple successfully developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro’s processor for internal testing, giving the company confidence it could announce such a shift this year.(Updates shares in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-plans-announce-move-own-100000814.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-09	2020-06-09 06:08:45	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC Scores Subsidies and Picks Site for $12 Billion U.S. Plant	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has secured government subsidies for its envisioned $12 billion chip plant in Arizona, moving closer toward finalizing a facility designed to allay national security concerns and shift high-tech manufacturing to America.TSMC, the main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co., has picked a site for the future plant and both federal and state governments have agreed to help make up for the higher cost of fabricating semiconductors in the U.S., Chairman Mark Liu told reporters Tuesday. Negotiations continue over the specifics of those incentives, he said without elaborating or identifying the site’s location.The decision to situate a plant in Arizona came after White House officials warned about the threat inherent in having much of the world’s electronics made outside of the U.S. TSMC had negotiated a deal with the administration to create American jobs and produce sensitive components domestically for national security reasons. It announced the project just before Washington leveled new restrictions on the sale of chips to Huawei, seeking to contain one of TSMC’s largest customers.TSMC has set aside land adjacent to its selected plot and hopes to convince its own suppliers to set up operations in the vicinity over time, Liu added. They would join the likes of Intel Corp. and Micron Technologies Inc., which already operate facilities in the western state and have helped build a vibrant local semiconductor industry over the years. The scope of any eventual subsidies would require blessing from Congress, Liu added.“Subsidies will be a key factor in TSMC’s decision to set up a fab in the U.S.,” he said. “We are still talking to the U.S. government. Our request is that the state and federal governments together make up for the cost gap between the U.S. and Taiwan.”Read more: TSMC Plans $12 Billion U.S. Chip Plant in Victory for TrumpTSMC is embarking on its U.S. endeavor during one of the most turbulent years in memory, with the coronavirus pandemic depressing the global economy and smartphone demand that top clients Apple and Huawei depend on for growth. The company, which in April trimmed its 2020 sales outlook, also finds itself in the crossfire as the Trump administration ratchets up a campaign to contain China. Washington last month barred any chipmaker using American equipment from supplying the networking giant without U.S. approval, effectively blocking Huawei’s access to semiconductor manufacturing and dealing a blow to TSMC’s business.The Taiwanese chipmaker hopes to keep supplying Huawei but is confident other customers can replace any business lost because of tightening U.S. curbs on China’s largest tech company. TSMC is studying the latest restrictions and is hopeful the issue will get resolved over time, Liu told shareholders Tuesday. Liu declined to comment when asked whether TSMC had already ceased taking orders from the Chinese company.But Liu reaffirmed TSMC’s projections for 2020, saying it still planned to spend as much as $16 billion this year on capacity upgrades and technology, and foresees a mid- to high-teens percentage rise in 2020 revenue.Shareholders “can rest assured that we will resolve these new restrictions one by one. We will find a solution to continue to grow and secure more profits for our shareholders,” Liu said at Tuesday’s annual general meeting. “If there are no more HiSilicon orders, our other customers will want to fill the gap in our capacity, market share, or smartphone market share left by Huawei. How fast they can fill that gap depends.”Read more: Huawei Sees Dire Threat to Future From Latest Trump SalvoWashington’s curbs -- a more precise strike against Huawei because it targets its secretive and cutting-edge HiSilicon semiconductor division -- threaten to wreak havoc throughout the complex chip ecosystem that produces technology for consumers and companies globally.As the world’s largest and most advanced maker of chips for other companies, TSMC plays a crucial role in the production of devices from smartphones and laptops to servers running the internet. Huawei is TSMC’s largest customer after Apple and accounts for about 14% of the Taiwanese chipmaker’s sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Taiwanese firm may now have to cut off Huawei unless it gets waivers from the Commerce Department. But additional business from existing clients like Apple, Qualcomm Inc., MediaTek Inc. or Advanced Micro Devices Inc. could help offset a decline in orders.For TSMC, it’s growing ever more difficult to remain neutral amid the growing tensions between the U.S. and China. The company brands itself “everybody’s foundry,” effectively the Switzerland of the tech industry -- something executives reiterated on Tuesday. It supplies not just Chinese customers like Huawei but also the American military, while relying on U.S. producers of semiconductor-making equipment like Applied Materials Inc. and Lam Research Corp.“New restrictions can lead to a rebalancing among market players,” Liu told reporters. Huawei “will not be able to make smartphones in the future without semiconductors, and other smartphone brands will eat into its market share.”“We will still have a high market share after the rebalancing,” he added.Read more: U.S.-China Fight Over Chip Kingpin Rattles Tech IndustryFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-confident-replacing-huawei-orders-030246275.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-09	2020-06-09 01:51:29	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Can the U.S. End China’s Control of the Global Supply Chain?	(Bloomberg) -- The trade war amplified calls in the U.S. and elsewhere for reducing dependence on China for strategic goods. Now, the pandemic has politicians vowing to take action.The Trump administration has talked about bringing supply chains home from China, and even publicly floated the need for a group of friendly nations in Asia that could help produce essential goods. President Donald Trump last month even said the U.S. would “save $500 billion” if it cut off ties with China.But interviews with nearly a dozen government officials and analysts in the Asia-Pacific region show that any broader effort to restructure supply chains is little more than wishful thinking so far. While governments are pushing to win investments, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s planned state-of-the-art semiconductor factory in the U.S., it won’t be simple to dismantle an entrenched system when many companies are struggling to survive.More likely is that the virus will accelerate a change that was already driven by market forces as rising wages and costs in China over the past decade caused an exodus of lower-value manufacturing, much of it to Southeast Asia. That’s despite the desire from some in the Trump administration to start decoupling the world’s biggest economies as the U.S. and China spar over everything from the virus to 5G networks to Hong Kong.“The rhetoric meets the reality, which is that many firms have supply chains set up the way they do for very sensible reasons,” said Deborah Elms of the Asian Trade Centre, which has seen an increase of companies looking for advice on reorganizing to increase competitiveness. “Coming out of Covid, it’s going to be even harder to move supply chains because your cash flow is low, your staff are working from home or coming slowly back into the office, and the business climate has shifted.”While the world trade network mostly held up well amid rolling lockdowns as Covid-19 spread, the economic cost fueled calls among politicians for greater self-sufficiency and alternatives to China. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whose department announced an Economic Security Strategy last year, in April named Australia, New Zealand, Japan, India, and South Korea as countries that the U.S. has been talking to on supply chains.A key plank of the State Department’s new Economic Security Strategy is expanding and diversifying supply chains that protect “people in the free world,” according to Keith Krach, a State Department official who leads efforts to develop international policies related to economic growth.Krach said in April a so-called “Economic Prosperity Network” of like-minded allies would be built for critical products.‘China Plus One’Industries would include pharmaceuticals, medical devices, semiconductors, automotive, aerospace, textiles and chemicals, among others.But the idea right now appears to lack any firm foundation. The State Department doesn’t have jurisdiction over trade, and officials in other Asian countries said no formal talks were taking place. A person close to the administration said Krach is prone to pushing grand ideas publicly that haven’t yet become policy.Still, other governments are moving on their own to shift production away from China -- especially since the Covid disruptions. This includes Taiwan and Japan, which were among the biggest investors in China’s manufacturing capacity in the early days.“Many companies have already begun adopting a ‘China plus one’ manufacturing hub strategy since the U.S.-China trade war began in 2018, with Vietnam having been a clear beneficiary,” said Anwita Basu, head of Asia country risk research at Fitch Solutions. While the pandemic will give that another push, “shifts away from China will be slow as that country still boasts an annual manufacturing output that is so large that even a group of countries would struggle to absorb a fraction of it.”In 2019, Taiwanese officials encouraged the island’s firms to build a “non-red supply chain” outside of China, passing a law that promised rent assistance, cheap finance, tax breaks and simplified administration for investments in Taiwan. The move helped the island’s economy weather the trade war last year and led to more than NT$1 trillion ($33.5 billion) pledged or invested domestically, and more overseas.Japan recently started down the same path, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government budgeting about 220 billion yen ($2 billion) for companies shifting production back home and 23.5 billion yen for those seeking to move production to other countries.“Everyone agrees we really have to reconsider the sustainability of supply chains,” Hiroaki Nakanishi, chairman of Hitachi Ltd. and head of Japan’s biggest business lobby Keidanren, said on television last month. “It’s unrealistic to suddenly return all production to Japan. But if we are totally reliant on one specific country and they have a lockdown, there will be huge consequences.”South Korea has similar plans as part of its economic blueprint for the rest of the year, announced earlier this month. The government said it will provide tax incentives, ease investment-related regulations and expand financial support for companies that ‘u-turn.’ Yet, it hasn’t said how much money will be earmarked for the entire support program.For all that, China retains some key advantages. Last year 38% of Taiwan’s $11 billion of overseas investment still went to the mainland, as did 10% of Japan’s -- despite increased investments in Southeast Asia over the past few decades due to periodic bouts of anti-Japanese rioting in China.Young Liu, chairman of Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry, whose Foxconn unit manufactures iPhone in plants in China, said in mid-May that it’s difficult to move assembly of mobile devices to the U.S due to the sheer number of workers needed.“China remains unmatched as a manufacturing site given its numbers of skilled workers, deep supplier networks and the government’s credible public support for manufacturers and provision of reliable infrastructure,” wrote Gavekal Dragonomics analyst Dan Wang in a report in April.Even if companies find economic alternatives to Chinese factories, or bow to political pressure to increase production in their home markets, there’s another reason why production inside China continues to make sense: the vast and growing Chinese domestic market.Tesla, HoneywellTesla Inc. is now producing cars there for what is now the world’s largest auto market, and last month Chinese Premier Li Keqiang sent Honeywell International Inc. a letter welcoming its new investment in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus outbreak started. He and other Chinese officials have touted continued economic cooperation with the U.S. and vowed to implement a “phase one” trade deal with the U.S. reached in January.“The formation and development of global industrial and supply chains are determined by market forces and companies’ choices,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in March. “As such, it is unrealistic and insensible to try to sever them or even trumpet ‘shifting’ or ‘decoupling’ theories as they run counter to economic law.”For all the talk of dependence on China, the pandemic showed that other nations could quickly adapt to meet the need for critical supplies when China’s lockdown halted deliveries of protective clothing, ventilators and medical supplies. Vietnam rapidly ramped up production of face masks, exporting more than 415 million in four months, while the U.S. pushed automakers and other manufacturers to retool plants to make respirators and other critical supplies.Over the long term, however, there are questions of whether those models are sustainable -- and who will pay for new plants outside China.Waving a WandA May 14 executive order from Trump allows the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., America’s development bank for emerging markets, to partner with the Department of Defense in the U.S. to lend money to American companies looking to build out supply chains for critical goods such as ventilators and generic drugs.But with governments already having to fund trillions of dollars in bailout packages for existing businesses and companies going bust in droves, finding the extra capital to restructure global supply chains is a tall order. Andrew Hastie, an Australian lawmaker and chair of the nation’s security and intelligence committee, called in a recent essay for “time limited tax incentives” to build national self-reliance in key pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other critical goods.In the end, the biggest force diluting China’s position in the global supply chain will likely be the long, slow evolution of global trade, as companies see opportunities that arise from new markets, new technologies and changing patterns of wealth. Why would a firm “say to their staff and their shareholders we have opted for political reasons to change the way that we do things,” said Elms, whose organization helps governments formulate trade policy.“The numbers have to make sense,” she said. “The structure that you have is based on millions of individual company decisions.

2020-06-08	2020-06-08 05:53:46	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Huawei Employees See Dire Threat to Future From Latest Trump Salvo	(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration has fired multiple salvos against Huawei Technologies Co. since the start of a campaign to derail China’s technological ascendancy. The latest blow threatens to cripple the country’s tech champion.Huawei’s leafy campus in southern China has been engulfed in a state of emergency since the Commerce Department in May banned the sale of any silicon made with U.S. know-how -- striking at the heart of its semiconductor apparatus and aspirations in fields from artificial intelligence to mobile services. Its stockpiles of certain self-designed chips essential to telecom equipment will run out by early 2021, according to people familiar with the matter.Executives scurried between meetings in the days after the latest restrictions, according to one person who attended the discussions. But the company has so far failed to brainstorm a solution to the curbs, they added, asking not to be identified talking about private matters. While Huawei can buy off-the-shelf or commodity mobile chips from a third party like Samsung Electronics Co. or MediaTek Inc., it couldn’t possibly get enough and may have to make costly compromises on performance in basic products, they added.What Huawei’s brass fears is that Washington, after a year of Entity List sanctions that’ve failed to significantly curtail the company’s rapid growth, has finally figured out how to quash its ambitions. The latest curbs are the culmination of a concerted assault against China’s largest tech company that began years ago, when the White House tried to cut off the flow of American software and circuitry; lobbied allies from the U.K. to Australia to banish its network gear; even persuaded Canadian police to lock up the founder’s daughter. The latest measures however are a more surgical strike leveled at HiSilicon, the secretive division created 16 years ago to drive research into cutting-edge fields like AI inference chips. That unit surged in prominence precisely because it’s viewed as a savior in an era of American containment, and its silicon now matches rivals’ like Qualcomm Inc.’s and powers many of Huawei’s products: the Kirin for phones, Ascend for AI and Kunpeng for servers.Now that ambition is in doubt. Every chipmaker on the planet, from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to China’s own Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., needs gear from American outfits like Applied Materials Inc. to fabricate chipsets. Should Washington get serious about throttling that spigot, Huawei won’t be able to get any of the advanced silicon it designs into the real world -- stymieing efforts to craft its own processors for mobile devices and radio frequency chips for 5G base stations, to name just two of the most vital in-house components. Dubbed the Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule or DPR, Trump’s latest constraints have implications for China’s 5G rollout, for which Huawei is by far the dominant purveyor.The ban “focuses on HiSilicon-designed chips, which present the biggest threat to the U.S.,” Jefferies analyst Edison Lee wrote in late May. “The DPR could quash HiSilicon and then Huawei’s ability to make 5G network gears.”Read more: U.S.-China Fight Over Chip Kingpin Rattles Tech IndustryThe scene at Huawei’s Shenzhen nerve center invokes deja vu from a year ago, when Huawei billionaire Ren Zhengfei emerged from seclusion to declare his company’s survival in doubt. In the months following that proclamation, two things happened. U.S. companies, spooked by the prospect of losing billions, lobbied Washington for exceptions to the Entity List and suppliers from Intel Corp. to Micron Technology Inc. relocated assembly to increase foreign-produced components and continue supplying the Chinese company. Huawei employees -- spurred on by patriotism given perceptions the nation was under attack -- went to 24-hour days to design alternatives to American parts.The latest curbs could prove more effective because they remove Huawei’s chipmaker of choice from the equation. In theory, any chipmaker can petition the Commerce department for approval to ship Huawei-designed semiconductors, and opinion is divided on both sides of the Pacific as to how far the agency will allow shipments to proceed. But if it chooses to enforce the new curbs to the hilt, HiSilicon can no longer take its designs to TSMC or any foreign contract manufacturer. And local peers such as SMIC typically operate two generations behind TSMC.In fact, the latest curbs could severely disrupt production of some of the more critical and visible products in Huawei’s portfolio, including the Kirin brains and communications chips of future 5G phones, AI learning chips for its cloud services and servers and the most basic kinds of chips for networking. In February, Huawei touted how its next-generation antenna chips have been installed in “the industry’s highest-performance” 5G base stations. It may no longer able to ship those base stations after the chip inventory runs out.“HiSilicon won’t be able to continue its innovation any further until it’s able to find alternatives through self-development and collaboration with local ones, which will take years to mature,” said Charlie Dai, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. “We estimate that Huawei’s inventory of high-end chips (including baseband chips and CPUs for Huawei’s high-end smartphones) may last 12 to 18 months maximum.”Read about how Trump’s blacklisting of Huawei failed to halt its growth.Modern chip manufacturing at the highest levels simply cannot happen without American gear from the likes of Applied Materials, KLA Corp. and Lam Research Corp. Even in basic wafer fabrication, replacing TSMC is impossible because the Taiwanese foundry is the only company able to reliably make semiconductors using 7 nanometer or smaller nodes -- a must for high performance. Moving everything in-house -- essentially building an American-free plant -- is a pipe dream because it requires extreme ultraviolet lithography machines from ASML Holding NV -- a prerequisite for next-generation chipmaking. Yet ASML’s machines also use American technology from the likes of suppliers such as II-VI Inc. and Lumentum Holdings Inc, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The best Chinese alternative could be Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment, but its EUVs are again a few generations behind the Dutch firm’s.All that’s even before factoring in the uncertainty over Huawei’s access to design software developed by Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc. The pair provide electronic design automation (EDA) tools that Hisilicon’s engineers rely on to draw up blueprints for next-generation processors. As Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Nonproliferation Christopher Ford told reporters in late May: “If one wants to be working in the area of the very best chips, the chips that have the most computing power packed into the smallest space, it is necessary to use U.S. design tools right now because we have a commanding comparative advantage in that area.”“While there will be lots of opportunity to continue selling lesser quality chips to Huawei, this will be an additional challenge for the really good stuff,” he added.How Huawei Landed at the Center of Global Tech Tussle: QuickTakeIn the long run, the lack of consistent in-house chip supplies will disrupt China’s grand ambition of challenging the U.S. for global tech supremacy. More immediately, they threaten to curtail China’s crucial $500 billion 5G rollout -- a key piece of Beijing’s longer-term strategic vision.Huawei stands at the center of Beijing’s $1.4 trillion New Infrastructure initiative to seize the lead in 5G-based technology. Now it’s uncertain if it can even fulfill the 90-plus contracts it’s won so far to build networks for local operators like China Mobile Ltd. and other carriers around the world. That’s because HiSilicon’s chips are essential in products waiting to be shipped out. The uncertainty of not just fulfilling contracts -- but also around Huawei’s very ability to maintain clients’ networks once they’re up and running -- may also spook potential future customers.Internally, executives remain hopeful of finding a workaround, and are repeating the same mantra of a year ago -- doing without American technology isn’t impossible. “The good news is we still have time,” said one person involved in Huawei’s supply chain management. Chip architecture and supply “redesign takes time, but not something that can’t be done.”(Updates with table of Huawei’s chipmaking options after the tenth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-troops-see-dire-threat-210000676.html?.tsrc=rss

The government said Thursday it aims to subsidize as much as half of all research and development costs incurred by global chip companies that build centers on the island.The endeavor escalates global competition for much-sought-after semiconductor technology and is intended to build on the island’s technology industry, led by major players such as key Apple Inc. suppliers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Taiwan has been caught in the middle of a clash between the U.S. and China over the development of chip technology that powers everything from smartphones to 5G base stations.Last month, the Trump administration barred any chipmaker using American equipment from supplying China’s Huawei Technologies Co. without approval, dealing a major blow to TSMC -- the world’s largest contract chipmaker -- and its peers.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has pledged to transform Taiwan into an R&D hub for emerging technologies. Her government is now pursuing more foreign tech investments from multinationals seeking to shift out of China over concerns about the intensifying U.S.-China trade war and their desire to reduce dependency on the world’s second-largest economy.The incentive program is mainly targeted at makers of memory chips, though part of it will also be used to attract global 5G and artificial intelligence technology companies.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-draws-plan-woo-1-043814756.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-28	2020-05-28 22:00:04	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Little-Known Data Show Signs of a Tech Bounce	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Buried in a set of little-known data are early signs that the hardware side of the technology sector may be rebounding from the pandemic-driven plunge.Investors generally need to wait until a few weeks after a quarter closes to get a sense of how well (or badly) business has been, or hope that a company will provide an update when the situation changes. Except in Taiwan. A decades-old regulation requires companies there to report sales every month. This information isn’t useful only to investors in locally traded stocks. What’s listed is a broad range of companies that make chips, components, half-assembled modules and final products used in almost every electronics device in the world. The numbers can also provide a snapshot of output in China, where most Taiwanese technology manufacturers have the bulk of production.As early as January, it became obvious that the coronavirus would be a nightmare for tech companies. We now know that Apple Inc. posted a 7.2% drop in March-quarter sales of iPhones and iPads, while its major supplier, Foxconn Technology Group, suffered its biggest dive in revenue for seven years.More interesting is to see what’s been going on since. A look at April sales data from Taiwan enabled me to crunch numbers. What we find is a bounce in revenue that gives some hope for the global sector.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Foxconn’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. are the most famous names in this data set, because they’re the biggest in their category and have a VIP client list that includes Apple, Qualcomm Inc., Huawei Technologies Co. and Sony Corp. Yet hundreds of others, such as Pegatron Corp., Quanta Computer Inc. and Largan Precision Co., collectively supply most of the industry.By aggregating the data month by month, comparing to a year earlier to smooth out seasonality, and looking at the sub-sectors within tech — defined by the Taiwan Stock Exchange — such as components suppliers, chipmakers, or computer assemblers, we can get an understanding of what was happening just a few weeks ago.Computers and peripherals, which include major PC and server makers Quanta and Compal Electronics Inc., showed the largest rebound, from an 11.9% drop in the January to March period to a 7.9% rise in April.   Electronics parts and components, such as circuit-board supplier Compeq Manufacturing Co., turned a mild decline into solid growth, from a 3.1% decline into a 9.1% increase.   Other electronics, including Hon Hai, which not only assembles iPhones but servers and networking equipment, went from an 11.8% fall to flat.   Chips, headlined by TSMC, remained incredibly strong.   Optoelectronics, which is largely displays and camera modules, shows a prolonged decline.One of the key takeaways is the relative strength in corporate-focused hardware, and possible continued weakness in gadgets. Foxconn pointed to this earlier in May, when it told investors that its consumer-devices division, which encompasses iPhones, would fall at least 15%, while enterprise products would climb 10%.There are two important caveats to the data.The first is that they track just Taipei-listed companies, and not some big names like Huawei and Samsung Electronics Co., which also manufacture their own hardware. However, it’s a like-for-like comparison — those companies aren’t included in last year’s data, either — and the broad reach of Taiwan’s tech sector means that even Huawei and Samsung are likely part of its supply chain.A more important note is that this is just for one month. Some of that April uptick is simply catch-up production for time lost at the height of the pandemic. Yet clients wouldn’t place orders if they didn’t feel that there’s end-demand somewhere. Autos and textiles are cutting production and shuttering factories in the knowledge that such a pickup in sales isn’t likely. With global turmoil making companies reticent to give predictions, investors wait in the dark for an update or a quarterly conference call. Even if we don’t know whether this is a true rebound, or merely a dead-cat bounce, at least there’s more timely data available to examine.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

The company confirmed the appointment of Montella, who previously focused on Japan, Korea and APEC policy, according to his LinkedIn profile.The world’s biggest contract chipmaker joins a growing number of companies, including Huawei, with business links to China that are increasing their lobbying activities in the U.S., looking to gauge and lessen the impact from Washington’s ongoing dispute with Beijing.The stakes for TSMC became even higher earlier this month when a new round of U.S. curbs thrust it into heart of tensions over Huawei. Under the rules from the U.S. Department of Commerce, TSMC will have to apply for waivers from Washington for future orders from Huawei. The Chinese tech giant is TSMC’s largest customer after Apple, according to Bloomberg supply chain data, contributing roughly 14% of the chipmaker’s revenue.The Commerce Department announcement came hours after TSMC said it would build a $12 billion plant for advanced 5-nanometer chips in Arizona, a desicion designed to allay U.S. national security concerns and shift more high-tech manufacturing to America.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-makes-key-washington-hire-051319210.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-27	2020-05-27 09:12:09	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	There’s Far Less Bang in a Huawei Ban Now	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s easy to ban a product that’s difficult to get your hands on anyway.That’s why Britain’s possible move to impose a stricter ban on Huawei Technologies Co. seems opportunistic, even if it does now make sense. It’s taking advantage of harsher U.S. sanctions on the Chinese telecoms-equipment giant to consider extending the U.K.’s halfway measures unveiled with great fanfare in January. A final decision will come after the government’s National Cyber Security Centre reviews implications for the security of the country’s phone networks.Earlier this month, the U.S. imposed more stringent guidelines on Huawei, restricting any firm that uses American equipment from selling to the Chinese technology company without its approval. That means Huawei won’t be able to get chips from companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. because they’re likely made using machines from firms such as California-based Applied Materials Inc. So Huawei may effectively find itself cut off from access to the high-tech silicon it needs for its networking gear. This provides a convenient excuse for Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government to revisit its more nuanced approach with regards to Huawei, which provoked U.S. ire in the midst of efforts to strike a new Anglo-American trade pact and a rebellion from a group of Conservative lawmakers.Initially, in a break with the U.S., the U.K. had decided to retain some access to Huawei’s products for its carriers’ rollout of fiber-optic and fifth-generation mobile networks. It proposed capping the Chinese company’s share to 35% of non-sensitive parts of a mobile network in order to keep operators from being reliant on a Nordic duopoly of Ericsson AB and Nokia Oyj. Now ministers are drawing up proposals to reduce that share to zero.The irony is that, given the recent U.S. measures, Huawei may find it very difficult to keep competing for orders. The company probably won’t be able to buy many of the chip sets it needs to make things such as wireless base stations. The quality of those products will suffer as it’s forced to seek out new suppliers, likely in China itself, where semiconductor technology is still playing catch-up. That could make carriers rethink who supplies their 5G equipment even before any national ban kicks in, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anthea Lai.Even though a ban on new Huawei gear might now be easier, the question of how to handle the existing networks is not. Huawei’s equipment currently accounts for two-thirds of BT Group Plc’s mobile network, and one-third of Vodafone Group Plc’s U.K. mobile network, according to UBS Group AG analyst Polo Tang. BT has already said that swapping the kit out would cost it 500 million pounds ($615 million) over the next five years. Reducing it to zero could double that expense, Tang said.The U.K.’s previous 35% limit applied to an operator’s overall network, but forcing operators to replace any already installed Huawei gear would strain capital requirements and jeopardize ambitious goals for new network build-out — Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants the whole country to have access to gigabit internet speeds by 2025. It seems that the government is taking that into account. The Times of London reported that the new proposals would only prohibit the purchase and installation of new equipment from 2023.Which serves to underline how opportunistic the new review looks. The main argument for letting carriers continue to use Huawei was to ensure that network investment continued apace. Now that the U.S. crackdown looks likely to reduce the quality and availability of Huawei products, it’s a chance for the government to assuage both rebellious lawmakers and critics across the Atlantic. And with global antipathy toward China rising over its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak and crackdown in Hong Kong, there’s now little point in further testing the straining U.S. alliance.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2020-05-26	2020-05-26 03:09:04	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Japan’s Hottest Stock Is Tiny Maker of $40 Million Machines	(Bloomberg) -- The list of Intel Corp.’s annual supplier award winners tends to read like a who’s-who of the semiconductor industry’s biggest names. This year, it included a little-known Japanese company whose machines have become indispensable in the race to improve semiconductors and whose stock has been rocketing up as a result.Lasertec Corp. is the world’s only maker of testing machines required to verify chip designs for the nascent extreme ultraviolet lithography (or EUV) method of chipmaking. In 2017, Lasertec solved a key piece of the EUV puzzle when it created a machine that can inspect blank EUV masks for internal flaws. Last September, it cleared another milestone by unveiling equipment that can do the same for stencils with chip designs already printed on them. This March, Intel gave the tiny Yokohama-based company an award for innovation, its first after decades of doing business together.“That’s a major milestone for us,” Lasertec President Osamu Okabayashi said in an interview. “It means a lot to be recognized this way as a supplier.”The company’s stock has soared about 550% since the start of 2019, more than twice the gain of the second-best-performing security in the benchmark Topix index. Shares increased about 4% Tuesday, pushing its rise this year to more than 60%.Intel declined to say if it was buying EUV equipment from Lasertec, which already supplies test gear to its rivals Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The three chip fabricators are the only ones so far to announce EUV plans, because the technology is so complex and expensive. Okabayashi would only say that his company has “two or more” EUV customers.“This can be read as a sign that Lasertec’s tools are indispensable to Intel’s EUV roadmap.” said Damian Thong, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.Read more: Japan’s Star Electronics Stock Will Be Vital to Intel, SamsungEUV is just entering the mass production phase after two decades in development, but investors are already betting Lasertec will be one of the key beneficiaries. The move to EUV overcomes key hurdles to shrinking manufacturing geometries of semiconductors, allowing more and smaller transistors to be crammed onto silicon. It promises to unleash another wave of gadgets that are slimmer, cheaper and more powerful.Last month, Lasertec raised its annual order forecast for the second time this year to 85 billion yen ($789 million) in the period ending June, nearly double the amount it received in fiscal 2019. The company is headed for the fourth straight year of record revenue and profits. Sales will climb 39% to 40 billion yen and profit will jump 76%, according to its estimates. And that’s likely to be just the beginning.Samsung earlier this month said it is building a 5-nanometer fabrication facility that will use EUV to make processors for applications ranging from 5G networking to high-performance computing from the second half of next year. Taiwan’s TSMC is pushing ahead with plans to adopt 3-nanometer lithography mass production in 2022 and announced plans to build an advanced fab in the U.S. Intel’s first product made using EUV is expected late next year.Their primary focus is on so-called logic processors, used to power devices and networking applications, but the new manufacturing technique will eventually filter through into the production of DRAM and other memory chips.Read more: Samsung Takes Another Step in $116 Billion Plan to Take on TSMC“Logic makers will be first to adopt EUV, with memory makers following later,” Okabayashi said. “The real volume of orders will come when they reach mass production stage. Right now it’s 7- and 5-nanometer chips. 3-nanometer is still in development stage.”Okabayashi expects each customer will probably need several of his testers, which could cost well over $40 million apiece and take as long as two years to build. A chipmaker would need at least one machine in its mask shop to make sure the stencils come out right. Another would go into a wafer fab to keep an eye on the microscopic wear and tear that result from concentrated light being projected repeatedly through the chip design stencils.“Lasertec is still trying to get a feel for this market and how big it can be,” Macquarie’s Thong said. “Their stock is moving on expectation of future orders. But there is little actual visibility on the scale of this market, so Lasertec retains a lot of capacity for surprise.”(Updates with share price in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japan-hottest-stock-tiny-maker-210000713.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-21	2020-05-21 02:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Samsung Takes Another Step in $116 Billion Plan to Take on TSMC	(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. has begun building a cutting-edge chip production line intended to help it take on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in the business of making silicon for external clients.South Korea’s largest company said it’s started construction on a 5-nanometer fabrication facility in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul, dedicated to its made-to-order foundry business, an arena TSMC dominates. Based on the Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography or EUV process, Samsung expects the fab’s output to go toward applications from 5G networking to high-performance computing from the second half of 2021, it said in a statement.Samsung, the world’s largest maker of computer memory, smartphones and displays, in 2019 outlined its aim of spending $116 billion to compete with TSMC and Intel Corp. in contract chipmaking, making silicon for customers like Qualcomm Inc. or Nvidia Corp. Its announcement on Thursday coincides with the announcement of restrictions on the sale of semiconductors made with American gear to China’s Huawei Technologies Co., a constraint that threatens more than a tenth of TSMC’s business.“This will enable us to break new ground while driving robust growth for Samsung’s foundry business,” ES Jung, head of the contract chipmaking division, said in a statement.Read more: Behind Samsung’s $116 Billion Bid for Chip SupremacySamsung first unveiled its expansion blueprint in April 2019, outlining at the time its goal of hiring thousands and ramping up investment in logic chips in the years leading up to 2030. That initiative arose as sales of smartphones and consumer electronics plateaued and competition from Chinese rivals depressed margins.EUV is the latest and most advanced chipmaking method, requiring machines costing tens of millions of dollars and delivering better precision and performance in the chips it produces. TSMC and Samsung, through its spending plan, are the leaders in developing that process and expanding into 5nm and smaller manufacturing nodes.Before the arrival Covid-19, Samsung had begun collaborating with major clients on designing and manufacturing custom chips and that work was already starting to add to its revenue, a Samsung executive has said. The company’s newest fab in Pyeongtaek joins another 5nm facility in Hwaseong that will begin production in the second half of this year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-takes-another-step-116-020000830.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-18	2020-05-18 10:00:50	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Huawei Warns of ‘Terrible Price’ If U.S.-China Tensions Escalate	(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. warned the latest U.S. curbs on its business will inflict a “terrible price” on the global technology industry, inflaming tensions between Washington and Beijing while harming American interests.China’s largest technology company said it will be “significantly affected” by a Commerce Department decree barring any chipmaker using American equipment from supplying Huawei without U.S. government approval. That means companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and its rivals will have to cut off the Chinese company unless they get waivers -- effectively severing Huawei’s access to cutting-edge silicon it needs for smartphones and networking gear.Washington’s decision drew condemnation from Beijing, which regards Huawei as a national champion because of its success in dominating global networking technology. China and Huawei have threatened retaliation but Rotating Chairman Guo Ping on Monday refrained from commenting on a possible Beijing response -- a departure from just two months ago when the company warned Washington risked opening a “pandora’s box” and Chinese countermeasures if it chose to go ahead with additional restrictions.“Our business will significantly be impacted,” Guo said at a company briefing with analysts in Shenzhen. “Given the changes in the industry over the past year, it dawned on us more clearly that fragmented standards and supply chains benefit no one. If further fragmentation were to take place, the whole industry would pay a terrible price,” he added.Huawei is still assessing the potential fallout of the latest restrictions and couldn’t predict the impact on revenue for now, Guo said. On Monday, a swathe of Huawei’s suppliers from TSMC to AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. plunged in Asian trading.Guo was far less vocal than colleague Richard Yu, who runs the consumer division responsible for smartphones. The outspoken executive said the restrictions that ostensibly aim to allay U.S. cybersecurity concerns are really designed to safeguard American dominance of global tech.“The so-called cybersecurity reasons are merely an excuse,” Yu, head of the Chinese tech giant’s consumer electronics unit, wrote in a post to his account on messaging app WeChat earlier on Monday. “The key is the threat to the technology hegemony of the U.S.” posed by Huawei, he added.Yu also posted a link to a Chinese article circulating on social media with part of its headline asking: “Why Does America Want to Kill Huawei?”The U.S. is leveraging its own technological strengths to crush companies outside its own borders, spokesman Joe Kelly told analysts, reading from a prepared statement. “This will only serve to undermine the trust international companies place in U.S. technology and supply chains,” Kelly said. “Ultimately, this will harm U.S. interests.”Read more: Global Chipmaking Kingpin Gets Dragged into U.S.-China Trade War(Updates with more details from the Huawei briefing with analysts)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rules-designed-keep-u-tech-022503875.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-18	2020-05-18 04:13:45	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	U.S.-China Fight Over Chip Kingpin Rattles Tech Industry	(Bloomberg) -- Since its founding more than three decades ago, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has built its business by working behind the scenes to make customers like Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. shine. Now the low-profile chipmaker has landed squarely in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war, an incalculably valuable asset that both sides are vying to control.The Trump administration opened up a new front in the conflict on Friday by barring any chipmaker using American equipment from supplying China’s Huawei Technologies Co. without U.S. government approval. That means TSMC and rivals will have to cut off Huawei unless they get waivers from the U.S. Commerce Dept. TSMC has already stopped accepting new orders from Huawei, the Nikkei newspaper reported Monday.The move threatens to wreak havoc throughout the complex ecosystem that produces technology for consumers and companies around the world. An attack on Huawei threatens not just its workers and its standing as a world leader in making smartphones and telecom equipment, but also hundreds of suppliers. The Chinese government has vowed to protect its national champion, with threats of retribution against U.S. companies that depend on China like Apple Inc. and Boeing Co.“China likely will retaliate, and investors should brace themselves for a possible trade war escalation,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a research note on Friday.Read more: U.S. Tightens Rules to Crack Down on Huawei’s Chip Supply Huawei suppliers across Asia fell on Monday, with AAC Technologies Holdings Inc., Q Technology Group Co., Sunwoda Electronic and Lens Technology all sliding 5% or more. TSMC, which gets an estimated 14% of its revenue from Huawei, dropped as much as 2.5%.The U.S. already blacklisted Huawei last year, preventing American companies from supplying the Chinese company unless they got a license. The latest move tightens those restrictions to prevent chipmakers -- American or foreign -- from working with Huawei and its secretive chip-design unit HiSilicon on the cutting-edge semiconductors they need to make smartphones and communications equipment. The Trump administration sees Huawei as a dire security threat, an allegation the company denies.“We must amend our rules exploited by Huawei and HiSilicon and prevent U.S. technologies from enabling malign activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a tweet.Huawei countered by accusing the U.S. of ulterior motives.“The so-called cybersecurity reasons are merely an excuse,” Richard Yu, head of the Chinese tech giant’s consumer electronics unit wrote in a post to his account on messaging app WeChat. “The key is the threat to the technology hegemony of the U.S” posed by Huawei, he added.The U.S. decision is likely to hurt not just Huawei and TSMC, but also a clutch of American players including gear-makers Applied Materials Inc., KLA and Lam Research Corp. themselves, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. Disruptions to Huawei’s production will also hurt U.S. customers from Micron Technology Inc. and Qorvo Inc. to Texas Instruments Inc., they said. But “it bears repeating that any escalation of trade tensions is negative for the stocks overall,” they wrote in a research report.It would have been impossible to imagine TSMC becoming such a coveted chit between the world’s great powers when it was founded in 1987. Morris Chang, born in China and trained in the U.S., started the company as a so-called foundry, manufacturing semiconductors for any customer that didn’t want to construct its own fabrication facility, or fab.At the time, the business wasn’t nearly as glamorous as making chips yourself. Dominating the industry at the time were companies like Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which made processors for personal computers. “Real men have fabs,” AMD co-founder Jerry Sanders would say, making clear that was an insult.But in the intervening years, the foundry industry has become far more strategic for the technology industry. Customers from Apple and Huawei to Qualcomm and Nvidia Corp. have found they can innovate more quickly if they focus on chip designs and then turn to foundries like TSMC to produce them. Innovators in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence or the internet of things also depend on foundries to crack open new markets.Today, many of the chips for mobile phones, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and any other key technology are made at foundries. TSMC has become the leading foundry in the world by investing heavily in ever more advanced fabs, with annual capital spending of about $16 billion this year.It can now manufacture at 5 nanometers, about twice the width of human DNA, while China’s top foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., or SMIC, is at 14 nanometers. That makes TSMC’s chips far more powerful and energy efficient.Huawei and HiSilicon will have few good options if they are cut off from TSMC. One possibility is to procure off-the-shelf chips from Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc. and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co., an option Huawei’s rotating Chairman Eric Xu mentioned in late March. But even that may no longer be viable under the new Commerce restrictions.SMIC itself is keen on moving up the technology ladder, eyeing a secondary share listing that could raise more than $3 billion on top of a large capital infusion from the state.Read more: China Injects $2.2 Billion Into Local Chip Firm Amid U.S. CurbsBut that’s a longer-term endeavor and Huawei’s products meanwhile are likely to suffer, putting them at risk of falling behind those of rivals like Apple or Xiaomi Corp.For TSMC, it’s growing ever more difficult to remain neutral amid the growing tensions between the U.S. and China. The company brands itself “everybody’s foundry,” effectively the Switzerland of the tech industry. It supplies Chinese customers like Huawei and the American military, while relying on U.S. producers of semiconductor-making equipment like Applied Materials and Lam Research.TSMC did take one step closer to the U.S. last week, saying it would build a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona. The Department of Defense has expressed concern that overseas fabs may be vulnerable to cyberattacks and domestic manufacturing would assure a more reliable supply of chips.The proposal appears to be carefully calculated to address such security issues without too much damage to profits or its political balancing act. Suppliers to the military, such as Xilinx Inc., would be able to use the U.S. fab, but the facility would likely account for less than 5% of revenue so margins won’t be compromised.It’s not clear if the plans for a U.S. plant will win TSMC leniency in supplying Huawei, however.“TSMC will not be granted or granted a license based on their intent to build a 5 nanometer fab here in the United States. That’s not part of it at all,” Keith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment at the State Department, told reporters on a call. “There’s no assurance on that and we don’t anticipate that.”Meanwhile, China appears to be preparing to retaliate for the new restrictions on Huawei.

Now the low-profile chipmaker has landed squarely in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war, an incalculably valuable asset that both sides are vying to control.The Trump administration opened up a new front in the conflict on Friday by barring any chipmaker using American equipment from supplying China’s Huawei Technologies Co. without U.S. government approval. That means TSMC and rivals will have to cut off Huawei unless they get waivers from the U.S. Commerce Dept. TSMC has already stopped accepting new orders from Huawei, the Nikkei newspaper reported Monday.The move threatens to wreak havoc throughout the complex ecosystem that produces technology for consumers and companies around the world. An attack on Huawei threatens not just its workers and its standing as a world leader in making smartphones and telecom equipment, but also hundreds of suppliers. The Chinese government has vowed to protect its national champion, with threats of retribution against U.S. companies that depend on China like Apple Inc. and Boeing Co.“China likely will retaliate, and investors should brace themselves for a possible trade war escalation,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a research note on Friday.Read more: U.S. Tightens Rules to Crack Down on Huawei’s Chip Supply Huawei suppliers across Asia fell on Monday, with AAC Technologies Holdings Inc., Q Technology Group Co., Sunwoda Electronic and Lens Technology all sliding 5% or more. TSMC, which gets an estimated 14% of its revenue from Huawei, dropped as much as 2.5%.The U.S. already blacklisted Huawei last year, preventing American companies from supplying the Chinese company unless they got a license. The latest move tightens those restrictions to prevent chipmakers -- American or foreign -- from working with Huawei and its secretive chip-design unit HiSilicon on the cutting-edge semiconductors they need to make smartphones and communications equipment. The Trump administration sees Huawei as a dire security threat, an allegation the company denies.“We must amend our rules exploited by Huawei and HiSilicon and prevent U.S. technologies from enabling malign activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a tweet.Huawei countered by accusing the U.S. of ulterior motives.“The so-called cybersecurity reasons are merely an excuse,” Richard Yu, head of the Chinese tech giant’s consumer electronics unit wrote in a post to his account on messaging app WeChat. “The key is the threat to the technology hegemony of the U.S” posed by Huawei, he added.The U.S. decision is likely to hurt not just Huawei and TSMC, but also a clutch of American players including gear-makers Applied Materials Inc., KLA and Lam Research Corp. themselves, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. Disruptions to Huawei’s production will also hurt U.S. customers from Micron Technology Inc. and Qorvo Inc. to Texas Instruments Inc., they said. But “it bears repeating that any escalation of trade tensions is negative for the stocks overall,” they wrote in a research report.It would have been impossible to imagine TSMC becoming such a coveted chit between the world’s great powers when it was founded in 1987. Morris Chang, born in China and trained in the U.S., started the company as a so-called foundry, manufacturing semiconductors for any customer that didn’t want to construct its own fabrication facility, or fab.At the time, the business wasn’t nearly as glamorous as making chips yourself. Dominating the industry at the time were companies like Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which made processors for personal computers. “Real men have fabs,” AMD co-founder Jerry Sanders would say, making clear that was an insult.But in the intervening years, the foundry industry has become far more strategic for the technology industry. Customers from Apple and Huawei to Qualcomm and Nvidia Corp. have found they can innovate more quickly if they focus on chip designs and then turn to foundries like TSMC to produce them. Innovators in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence or the internet of things also depend on foundries to crack open new markets.Today, many of the chips for mobile phones, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and any other key technology are made at foundries. TSMC has become the leading foundry in the world by investing heavily in ever more advanced fabs, with annual capital spending of about $16 billion this year.It can now manufacture at 5 nanometers, about twice the width of human DNA, while China’s top foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., or SMIC, is at 14 nanometers. That makes TSMC’s chips far more powerful and energy efficient.Huawei and HiSilicon will have few good options if they are cut off from TSMC. One possibility is to procure off-the-shelf chips from Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc. and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co., an option Huawei’s rotating Chairman Eric Xu mentioned in late March. But even that may no longer be viable under the new Commerce restrictions.SMIC itself is keen on moving up the technology ladder, eyeing a secondary share listing that could raise more than $3 billion on top of a large capital infusion from the state.Read more: China Injects $2.2 Billion Into Local Chip Firm Amid U.S. CurbsBut that’s a longer-term endeavor and Huawei’s products meanwhile are likely to suffer, putting them at risk of falling behind those of rivals like Apple or Xiaomi Corp.For TSMC, it’s growing ever more difficult to remain neutral amid the growing tensions between the U.S. and China. The company brands itself “everybody’s foundry,” effectively the Switzerland of the tech industry. It supplies Chinese customers like Huawei and the American military, while relying on U.S. producers of semiconductor-making equipment like Applied Materials and Lam Research.TSMC did take one step closer to the U.S. last week, saying it would build a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona. The Department of Defense has expressed concern that overseas fabs may be vulnerable to cyberattacks and domestic manufacturing would assure a more reliable supply of chips.The proposal appears to be carefully calculated to address such security issues without too much damage to profits or its political balancing act. Suppliers to the military, such as Xilinx Inc., would be able to use the U.S. fab, but the facility would likely account for less than 5% of revenue so margins won’t be compromised.It’s not clear if the plans for a U.S. plant will win TSMC leniency in supplying Huawei, however.“TSMC will not be granted or granted a license based on their intent to build a 5 nanometer fab here in the United States. That’s not part of it at all,” Keith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment at the State Department, told reporters on a call. “There’s no assurance on that and we don’t anticipate that.”Meanwhile, China appears to be preparing to retaliate for the new restrictions on Huawei. On Friday, the Global Times -- a Chinese tabloid run by the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party -- reported Beijing was ready to initiate countermeasures, including imposing restrictions on Apple, suspending the purchase of Boeing airplanes and putting U.S. companies on an ‘unreliable entity list.’The list will cover “foreign entities that cause actual or potential damage to Chinese companies and industries,” the newspaper said.(Updates with Nikkei report in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-chipmaking-kingpin-gets-dragged-010627528.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-05-17	2020-05-17 16:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Taiwan Semiconductor Is Expanding Manufacturing in the U.S.	The world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), announced last week that is expanding its manufacturing footprint within the U.S., in line with rumors that surfaced in recent days.  The new facility will be built in Arizona, and TSMC says it received support for the project from the U.S. federal government as well as the State of Arizona.  The chip fabrication plant will use TSMC's 5-nanometer process technology and be capable of producing 20,000 semiconductor wafers per month.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1527cd39-d2b7-3bfb-9eaf-e45a1e4e0f02/taiwan-semiconductor-is.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-05-17	2020-05-17 09:22:18	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Taiwan Semi Has Not Received Any Assurance On US License For Huawei Tech Sale	Keith Krach, the US State Department undersecretary, stated that Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) has not yet been given any assurances that it will receive a license to sell US technology to Huawei, the Chinese multinational tech company.“There’s no assurance whatsoever on that,” Krach told reporters about the potential license.“I think roughly around 10-12% of TMSC’s business is China, and I think that is in essence almost primarily Huawei,” Krach said. “So they will be restricted unless they’re granted a license, and there is no assurances on that and we don’t anticipate that.”On Friday the Commerce Department announced that companies would require licenses for sales to Huawei of semiconductors made abroad with US technology.The requirement is intended to “prevent U.S. technologies from enabling malign activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.Also on Friday, Taiwan Semi confirmed plans to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona, which could produce as many as 20,000 silicon wafers a month. This is about 20% of the output of the chipmaker’s largest Taiwanese factory- and would create about 1,600 jobs for the region. The plant would be expected to begin production as soon as 2024.“While it is hard to be certain, we believe that TSMC announcing a U.S. Fab could remove the threat of further Huawei restrictions in the very near-term at least,” JP Morgan analysts told investors following the announcement.“This project is of critical, strategic importance to a vibrant and competitive U.S. semiconductor ecosystem that enables leading U.S. companies to fabricate their cutting-edge semiconductor products within the United States,” Taiwan Semi said of the new plant.Overall TSM shows a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy Street consensus, with 3 recent buy ratings, vs 2 hold ratings and 1 sell rating. Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $57 indicates 14% upside potential lies ahead. Shares in Taiwan Semiconductor fell 4% in Friday’s trading, bringing the stock’s year-to-date loss to 14%.

2020-05-15	2020-05-15 05:28:40	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC Plans $12 Billion U.S. Chip Plant in Victory for Trump	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to spend $12 billion building a chip plant in Arizona, a decision designed to allay U.S. national security concerns and shift more high-tech manufacturing to America.TSMC said Friday it will start construction of its next major fabrication facility in 2021, to be completed by 2024. While the investment falls short of its previous expenditure on cutting-edge factories, it’s a shift for a company that now makes semiconductors for major names like Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. mainly from its home base of Taiwan.As the world’s largest and most advanced maker of chips for other companies, TSMC plays a crucial role in the production of devices from smartphones and laptops to servers running the internet. Its decision to situate a plant in the western state comes after White House officials had warned repeatedly about the threat inherent in having much of the world’s electronics made outside of the U.S. TSMC had negotiated the deal with the administration to create American jobs and produce sensitive components domestically for national security reasons, according to people familiar with the situation.The Asian chipmaker’s U.S. investment underscores the delicate balance it needs to strike between its huge roster of American clients and China, which views independently governed Taiwan as part of its territory. Beijing’s ambition of creating a world-class domestic semiconductor industry has unnerved Washington, which fears the country’s technological ascendancy may pose a longer-threat. Executives at TSMC, which operates plants in Nanjing and Shanghai and makes chips that go into everything from 5G networks to American fighter jets, have emphasized the company is neutral.“The scale & technology is similar to what TSMC did in China, suggesting a balance between the U.S. & China,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts led by Mark Li wrote after the announcement. “Overall, this is probably the minimal price to stay neutral. TSMC needs both U.S. & China to maintain scale & stay competitive and this is probably the minimal cost to keep this strategy.”Read more: Huawei Warns of ‘Pandora’s Box’ If U.S. Curbs Taiwan SupplyThe envisioned facility represents a small step in global industry terms. Upon completion, it will crank out 20,000 wafers a month, versus the hundreds of thousands that TSMC’s capable of from its main home base. And it will employ 5-nanometer process technology, a current standard that will likely become a few generations old by the time output begins in a few years.The higher cost of operating in America may have been a factor ahead of the decision. A true cutting-edge fab is expensive to build: The company spent NT$500 billion ($17 billion) to build an advanced facility in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan that will supply new iPhones this year. It plans another $16 billion in capital spending in 2020. The Arizona plant still requires approval from TSMC’s board, which may hinge on incentives.“There is a cost gap, which is hard to accept at this point. Of course, we have -- we are doing a lot of things to reduce that cost gap,” TSMC Chairman Mark Liu said on a recent analyst conference call.U.S. Won’t Tolerate Tech Fence-Sitters Any Longer: Tim CulpanIf the federal government provides cash for a U.S. plant, it’ll mark a shift in policy and rhetoric from a Republican administration. Trump’s White House has rarely supported such direct industrial intervention, favoring market dynamics. A similar government-backed effort with Foxconn -- Apple’s main iPhone assembler -- in Wisconsin has so far not created as many jobs as expected.However, emerging trends may be forcing a reconsideration. The U.S. government is already giving or lending billions of dollars to keep companies afloat in the midst of a pandemic-fueled recession. The crisis has also highlighted how vulnerable global supply chains are to such shocks.The White House may also be motivated by broader political factors. Trump has attacked international trade deals and tried to limit China’s access to semiconductor technology, seeking to contain the country’s technological ascent. TSMC said its Arizona facility will create 1,600 jobs and a deal to bring highly skilled work to Arizona may help Trump’s re-election prospects this year.“TSMC’s plan to build a $12 billion semiconductor facility in Arizona is yet another indication that President Trump’s policy agenda has led to a renaissance in American manufacturing and made the United States the most attractive place in the world to invest,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement.By producing chips for many of the leading tech companies, TSMC has amassed the technical know-how needed to churn out the smallest, most efficient and powerful semiconductors in the highest volumes. It manufactures important components designed by Apple and most of the largest semiconductor companies, including Qualcomm Inc., Nvidia Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and China’s Huawei. Shares of Applied Materials Inc., Lam Research Corp. and KLA Corp. rose on optimism that these U.S.-based providers of chipmaking equipment may face fewer export controls when supplying TSMC.Concentrating such valuable capabilities in the hands of one company in Asia is a concern for the U.S., especially when, across the Strait of Taiwan, China is rushing to develop its own semiconductor industry.TSMC’s local rival, GlobalFoundries Inc., has given up on advanced manufacturing and Intel Corp., the world’s largest chipmaker, mainly manufactures for itself. Its attempt to become a so-called foundry for external clients has failed to gain major customers. TSMC’s only other significant challenger is South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co., which is investing more than $116 billion in its effort to keep up with the leader.“TSMC welcomes continued strong partnership with the U.S. administration and the State of Arizona on this project,” the company said in a statement. “This project will require significant capital and technology investments from TSMC. The strong investment climate in the United States, and its talented workforce make this and future investments in the U.S. attractive to TSMC.”Read more: Foxconn Factory Subsidy Estimate Slashed by Wisconsin Agency(Updates with analyst’s comment from the fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-build-12-billion-u-031254174.html?.tsrc=rss

TSMC said its Arizona facility will create 1,600 jobs and a deal to bring highly skilled work to Arizona may help Trump’s re-election prospects this year.“TSMC’s plan to build a $12 billion semiconductor facility in Arizona is yet another indication that President Trump’s policy agenda has led to a renaissance in American manufacturing and made the United States the most attractive place in the world to invest,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement.By producing chips for many of the leading tech companies, TSMC has amassed the technical know-how needed to churn out the smallest, most efficient and powerful semiconductors in the highest volumes. It manufactures important components designed by Apple and most of the largest semiconductor companies, including Qualcomm Inc., Nvidia Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and China’s Huawei. Shares of Applied Materials Inc., Lam Research Corp. and KLA Corp. rose on optimism that these U.S.-based providers of chipmaking equipment may face fewer export controls when supplying TSMC.Concentrating such valuable capabilities in the hands of one company in Asia is a concern for the U.S., especially when, across the Strait of Taiwan, China is rushing to develop its own semiconductor industry.TSMC’s local rival, GlobalFoundries Inc., has given up on advanced manufacturing and Intel Corp., the world’s largest chipmaker, mainly manufactures for itself. Its attempt to become a so-called foundry for external clients has failed to gain major customers. TSMC’s only other significant challenger is South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co., which is investing more than $116 billion in its effort to keep up with the leader.“TSMC welcomes continued strong partnership with the U.S. administration and the State of Arizona on this project,” the company said in a statement. “This project will require significant capital and technology investments from TSMC. The strong investment climate in the United States, and its talented workforce make this and future investments in the U.S. attractive to TSMC.”Read more: Foxconn Factory Subsidy Estimate Slashed by Wisconsin Agency(Updates with analyst’s comment from the fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-build-chip-plant-arizona-185039746.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-15	2020-05-15 04:57:24	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Taiwanese Apple Supplier TSMC To Build $12B US Chip Factory After Months Of Pressure From Trump Administration	"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. (NYSE: TMC) announced on Friday (Taipei time) that it is building an ""advanced"" semiconductor manufacturing facility in the United States.What Happened The chipmaker said it expects the factory, to be built in Arizona, to cost about $12 billion over the course of nine years between 2021 and 2029. Production could start as soon as 2024, TSMC noted.According to the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) supplier, the facility is being built with ""mutual understanding and commitment to support"" from the U.S. federal government and the Arizona state government.TSMC said the manufacturing facility will utilize its 5-nanometer technology for semiconductor water fabrication and will have the capacity of 20,000 chip wafer per month. The plant will create over 1,600 ""high-tech professional jobs directly, and thousands of indirect jobs,"" it added.The Taiwanese company currently has one manufacturing plant in Washington and one design center, each in Texas and California.Why It Matters The move comes as President Donald Trump's administration has been reportedly pressuring the company to increase its production in the U.S. for months.The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has further threatened a supply-chain disruption to the U.S., as a majority of advanced chipmaking is done in Asia, especially Taiwan and South Korea.  The Wall Street Journal earlier this week reported that the Trump administration has been in talks with TSMC and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) to ramp up U.S. production in the wake of the pandemic.Price Action TSMC shares closed 2.3% higher at $52.10 in the regular session on Thursday and inched further higher in the after-hours at $52.50.Image Credit: Wikimedia.See more from Benzinga  * Apple Confirms Acquisition Of Virtual Reality Startup NextVR  * Morgan Stanley Analyst Says Many Investors 'Absolutely Adore' Musk's Dominating Strategy  * United Airlines Workers File Class Action Alleging Company Violated Federal Aid Rules(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-05-13	2020-05-13 09:00:28	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	American States Should Chase This Taiwan Company Instead	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Less than three years after Wisconsin won a beauty contest to lure Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group to the state, local leaders and voters have been left with buyers remorse. Founder Terry Gou’s stated plans to build a $10 billion plant making flat screens were illogical from the start, and taxpayers there now realize it.There’s another Taiwanese company that might be looking for a new American foothold. And this time, such a project makes complete sense.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is the world’s most important chip company. It makes high-end components using the best technology for clients including Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Yet it produces the bulk of its chips at three locations in Taiwan with additional capacity in China. TSMC has barely any footprint in America, owning one old factory in Washington state which it bought 20 years ago.U.S. national security concerns, protectionis, and a growing need to diversify have led me to conclude that a new American facility for TSMC is inevitable. A plan is now under discussion, but not yet confirmed, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal this week.The only question — beyond when, and how much — is where TSMC will put it.State governors need to pay attention. They’ve been burnt before, or at least Wisconsin’s Scott Walker has. His decision to push ahead with the Foxconn facility in 2017, at the cost of up to $3 billion in taxpayer-funded subsidies, is a major reason that the Republican governor lost reelection the following year.When then-presidential candidate Donald Trump started talking up a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing in 2016, Foxconn’s Gou put his team to work. The company is famous for assembling iPhones using hundreds of thousands of factory workers, mostly in China. As he built his empire, Gou accumulated decades of experience pitting local and national governments against each other with the promise of jobs and economic prosperity. Quite often, the plans never came to fruition, no matter how willing the locals were to make him a sweetheart deal. Within months of Trump’s victory, Gou had governors of rust-belt states — including Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Indiana —  eager to land what was described as a once-in-a-generation opportunity. In the end, Wisconsin’s package convinced Foxconn to break ground in Racine County as preparation for a massive flat-panel display factory that would provide 13,000 manufacturing jobs.I wrote back then, many times, that these plans didn’t add up. Flat screens aren’t native to American industry and the country lacks the trained personnel to staff such a facility. There’s already a global oversupply and little chance of strong growth. The product is too fragile to ship long distances. Foxconn has since scaled back its plans and failed to hit some employment targets required to receive incentives. But just 60 miles away from Foxconn’s Taipei headquarters sits TSMC, a company that would be a much better fit for the U.S. With tensions rising between Beijing and Washington, and the Covid-19 pandemic highlighting the risks to America having much of its technology supply chain overseas, TSMC is facing increasing pressure to boost its U.S. presence.At first thought, California might seem the obvious place to host a new factory. After all, that’s where TSMC’s largest clients are based. Ironically, given that it’s home to Silicon Valley — a name derived from the metal used to make integrated circuits — the state has relatively few chip manufacturing facilities. The big names of three decades ago have either merged, or gone fabless — meaning they design without making their own chips.In fact, America’s semiconductor production sector is spread across at least a dozen states around the country, according to my analysis of company data and press reports. (1)That could make a new TSMC facility in the U.S. up for grabs. And if making high-end display panels was a bad fit for Wisconsin, a chip factory fits well in the current and future structure of American industry. To this day, the U.S. remains the global leader in semiconductor design, development and manufacturing, with its universities churning out the best electrical and electronics engineers. TSMC founder Morris Chang is an alumnus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford, while the current chairman, Mark Liu, got his Ph.D from the University of California, Berkeley. Exactly how many jobs a U.S. fab might create is hard to predict. Earlier this year, Liu told investors that any factory there would deploy the company’s most advanced technologies, which work best at scale.As a comparison, TSMC employs over 10,000 people at its Tainan facilities, which utilize leading-edge manufacturing processes for Apple’s iPhone chips, and expects to add another few thousand in coming years. Given that semiconductor manufacturing engineer salaries in America can top $100,000, luring even half that number of jobs would be a boon for any state.The eagerness with which communities chased Amazon.com Inc. for the e-commerce company’s second headquarters shows that many local leaders are as eager to chase high-paid employment as they are factory jobs.With the prospect of the world’s eighth-largest tech company by market value looking for a new place to set up shop, U.S. governors are likely to find themselves back in the chase.(1) Data was collated from company statements, annual reports, and press reports for the past 5 years.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

""The timing is better and the demand for this is greater than it has been in the past, even from the commercial side.""According to the Journal, TSMC has also been talking to relevant government departments and its biggest customer Apple Inc.

2020-05-11	2020-05-11 04:36:01	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	U.S. Won’t Tolerate Technology Fence-Sitters Any Longer	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Ever since Donald Trump fired the first shot in the U.S. trade war with China, one technology company has been sitting in the middle, trying to avoid the crossfire. It’s wonderful to be able to sell weapons to all sides, until one forces you to choose.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is in the enviable position of being a critical supplier to both countries. The company, headquartered in famed Hsinchu Science Park, makes the world’s most advanced chips for the likes of Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co. The U.S. fear, as portrayed by the White House, Pentagon and Commerce Department, is that allowing China to procure the world’s best semiconductors while America is unable to make them at home is an urgent and critical national security threat. That’s spurred a two-pronged strategy in recent years: Limit Chinese access to and development of chip technology, and bolster domestic prowess.TSMC’s strategy has been to stay neutral. It has most of its capacity in Taiwan, one new and one not-so-new factory in China, and an old facility in Washington state. A year ago, I wrote that chairman Mark Liu had politely pushed back against pressure to expand in America, citing the steep costs. I concluded: “TSMC won’t be able to sit on the fence forever. While Liu may want to just make chips, he’ll eventually have to make a choice.”That day has come.  The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted Washington’s need to protect supply chains from disruption, and heightened concerns about reliance on Taiwan, as the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend. To that end, the administration is pushing hard to get chipmakers, including Intel Corp., TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co., to expand in the U.S., and to use their best technology, the WSJ wrote.Unsurprisingly, Intel is making the case that the U.S. should strengthen its domestic production for “geopolitical” reasons. The company has most of its staff, and more than half its plants and equipment, in the U.S., including manufacturing in Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon.While best-known for supplying processors used in PCs and servers under its own name, Intel also operates a foundry business that does contract manufacturing using clients’ own designs. Once the world leader in chip production, the Santa Clara, California-based company has fallen behind and now trails TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung.Intel clearly sees an opportunity. If it can convince defense and commerce officials that it’s in the interest of national security to mandate that at least some chips be made domestically, then it may have a shot at getting back into the foundry game. TSMC has been trying to push back, or at least to get a seat in the policy discussions. It recently hired former Intel lobbyist Peter Cleveland to coordinate its efforts in Washington. As the old saying goes, “If you’re not at the table, then you’re on the menu.”But the other aspect of American strategy may be harder for the Taiwanese company to negotiate. Beyond expanding domestic capacity, Washington wants to limit Chinese access. To do so, the Trump administration is considering new rules to curb the use of U.S. equipment and materials in making chips for the likes of Huawei, arguing that the Chinese company is a conduit for Beijing’s espionage.That’s put TSMC and numerous other companies in a difficult position. The American market accounted for 59% of its sales last year, against 19% for Chinese clients. Yet the growth momentum clearly favors the world’s largest country, which is focused on developing components used in artificial intelligence, 5G communications, surveillance and possibly weaponry. TSMC has attempted to play Switzerland. A year ago, the company was sticking with the line that “We are everybody’s foundry.”Washington increasingly wants TSMC to be its foundry alone. Pressure has ramped up significantly over the past year, with the long list of U.S. clients and significant revenue contribution being used as a battering ram to make the point that America is the side to choose. Ten years ago, when Taipei-Beijing relations were friendlier, companies may have leaned toward China. Today, with China showing increasing belligerence and the U.S. supporting a greater global voice for Taiwan, the mood has shifted.It’s true that China is an important and growing market — Beijing has used that momentum to bring global companies to its shores — yet it won’t replace the U.S. in terms of size or technology leadership in the next 20 years. To assuage concerns, and win a reprieve on restrictions about supplying to China, TSMC has little choice but to offer something to the Americans. After years of delay and resistance, it’s time for TSMC to build a shiny new factory in America. Expect to hear the company announce concrete plans, and large dollar figures for U.S. investment, in the next year or so.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

The company, headquartered in famed Hsinchu Science Park, makes the world’s most advanced chips for the likes of Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co. The U.S. fear, as portrayed by the White House, Pentagon and Commerce Department, is that allowing China to procure the world’s best semiconductors while America is unable to make them at home is an urgent and critical national security threat. That’s spurred a two-pronged strategy in recent years: Limit Chinese access to and development of chip technology, and bolster domestic prowess.TSMC’s strategy has been to stay neutral. It has most of its capacity in Taiwan, one new and one not-so-new factory in China, and an old facility in Washington state. A year ago, I wrote that chairman Mark Liu had politely pushed back against pressure to expand in America, citing the steep costs. I concluded: “TSMC won’t be able to sit on the fence forever. While Liu may want to just make chips, he’ll eventually have to make a choice.”That day has come.  The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted Washington’s need to protect supply chains from disruption, and heightened concerns about reliance on Taiwan, as the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend. To that end, the administration is pushing hard to get chipmakers, including Intel Corp., TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co., to expand in the U.S., and to use their best technology, the WSJ wrote.Unsurprisingly, Intel is making the case that the U.S. should strengthen its domestic production for “geopolitical” reasons. The company has most of its staff, and more than half its plants and equipment, in the U.S., including manufacturing in Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon.While best-known for supplying processors used in PCs and servers under its own name, Intel also operates a foundry business that does contract manufacturing using clients’ own designs. Once the world leader in chip production, the Santa Clara, California-based company has fallen behind and now trails TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung.Intel clearly sees an opportunity. If it can convince defense and commerce officials that it’s in the interest of national security to mandate that at least some chips be made domestically, then it may have a shot at getting back into the foundry game. TSMC has been trying to push back, or at least to get a seat in the policy discussions. It recently hired former Intel lobbyist Peter Cleveland to coordinate its efforts in Washington. As the old saying goes, “If you’re not at the table, then you’re on the menu.”But the other aspect of American strategy may be harder for the Taiwanese company to negotiate. Beyond expanding domestic capacity, Washington wants to limit Chinese access. To do so, the Trump administration is considering new rules to curb the use of U.S. equipment and materials in making chips for the likes of Huawei, arguing that the Chinese company is a conduit for Beijing’s espionage.That’s put TSMC and numerous other companies in a difficult position. The American market accounted for 59% of its sales last year, against 19% for Chinese clients. Yet the growth momentum clearly favors the world’s largest country, which is focused on developing components used in artificial intelligence, 5G communications, surveillance and possibly weaponry. TSMC has attempted to play Switzerland. A year ago, the company was sticking with the line that “We are everybody’s foundry.”Washington increasingly wants TSMC to be its foundry alone. Pressure has ramped up significantly over the past year, with the long list of U.S. clients and significant revenue contribution being used as a battering ram to make the point that America is the side to choose. Ten years ago, when Taipei-Beijing relations were friendlier, companies may have leaned toward China. Today, with China showing increasing belligerence and the U.S. supporting a greater global voice for Taiwan, the mood has shifted.It’s true that China is an important and growing market — Beijing has used that momentum to bring global companies to its shores — yet it won’t replace the U.S. in terms of size or technology leadership in the next 20 years. To assuage concerns, and win a reprieve on restrictions about supplying to China, TSMC has little choice but to offer something to the Americans. After years of delay and resistance, it’s time for TSMC to build a shiny new factory in America. Expect to hear the company announce concrete plans, and large dollar figures for U.S. investment, in the next year or so.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-05-06	2020-05-06 09:09:15	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	China Chipmaker’s $3 Billion Listing a Hedge Against U.S. Curbs	(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. is planning a Shanghai share sale that could fetch billions of dollars for a Chinese chipmaker Beijing’s counting on to help reduce reliance on U.S. technology.The Hong Kong-listed company known as SMIC surged 11%, the most in more than two years, after its board approved plans to float as many as 1.69 billion new shares on a Shanghai market created to host fast-growing enterprises. It could end up raising more than $3 billion based on its closing value of more than $11 billion.SMIC is one of several chip companies that embody Beijing’s hope of creating a self-reliant and world-class semiconductor industry. It plans to use the proceeds to develop next-generation chipmaking to try and compete with Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. That effort comes at a time the Trump administration may tighten restrictions on the sale of technology to China, threatening to deny domestic companies like SMIC or Huawei Technologies Co. access to crucial components and circuitry.“Strategically, we believe SMIC is gradually severing ties to the U.S. capital markets, as the tension between the U.S. and China escalates because of Covid-19 and another round of trade war is brewing,” Bernstein analysts wrote in a note.Read more: Huawei Warns of ‘Pandora’s Box’ If U.S. Curbs Taiwan SupplySMIC’s decision moves the tech giant closer to its roots, following its voluntary delisting of American depositary shares from New York last year. Its envisioned listing is a boost for the Sci-Tech Innovation Board -- better known as the STAR market -- which has struggled to attract major technology companies since its launch last year. The offering could raise some $3.2 billion and add to an existing cash pile of about $2.2 billion, according to Sanford C. Bernstein analysts Mark Li, Hanxu Wang and Edward Hou.It aims to pour new funds into research and deepen its capability in 12-inch wafers, helping it better compete with far larger rival TSMC, especially as Washington considers constraints against the Taiwanese company as well.Like TSMC, SMIC is a so-called foundry that helps fabricate silicon based on other companies’ designs. It currently competes against its bigger rival in nodes larger than 14 nanometers, a technology widely used in processors for smartphones and servers. But it lags behind in more advanced technologies that customers from Apple Inc. to Huawei crave.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-chipmaker-3-billion-listing-090915705.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-28	2020-04-28 03:38:45	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Autos Are Driving in the Chip Industry's Blind Spot	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For years, technologists have been talking about smarter cars packed with sensors, chips and supercomputers that can replace human drivers.That was enough to get investors excited about the future of automotive semiconductors. An earnings report from NXP Semiconductors NV late Monday reminds us of one slight flaw in the plan: People need to actually buy cars.The Dutch company said revenue will drop approximately 20% this quarter to around $1.8 billion. The figure is in line with estimates that analysts slashed by 23% over the past eight weeks. NXP cut its first-quarter revenue estimate at the start of March, only to fall short of that mark. The company forecast a second-quarter operating loss of as much as $237 million, versus an estimated deficit of $169 million.So far this year, much of the attention in semiconductors has been on whether smartphones are a necessity —  Xiaomi Corp. thinks so, I disagree — and whether work-from-home and streaming demand will drive server sales enough to make up for the drop in consumer spending. The outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. suggests otherwise.NXP, however, is playing in a different arena: It got 47% of its revenue from automotive clients last year. The company said Monday that it was “navigating a challenging and very fluid environment.” That’s an understatement. After a 4.5% decline in global automobile shipments in 2018 and a 3.9% drop last year, hopes that the industry might avoid a third year of contraction are out the window as the Covid-19 pandemic hits demand and supply.NXP isn’t alone. Germany’s Infineon Technologies AG gets 43% of its revenue from the auto sector. This month, the company completed its $9.3 billion(1) acquisition of California’s Cypress Semiconductor Corp. You’ll never guess which sector accounts for 39% of that company’s business. Forgive Infineon shareholders if they start to feel that the 47% premium they paid for Cypress might be a little steep. Ironically, shareholders seem to be forgiving management, with the stock rebounding from a mid-March low to be 30% off its February peak, and back to where it was in early October.Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Anand Srinivasan has been ahead of the curve. He predicted two weeks ago that the then-consensus estimate for a 4% decline in NXP revenue this year was conservative, and that 6% might be more realistic. Today, data on the Bloomberg terminal points to a 10% drop, the worst since the financial crisis in 2009.At Infineon, analysts are looking at a 7% drop in sales for the year ending Sept. 30. That may also be conservative.Xiaomi may believe that smartphones are a must-have, and Apple Inc. certainly hopes that its new iPhone SE will find favor even among tight-fisted consumers. But with a global recession on the way, you’d have to be Elon Musk to believe that the auto sector, and the chipmakers that supply them, are going to survive with only minor bruising.(1) Equity plus debt in an all-cash dealThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-04-24	2020-04-24 17:48:57	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Nvidia Reportedly Eyeing 5nm Chips Even As Apple, AMD Ramp Up Orders	From the 250nm process node in 1997 to the 7nm node in 2018, the chip industry has consistently strived to shrink the node in a bid to increase transistor density and reduce power consumption. Pure-play semiconductor foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) has now embarked on manufacturing 5nm process nodes, with  reports  suggesting volume production could start this month.Graphics chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is reportedly looking to use TSMC's 5nm process nodes, according to  Tom's Hardware,  which quoted a report in Digitimes.Since the yet-to-be-released Ampere graphics card is supposed to come with the 7nm process technology, it is unlikely that Nvidia will release a consumer GPU with a 5nm chip anytime soon, Tom's Hardware said. It's unknown as to how Nvidia could deploy the 5nm chips.Apart from the 5nm chips, the Digitimes report said Nvidia has also placed large orders for 16nm, 12nm and 7nm nodes, with the former two used in the company's Tegra X1 processor meant for the NINTENDO LTD/ADR (OTC: NTDOY) Switch and GPUs based on the Pascal and Volta architectures, while the latter is being ordered for the Ampere architecture-based GPUs.Rivals Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) have also placed 5nm orders, the report said. AMD is likely to take a plunge into the 5nm technology with its EPYC Genoa processors.Nvidia shares were trading 1.12% higher at $287.18 at the time of publication Friday.

2020-04-21	2020-04-21 21:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Shunned by U.S., Huawei Winning in China’s $170 Billion 5G Race	(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. is emerging as the runaway winner in China’s $170 billion effort to build out its fifth-generation wireless networks, part of a concerted effort by Beijing to seize the lead in a key technology from the U.S. while rebooting a virus-stricken economy.Since the beginning of the year, Huawei has secured 28.4 billion yuan ($4 billion) worth of 5G equipment orders from the country’s largest carrier, China Mobile Ltd., beating out competitors like Ericsson AB and ZTE Corp. to win more than half of the 5G contracts awarded by the operator during the period, according to an analysis of procurement data by Bloomberg News.The haul shows Huawei is benefiting from the domestic market and building its telecommunications expertise despite the Trump administration’s blacklisting last year. Beijing has forcefully defended Huawei, and the country’s three wireless operators -- all state-backed -- have added support through network contracts.While China has spent years striving for leadership in 5G, the effort took on greater urgency after the coronavirus led to the nation’s first economic contraction in decades. In a meeting with senior officials in March, Chinese President Xi Jinping singled out the technology’s importance for rebooting the economy. Weeks later, the country’s telecom regulator said China will “make every effort” to hasten the expansion of 5G coverage.“The focus on buildouts, handsets, and other metrics misses the fact that 5G will be a platform where innovative Chinese companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and a host of new tech unicorns will be able to build new applications and use cases,” said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at Eurasia Group. “Beijing wants Chinese companies to lead in this race to innovate on top of 5G.”China is entrusting Huawei to galvanize 5G tech, a cornerstone of a national “new infrastructure” blueprint that covers nascent technologies from the Internet of Things and autonomous driving to surveillance and factory automation. An early and successful rollout could help solidify Huawei’s position as a world leader in 5G.More deals are on the horizon. China has earmarked 1.2 trillion yuan to build 5G networks in the next five years, directly creating more than 3 million jobs in related sectors, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government think tank. IDC telecom analyst Cui Kai said 5G investment will continue to climb and peak in 2022 or 2023.This year, China’s three state-owned telecom carriers will spend a total of 180 billion yuan on 5G-related projects, including base stations and smartphones. China Telecom and China Unicom still have to announce bidding results.The 5G contracts give Huawei a much-needed boost as some projects in Europe grind to a halt because of Covid-19. Huawei this week reported revenue growth slowed to 1.4% in the first three months -- down from 19% over all of 2019 -- following pressure from the U.S. and dampening demand brought about by the outbreak.The Shenzhen-based company clinched deals to build more than 132,000 base stations for China Mobile across the country worth 21.4 billion yuan. The telecom carrier awarded rival ZTE Corp. 5G base station contracts worth 10 billion yuan, while Ericsson’s haul was around half of that. Nokia Oyj, which runs its China business via a joint venture with a local partner, didn’t get any of the business.Huawei won 56% of total orders by China Mobile for slicing packet network construction, or SPN, responsible for 5G data transmission between base stations and the core network. This brought in another 5.6 billion yuan in revenue.Huawei and ZTE also split 5G data management orders worth 1 billion yuan, leaving a fraction of the order to Ericsson, according to two separate procurement documents from China Mobile.In addition to 5G infrastructure, China Mobile placed orders with Huawei’s consumer electronics unit from the beginning of the year, including for about 70,000 units of the latest 5G smartphones and 140,000 5G portable Wi-Fi devices, without providing the procurement price. Most 5G phones in China cost around 4,000 yuan retail but carriers usually buy popular smartphone models from vendors at a discount.China Mobile had 31.7 million 5G package subscriptions nationwide as of March, more than doubling the subscription number in February, according to its website. 5G smartphone sales are expected to increase as more telecom carrier branches around the country place orders. Not all will be Huawei sales. So far this year, the carriers purchased more than 130,000 units of 5G smartphones from rivals Oppo and Vivo, the data show.Huawei’s 5G boost has benefited its suppliers. Shares of printed circuits board maker Shennan Circuits Co. Ltd. jumped more than 60% since the beginning of the year. Wuhan Fingu Electronic, a maker of radio frequency components used in base stations, increased by about 25%.Still, some doubt that 5G will be the savior that China is seeking. Gavekal Dragonomics analyst Dan Wang said that 5G doesn’t look like a big factor in moving the economy. “It’s a build-first-and-ask-questions later approach led by the state,” he said. “There’s not yet a killer app.”Huawei has put up a fierce fight since Washington banned the Chinese company from getting key American technologies last year. In the latest development, the Trump administration was said to consider imposing restrictions on the sale of semiconductors to Huawei by chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., a move that would effectively deprive the Chinese giant of using the most advanced chips.“There’s no question that China’s state-owned telecom operators can direct a lot of business to Huawei,” said Wang. “The company’s problem, however, is on the supply side. Escalating U.S. sanctions might be highly disruptive.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shunned-u-huawei-winning-china-210000702.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-21	2020-04-21 08:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Huawei’s Growth Evaporates After Coronavirus Compounds U.S. Woes	(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co.’s rapid growth slowed to a crawl in the first quarter after Covid-19 depressed demand for smartphones and networking gear around the globe.Huawei reported a mere 1.4% gain in revenue to 182.2 billion yuan ($25.7 billion) in the period, down from 19% over all of 2019. Its net profit margin shrank to 7.3% from 8% a year earlier, the company told reporters.The novel coronavirus has hammered demand for the smartphones Huawei relies on to compete with Apple Inc. and drive growth, especially now the global rollout of 5G networks has decelerated. The pandemic came on top of a difficult 2019, when the Trump administration blacklisted China’s largest technology company -- cutting off access to crucial American components -- and waged a campaign to get allies to exclude its telecom equipment.Huawei has warned of a challenging year with the U.S. bringing unprecedented scrutiny to bear on a company it considers a threat to national security, a claim the Chinese company has consistently denied. Washington is said to be considering curbs on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s sales to Huawei, which relies on the contract chipmaker to produce its most advanced silicon.“While our growth rate has slowed, this is a resilient performance in the face of both the Entity List and the coronavirus,” Huawei Vice President Victor Zhang told reporters on a call.Read more: Huawei Warns of ‘Pandora’s Box’ If U.S. Curbs Taiwan SupplyHuawei is now relying on its home market more than ever to drive its business. While China experienced its first economic contraction in a decade in the March quarter, the country is recovering its footing after reining in Covid-19. China’s phone market shrank in March, according to data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology. But Apple saw its iPhone shipments rebound that month, suggesting demand in the premium segment may have been delayed rather than extinguished.“It’s under control and most stores are open,” Richard Yu, chief executive officer of Huawei’s consumer division, said in an interview in March, when the company launched its flagship P40 smartphone series.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-growth-evaporates-coronavirus-compounds-080000507.html?.tsrc=rss

TSMC's scale and high-quality technology allow the firm to generate solid operating margins, even in the highly competitive foundry business. Furthermore, the shift to the fabless business model has created tailwinds for TSMC. The foundry leader has an illustrious customer base, including Apple and Nvidia, that looks to apply cutting-edge process technologies to its semiconductor designs.See more from Benzinga  * Rite Aid: Q4 Earnings Insights  * Recap: Morgan Stanley Q1 Earnings  * Recap: BlackRock Q1 Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The move towards Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) comes as Washington readies new rules which would require foreign companies using U.S. chipmaking equipment to obtain a license before supplying chips to Huawei - rules that would directly affect TSMC.  It also highlights how U.S. restrictions against Huawei can act as an impetus for Chinese companies to accelerate the development of homegrown technology.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-chip-unit-orders-more-103958457.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-16	2020-04-16 09:52:38	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC's Outlook Isn’t the News You Were Hoping For	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. just posted net income that beat estimates, showed fatter margins, and forecast revenue surpassing expectations. Pretty impressive in a world where the Covid-19 pandemic is hitting economies and industries from all sides.But that’s the end of the good news. The maker of chips for Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., and almost everyone else, also provided a series of bullet points to investors that should make the whole sector worry.Let’s compare the outlook from three months ago to what the company told investors Thursday afternoon.Then: Global semiconductor industry would climb 8%.(1) Now: “Flat to a slight decline.”   Then: The made-to-order foundry industry, which acts as a proxy for chip designers, would climb 17%. Now: Possibly half that, in the order of “high single digit to low teens” percentage.   Then: TSMC’s own growth would rise more than 20%.(2) Now: “Mid-high teen” growth.An important caveat to this revised outlook, which might be considered rosy given current uncertainties, is that it’s based on the pandemic stabilizing in June. Let’s hope we’re that lucky. Even in some places that have shown success in battling the disease, such as Singapore and South Korea, new cases continue to mount. Outbreaks could recur until a vaccine is found and widely deployed.Economically, many companies continue to believe things are better than they really are. In China, for example, some executives in the tech sector seem to think that they’re immune from the financial malaise that’s playing out in the rest of the world. It will catch up with them.TSMC hasn’t abandoned all hope, at least in the long term. It maintained its previous guidance for capital expenditure this year of as much as $16 billion, based on the belief that industry trends like the rollout of 5G networks and handsets in coming years will still justify its investment in new equipment.Much of this view comes down to an educated guess. But TSMC’s extensive client list and years of experience riding economic cycles make its predictive power better than almost anyone else.ASML Holding NV, a TSMC supplier and one of the world’s biggest makers of chip equipment, didn’t even dare Wednesday to predict what its revenue might be this quarter or year. Halfway through last quarter, Apple threw out its previous guidance and didn’t take a shot at a new one. Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei made clear that the new outlook was based on TSMC’s own read of the end-market for devices, not on any indication that its semiconductor clients were cutting orders. That’s an oblique way of saying that customers haven’t reduced purchases yet, but they probably will. The task now is for global technology companies such as Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia Corp., Xiaomi Corp. and Huawei to adjust to the new reality. Some haven’t: Xiaomi last month predicted that smartphones are a necessity and demand would rebound quickly. Heading into earnings season, investors ought to examine how executives handle this crisis through the same lens that we assess political leadership. As with the epidemic itself, those who are the quickest to face reality and work to mitigate the impact will stand the best chance of getting through it unscathed. The deniers may not be so fortunate.(1) This figure excludes the memory-chip sector, which is calculated separately.(2) TSMC had forecast &quot;several percentage points&quot; higher then the foundry sector.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-04-16	2020-04-16 08:40:55	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Chipmaker TSMC’s Profit Soars on iPhone Demand	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is sticking with plans for aggressive capital investments in 2020, a sign from the technology bellwether of resilient demand despite a pandemic-induced downturn.TSMC, a barometer for the tech industry thanks to its heft in the global supply chain, on Thursday lowered its revenue outlook for the year by a few percentage points to reflect the new Covid-19 reality. But it still expects robust demand for the semiconductors in datacenters that are now hosting an unprecedented surge in online activity. On Thursday, executives adhered to their goal of ear-marking $15 billion to $16 billion for capital spending in 2020, up from last year’s $14.9 billion. And they forecast revenue growth of about 30% this quarter.In the longer term, the chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. will still have to contend with uncertainty as Covid-19 spreads across the globe. Taiwan’s largest company however is relatively more resistant to a downturn thanks to a commanding position in the production of high-end chips needed for everything from datacenters and gaming to video streaming. It also makes semiconductors for laptops, phones and other devices that people are buying for home offices.The world’s largest contract chipmaker said on Thursday it expects revenue of between $10.1 billion and $10.4 billion from April to June. That forecast followed a near-doubling of net income to NT$116.99 billion ($3.9 billion) for the three months ended March, when demand for advanced silicon remained steady during the pandemic. That helped offset a 9% quarter-on-quarter slide in revenue from smartphones. Executives hedged their outlook for revenue this year on Thursday, saying it will rise by a mid- to high-teens percentage from a previous forecast for growth of more than 17%.“We don’t see any significant reduction in our customer demand. But we do expect the end-demand will have some impact in the second half of this year,” Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei told analysts on a conference call.Read our live blog on earnings here.TSMC’s revenue rose 42% in the first quarter to NT$310.6 billion, based on previously reported monthly numbers. That’s despite top customer Apple withdrawing its revenue outlook for the current quarter because of work slowdowns and lower demand in China, its biggest international market. But official data showed iPhone shipments in China jumped 19% in March, suggesting demand was bouncing back in the world’s top smartphone arena, at least compared with the previous-generation iPhone.Beyond a potential economic downturn, TSMC may also have to contend with fallout from the U.S.-China trade war.Washington is said to be considering curbs on TSMC’s sales to Huawei, which relies on the chipmaker to produce its most advanced silicon. China’s biggest tech company, which the U.S. accuses of aiding Beijing in espionage, accounts for about 10% of the Taiwanese chipmaker’s revenue. TSMC Chairman Mark Liu has downplayed the risk to its business, saying growth will still come from a global 5G roll-out.”We do sense there is an urgency from the industry that having the rule changed will hurt the U.S. semiconductor community. And we share the same opinion,” Wei said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-chipmaker-tsmc-profit-soars-053740028.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-07	2020-04-07 02:53:24	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Samsung’s Profit Beat Showcases a Rare Bright Spot in a Pandemic	(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co.’s better-than-expected profit revives hopes that a surge in internet usage from people sheltering in place during the Covid-19 pandemic will help make up for a drop-off in demand for smartphones and other consumer electronics.Shares in Korea’s largest company climbed more than 3% after it posted operating profit of 6.4 trillion won ($5.2 billion) in the March quarter, surpassing the average analyst estimate by 3.6%. Sales rose 5% to 55 trillion won, according to preliminary results released Tuesday. The company didn’t provide net income or break out divisional performance, which it will do later this month when it releases final numbers.Samsung -- one of the first major technology corporations to unveil March quarter results -- demonstrates how the novel coronavirus outbreak is exerting an uneven impact on the global electronics sector in the short term. Soaring online activity from gaming to video streaming is driving sales of semiconductors -- the lubricant for the internet and Samsung’s most profitable business -- even as worsening employment prospects curtail spending on gadgets such as the company’s just-released flagship Galaxy S20.The Asian giant’s solid performance underscores expectations for resilient chip demand since Micron Technology Inc.’s stronger than anticipated outlook. That lifted Asian chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Nanya Technology Corp. Much now hinges on whether governments can mitigate the fallout from potentially the worst global economic shock in at least a generation.“Right now, we can only project a picture of the second quarter: soaring demand in server chips may offset slump in display, mobile and consumer electronics,” said Song Myung-sup, analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “The problem is, if the Covid-19 pandemic continues further, we can’t guarantee that the uptrend in expansion of servers will be sustainable in the second half of this year.”Samsung’s Symptom-Less Earnings Don’t Make It Immune: Tim CulpanAs the world’s largest maker of memory chips, phones, displays and appliances, Samsung is broadly exposed to the economic shocks of Covid-19. Despite Tuesday’s rally, the company’s shares remain down about a fifth since their January 2020 peak. The better-than-expected result unveiled Tuesday was helped by the South Korean won weakening about 5% against the dollar in the first quarter, lifting the value of income repatriated from overseas.Should the pandemic persist into the second half -- a worst-case scenario -- the tech giant foresees missing its own 2020 revenue projections by a double-digit percentage, according to people familiar with internal discussions. It’s grappling with plant shutdowns and store closures this quarter alongside rivals and customers like Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. At the same time, memory chipmakers have experienced rising demand and prices for DRAM and flash memory used in data centers and cloud service operators.Read more: Working From Home Gives Chipmakers Boost While Others SufferWhat Bloomberg Intelligence SaysSamsung Electronics’ strong 1Q operating profit beat may affirm rival Micron’s upbeat expectations for memory chip demand, despite the Covid-19 outbreak. DRAM contract prices rose in March after reaching a bottom in December, while those for NAND inched up from late 3Q. Chipmakers’ wafer cuts may tighten supply and restore inventory to normal levels.&#92;- Anthea Lai, analystClick here for the research.Contract prices for 32-gigabyte DRAM server modules rose roughly 12% in the March quarter, according to InSpectrum Tech Inc. Prices for 128-gigabit MLC NAND flash memory chips increased about 5.6% in the first three months of 2020. Thanks to growing demand for online services from video-conferences to e-commerce and gaming, prices of server DRAM and enterprise SSD or solid-state drives are projected to keep growing in the current quarter. TrendForce raised its price-growth forecasts on server DRAM to 20%, while it expects enterprise SSD prices to rise by as much as 15%.“The growing demand for server DRAM led to low inventory levels for both clients and suppliers,” TrendForce said in an April 1 note. “Also, following a new round of tenders from Chinese telecom operators in February, the supply of server DRAM has become much tighter, in turn maintaining the upward pull on server DRAM prices.”Samsung’s hardest-hit business was mobile because of disappointing demand for S20 devices released in early March. In the first quarter, the company shut its key Gumi plant several times after discovering infection among employees, prompting the shift of some of output to Vietnam. Lockdowns of major cities and store closures across North America have depressed overall business. Hana Financial Investment expects Samsung to report 62.2 million unit shipments of smartphones for the first quarter of 2020, compared with 71.5 million units a year earlier.“Although semiconductor earnings look set to increase on the back of memory chip price hikes, the divisions selling finished products” will likely see their earnings decline, said Greg Roh, senior vice president at HMC Securities.Samsung’s Beauty and Beast: Fully ChargedFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-beats-estimates-covid-19-234129163.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-31	2020-03-31 10:00:50	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Huawei Warns of ‘Pandora’s Box’ If U.S. Curbs Taiwan Supply	(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. is bracing for its most difficult year on record in 2020, when tightening U.S. sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic threaten to slam an already slowing business.Rotating Chairman Eric Xu said he’s aware of the potential for Washington to tighten restrictions on the company, including by stopping Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. from selling chips to Huawei. The Chinese government wouldn’t tolerate such action and it would irrevocably damage the global supply chain, Xu said in some of Huawei’s strongest comments against the Trump administration’s measures so far.“If the Pandora’s box were to be opened, we’ll probably see catastrophic damage to the global supply chain -- and it won’t just be one company, Huawei, destroyed,” Xu told reporters after unveiling 2019 earnings. “I don’t think the Chinese government will just watch and let Huawei be slaughtered on a chopping board. I believe the Chinese government will also take some countermeasures.”China’s biggest tech company remains in Washington’s cross-hairs even as Covid-19 spreads across the globe. The White House is reportedly considering imposing restrictions on the sale of semiconductors to Huawei by global corporations such as TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co., a move that would effectively deprive the Chinese giant of the most advanced chip technology. That would escalate already damaging restrictions on Huawei, which on Tuesday reported net profit grew 5.6% -- the slowest pace of bottom line growth in three years.“Why can’t China ban the use of American 5G chips, base stations, smartphones and other smart devices based on the same network security reasons?” Xu said, adding he couldn’t confirm reports about curbs on TSMC.Huawei had previously reported sales growth of about 19%, to 859 billion yuan ($123 billion) in 2019, roughly the same as in the previous year. And the Shenzhen-based company’s profit improved to 62.7 billion yuan. But Xu said 2019 was its most difficult year yet, when it was forced to transform its business after expansive scrutiny and sanctions from the U.S. The effort to contain Huawei -- and by extension, China -- forced the company to turn inward.The Trump administration’s campaign to get allies such as Japan and Australia to shut out Huawei gear and phones helped drive sales in the Asia-Pacific down 13.9%, though that was more than offset by a surge at home in China.In the fourth quarter alone, which was most impacted by the U.S. prohibition on Huawei selling Android phones with Google’s mobile services, the company shipped roughly 55 million devices, calculated from the difference between its September shipments update and the year’s total. Of the 240 million Huawei and Honor phones shipped, 6.9 million had fifth-generation wireless networking, an area where the company remains a tech leader.Pelosi Joins Trump in Warning Europe of Huawei’s 5G ThreatContrary to warnings from American lawmakers and diplomats, numerous European countries like the U.K. and Switzerland have opted to use Huawei’s technology in building out their 5G networks. The U.K. and Germany have both echoed U.S. concerns about how far Huawei can be trusted with key infrastructure of the future, but those have not extended to the severity of an outright ban.Huawei faces tremendous pressure in overseas smartphone markets, where the U.S. ban on its use of Google Mobile Services severely undercuts the appeal of its devices. Without the Google Play Store and third-party app ecosystem, Huawei phones simply can’t compete with similarly capable alternatives from the likes of Samsung Electronics Co. and OnePlus. The company reported flat revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa alongside the drop in the Asia-Pacific. Those regions were two of its major growth engines in 2018, whereas now 59% of its sales are at home in China.China’s ambitious 5G network construction projects, which started in the second half of last year, also helped Huawei weather the international storm and sustain its core businesses.Huawei Makes End-Run Around U.S. Ban by Using Its Own ChipsFounder Ren Zhengfei initially estimated that Huawei’s May 2019 blacklisting by the U.S. could wipe $30 billion off annual revenues and threaten his company’s very survival, though he has tempered that outlook more recently. Huawei mobilized a massive effort to develop in-house alternatives to American software and circuitry, while U.S. suppliers like Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. found ways to continue supplying Huawei vital components it needed to make its products. Huawei is also selling base stations free of American technology in another effort to bypass the U.S. ban.With no relief from U.S. sanctions in sight and the coronavirus pandemic stifling business across all industries, Huawei anticipates its most difficult year yet. Chinese smartphone sales, which the company is now particularly sensitive to, are already hurting. And its global 5G installations, for which Huawei has secured more than 90 contracts worldwide, are hitting the brakes with many countries implementing lockdowns and the global economy at a standstill.(Updates with top executive’s comments from the second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-reports-jump-2019-profits-080500744.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-03-23	2020-03-23 05:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Shielded from Pandemic, Work Continues in World’s Cleanest Room	(Bloomberg) -- A two-hour drive south of Amsterdam in Veldhoven, workers decked out head-to-toe in protective gear toil in vast assembly halls. Before entering the inner sanctuary of the facilities, they meticulously layer on masks, gloves and special socks. A single speck of dust or a hair can have devastating effects on production. The result of all this painstaking process is an environment that is 10,000 times more purified than outside.And as the coronavirus grips the world, it might just be the safest place to work right now.The teams belong to ASML Holding NV, which holds a de-facto monopoly on the industry of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines needed to make next-generation chips. Each cost about 150 million euros ($160 million) apiece and ship mainly to the U.S., Korea and Taiwan, where the likes of Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., known as TSMC, rely on them to make faster, cheaper and more energy efficient semiconductors.ASML manufacturing staff operate in an environment that is literally shielded from the coronavirus pandemic that has forced millions of workers around the world to isolate themselves from colleagues to slow the spread of the disease. As the rest of the Netherlands and much of the continent locks down, work in ASML’s Veldhoven clean-rooms has continued largely unhindered, potentially giving the company an edge for when corporate life returns to normal.“So far we have been able to keep our production going,” said Frits van Hout, ASML’s chief strategy officer, ASML. “The situation is of course dynamic. We encounter challenges as with every lockdown our suppliers will be affected, directly or indirectly.”Keeping DistanceLike other companies, ASML has also implemented a raft of contingency measures –from segmenting staff to drawing up plans if disaster strikes at a key supplier -- so it can keep manufacturing equipment for chip-makers around the world. Workers are split into two teams and are screened for virus symptoms via infrared thermal cameras at the entrance of the clean room in Veldhoven.Social distancing protocols are in effect, and the company has spaced out the morning and night shift to ensure the groups don’t meet, ASML said.Clean rooms are highly specialized infrastructure that’s costly to set up and maintain, making that kind of environment difficult to replicate in other industries. The biggest risk for the company lies not so much in its own operations seizing up but in a potential breakdown of its 5,000 suppliers, 790 of which provide materials and equipment that are used directly to produce the ASML systems.Besides its ultra-sanitized work environment, ASML has the benefit of making machines that are considered almost recession-proof, given its commanding lead in an industry on the cusp of another technological leap: high-speed 5G networks.On Track“Most customers want EUV and if ASML cannot deliver due to such a factor, then they know they have to wait until the next quarter because you cannot get it anywhere else,” said Marcel Achterberg, executive director of equity research at KBC Bank.The prized EUV machines are the size of a bus. Customers can order older equipment, but EUV delivers better resolution, smaller components and improved performance in the chips it produces.They’re a crucial source of revenue for ASML’s customers, too. By the end of next year, as much as half of TSMC’s revenue will depend at least partly on some EUV processes, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Masahiro Wakasugi.Volume production of TSMC’s most cutting-edge 5-nanometer chips, which use EUV, is still “on track” for the first half of 2020 as previously stated by management, TSMC spokeswoman Nina Kao saidFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shielded-pandemic-continues-world-cleanest-050000867.html?.tsrc=rss

This has taken the price-to-earnings ratio below 12, and the dividend yield to almost 2.5%. The company had free cash flow of almost $17 billion last year so it's selling at just 13 times that.It's hard to think of bargains when you can't look at your portfolio, but if there's some cash or equivalents there it's time to count it. When the Dow Jones stops dropping, the rebound is going to be swift. There is an enormous amount of money on the sidelines, and there was even before the coronavirus from China.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome of that will go into Intel. Made Some MistakesIntel remains a flawed company that didn't get the full benefit of the tech sector's run-up. Under CEO Robert Swan it is being run out of the finance department. Its fabrication plants are now considered second-rate compared with those of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Even management admits that its 10 nanometer production will be less profitable than what it produced at 22 nm, because of competition. Hedge funds were dumping it even before the virus hit.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy After The Market's Historic Sell-Off Despite this, Intel stock has gotten the full brunt of the downturn, with shares down by about one-quarter. The company known as &quot;Chipzilla,&quot; co-creator of the integrated circuit with Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN), is no longer considered best of breed.Intel's old chips are highly insecure. The latest bug, called LVI, was found by teams of university researchers and will require a complete redesign to fix. It impacts five years of production.Intel is finding it hard to crack the memory market, after breaking with Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) a few years ago. Intel may have to work closely with Micron to meet its own needs.After telling people to work from home and banning travel to China, Intel then found an employee tested positive for the coronavirus after visiting its Arizona plant. Green ShootsWhy, then, am I telling you to fit this dog into your portfolio?First, you don't need to have the best chips to sell into the cloud. You need the most chips, and the cheapest chips. Intel isn't going to lose its data center business.Second, Intel is about to take this bargain approach into other niches. It has announced a full range of networking silicon for 5G mobile networks. It thinks it can grow that part of the business from $5 billion per year to $25 billion in three years. Through Barefoot Networks, acquired for $7 billion last year, Intel is demonstrating switches that run data at 12.8 Terabytes/second. This will expand its reach in the data center market.Intel may be second-rate, but it does rate. It expects to have 7 nm chips in production next year, and still hopes to lead when the industry gets to 5 nm a few years later. The Bottom Line on Intel StockIntel doesn't have to be the innovation leader to make money in chips. In the cloud era it's how many competitive chips you make that determines how much money you make.Intel is one of only four companies making microprocessors. The others are Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), Taiwan Semiconductor and privately held Global Foundries. The capital constraints of Moore's Second Law, in which manufacturing costs rise with chip complexity, guarantee it a place in the future.Given that reality, and its financial strength, Intel's comeback after the virus is guaranteed.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial journalist since 1978.

For now, though, Daiwa suggests investors “accumulate the stock on any weakness.”(Updates market levels in second and fourth paragraphs.)To contact the reporter on this story: Cindy Wang in Taipei at hwang61@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sofia Horta e Costa at shortaecosta@bloomberg.net, Kevin Kingsbury, David WatkinsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-much-love-tsmc-proves-054624560.html?.tsrc=rss

Then it sells off again. And then back up.Good news can be bad news -- and vice versa.It's all a bit confusing right now. And on top of it all, it's hard to pull out what is related to the coronavirus from China and what is just stocks finally going through a correction. Or both.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut instead of trying to figure out heads and tails in all this, just stick to good stocks that may sell off a bit. Those lowered prices will help during their inevitable rise.And the tech sector is one of the best places to look for these triumphs.Whether it's 5G, the Space Race or new equipment, there are some trends that will continue in good and bad times.  * 9 Stocks to Buy If People Get Stuck at Home These seven tech stocks to buy on coronavirus dips are the perfect examples. Tech Stocks to Buy: Esco Technologies (ESE)Source: Shutterstock Esco Technologies (NYSE:ESE) is one of those companies that has built a a formidable business that few people outside the industries it works in would know about.It manufactures and sells highly engineered products for the aerospace, defense and utility sectors. These are industries that have very specific needs and demand high quality, reliable equipment at every phase of their operations.When you become a key supplier over three decades, you have become part of an elite club. And that's very good for shareholders because these aren't the types of products that you look to save money on through a cheaper supplier. Equipment failure can be catastrophic and very expensive.Buying from a company with a long record of dependability is worth paying a premium price.And regardless of U.S. productivity in the short term, these industries are here for the long haul, and expanding.ESE stock is up 29% in the past 12 months and will be a steady grower for years to come. Itron (ITRI)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Itron (NASDAQ:ITRI) is another business that specializes in working with companies that are crucial to the U.S. infrastructure.In Itron's case, it offers smart networks, software, meters and sensors to electric and water utilities to help them better manage their resources. It has been helping companies and cities around the world since 1977.One of the best examples of what it does is its work in Paris, France. The City of Lights had a goal to cut its energy use by 30% over 10 years. It chose ITRI to help by looking at its complex system to see if it could find efficiencies and smart solutions to manage its 200,000 street and traffic lights.It also helps these utilities recover quickly and safely after major power outages or similar catastrophic events.  * 8 Stocks to Buy in March for a Coronavirus Rebound The stock is up 45% in the past year. And while some of that growth has been a flight to safety, it has a strong track record of reliable growth. That's what potentially makes a stock a great buy in my Growth Investor strategy. Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD)Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Aerojet Rocketdyne (NYSE:AJRD) has been around since 1915. It's one of the oldest aerospace companies in the U.S.Granted, it started as the General Tire & Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio. But over the years it was involved in radio, television studios, hotels and even an airline company.But by 1945, it started working with the U.S. Department of Defense on rockets. And since then, the company has been a leading supplier of aerospace technology to the Pentagon.Given the new Space Race that is underway, not only among nations but also private aerospace companies, AJRD is seeing a resurgence of interest from all these parties, especially in the U.S.Remember the U.S. is beginning to ramp up its Space Force, which will continue to grow and demand a great deal from its most reliable contractors.The stock is up more than 42% in the past year but only trades at a current price-earnings ratio of 30, which means it's not even trading at a significant premium. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of the world's top chip makers for mobile devices and one of the world's leading telecom equipment makers.It is so powerful that it has come up against monopoly issues and licensing fights with governments around the globe in the past five years.But those days are behind the stock. And demands for 5G upgrades are rising around the world.While there might be some issues with how countries are dealing with integrating Huawei's 5G systems into their telecom infrastructure, the fact is, QCOM is system agnostic. Its products work with all the major 5G telecom network infrastructures. And the buildout surrounding that technological breakthrough is a source of extremely compelling stock buys now.Certainly, there's an increase in competition these days for QCOM, but it has shown that it can survive competition and adversity with equal aplomb -- and expanding earnings.The stock is up 44% in the past 12 months, sports a mere 22 P/E and delivers a reliable inflation-trouncing 3% dividend. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is one of the leading chipmakers in the world. And its location in Taiwan has certainly been a blessing to many U.S. tech firms during the trade war.But those days aren't over yet. You see, while TSM is the top chipmaker for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it's also becoming a major chipmaker for China's Huawei, the largest telecom in the world.The U.S. government isn't happy about Huawei's growth and expansion, especially in 5G, where the Chinese telecom is closer to market than its U.S. competitors.The U.S. has threatened to limit the use of U.S. equipment to produce semiconductors for Huawei. Obviously, this would be a big deal for TSM.However, most people don't see this happening in an election year since this is a $96 billion industry and there would serious repercussion in the U.S. economy.The stock is up 38% in the past year and is still a major player in numerous tech trends that will be relevant in the next decade. KLA (KLAC)Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC) is all about process control and yield management. Of semiconductors.It's one of those companies that is a major player in the chip industry that no one ever hears about, except people in the chip industry or that cover the chip industry.But the point is, it is a major player, with offices and plants around the world.As 5G begins to roll out, so will new devices that are capable of processing the signals so they can reap the benefits of 5G's massive boost in bandwidth. And as these new generations of chips begin to roll out, so will KLAC's job of making sure they're built well.These types of companies can rise and fall with more forward-facing chip companies, but this business is necessary to any tech growth.KLAC is trading at a P/E of 24 and sharing a nearly 2.2% dividend. And that's after gaining 34% in the past 12 months. TransDigm (TDG)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com TransDigm (NYSE:TDG) is a producer, designer and supplier of highly engineered aerospace equipment, systems and subsystems for commercial and military customers.It has a number of brands underneath the umbrella that provide core systems. These systems get and keep most of the aerospace industry's products in the air.Given the upgrades and new projects on the military side and the growth in travel around the world, TDG is in very good position for solid long-term growth.Most of its offices are in the U.S., Europe and Asia -- the markets that are the biggest in potential for both traffic and clients.The stock is up 19% in the past 12 months and is seeing investors moving toward safety piling in.But, in the big picture, there are companies out there that offer not just safety, but a better world. Grab Your Slice of the 5G ProfitsWithin two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. That's a big deal for rural areas without broadband. And because 5G is 100 times faster than 4G, it'll allow your internet devices to work in real time. This advancement is a game changer for tech companies.Now, as amazing as 5G promises to be, it doesn't get us anywhere without the right infrastructure in place. You can never stream Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) using your smartphone plan (at any speed!) unless there's a cell tower nearby.With the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics … but their services aren't even available in some areas. And anyway, they can't compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it's got ultra-fast 5G. That's how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I'm targeting is enjoying an influx of big money on Wall Street, and it has strong fundamentals, too -- making it an A-rated &quot;strong buy&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system.Click here to watch my new, free briefing on 5G and how to capitalize on this extraordinary opportunity.When you do, you'll see how to claim a free copy of my new investment report, The Netflix of 5G, which has full details on this company -- and what makes it such a great buy now.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-03-02	2020-03-02 10:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Huawei Makes End-Run Around U.S. Ban by Using Its Own Chips	(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese technology giant barred from doing business with U.S. suppliers, is finding a way around the strict limits imposed by the Trump administration.The Commerce Department, citing national security concerns, has largely forbidden American companies from selling Huawei the computer chips it needs to make a piece of equipment integral to newly introduced high-speed wireless networks. In response, China’s largest technology company ramped up its own capabilities to manufacture the gear, which is known as a base station.In a sign that the self-reliance is working, Huawei in the fourth quarter sold more than 50,000 of these next-generation base stations that were free of U.S. technology, according to Tim Danks, the U.S.-based Huawei executive responsible for partner relations. That’s only about 8% of the total base stations that Huawei’s sold as of February, but the company is quickly ramping up at its secretive HiSilicon division to make more of these American component-free devices, Danks said.“It’s still our intention to return to using U.S. technology,” he said. The longer Huawei goes without access to U.S. suppliers, the more unlikely it is to be able to return to using them, Danks added.A base station is a typically suitcase-sized piece of machinery that’s used to help connect wireless phones to fixed-line networks carrying internet traffic, and it’s an essential ingredient in the next, or fifth, generation of mobile networks. Popular among telecommunications providers, Huawei’s base stations are widely considered among the most reliable for the price.Read about how Trump’s blacklisting of Huawei is failing to halt its growth.U.S. officials accuse Huawei of stealing valuable intellectual property and violating a trade embargo with Iran. The Trump administration blacklisted the company last year, saying there’s a risk Huawei could give Beijing access to sensitive data coursing through telecommunications networks that employ its gear. Huawei has denied the allegations. Critics also said the U.S. government imposed the sanctions to hobble China’s leadership in key aspects of 5G technology.As of early February, Huawei had shipped about 600,000 5G base stations to mobile phone companies racing to upgrade networks to the new standard, which is designed to deliver data at faster speeds to a broad range of wirelessly connected devices -- not just mobile handsets. Most of these base stations were made using stockpiled chips bought before the ban.While Huawei doesn’t disclose its suppliers, base stations typically rely on a kind of processor called a field programmable gate array that’s made by Intel Corp., a chipmaking colossus based in Santa Clara, California, and Xilinx Inc., in neighboring San Jose. Those chips provide flexibility that makes it easier to update machines as new standards and features are added. Huawei’s chips are application-specific, meaning they’re tailored to particular functions and it takes more time and money to replace them. That’s a disadvantage at a time when new technology, such as 5G, is in its infancy and still subject to big changes.Read more: Huawei Engineers Go to 24-Hour Days to Beat Trump BlacklistThe U.S. initially clamped down on all shipments of U.S. supplies to Huawei, which had spent more than $10 billion a year on U.S. products, but later began making some exceptions. Xilinx and fellow chipmakers Micron Technology Inc. and Broadcom Inc. have all reported falling earnings on reduced or eliminated sales to Huawei.Attempts by the U.S. to persuade European and other allied countries to ban Huawei equipment have fallen short, and chipmakers in Asia and Europe continue to supply it.For their part, American chipmakers have argued that banning the supply of parts that Huawei can get elsewhere is counterproductive, saying that the lost revenue crimps research and development budgets and the ability to produce the best chips in the future. Huawei’s HiSilicon chip unit designs semiconductors and has them manufactured by industry-leading plants owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. But Washington is even now said to be looking into ways to curb the world’s largest contract chipmaker on grounds of national security, and deprive Huawei of its largest semiconductor manufacturing partner.The Chinese company led the market for base stations with a 28% share last year, according to New Street Research. The investment company predicts demand for that equipment will rise this year with the 5G network buildout.

Samsung will fabricate at least some of Qualcomm's X60 modem chips, which will connect devices such as smart phones to 5G wireless data networks.  The X60 will be made on Samsung's 5-nanometer process, the sources said, which makes the chips smaller and more power-efficient than previous generations.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-samsung-wins-5-nanometer-130247394.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-02-18	2020-02-18 12:30:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Qualcomm Adds Another New Chip Aimed at Pushing 5G Adoption	(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc. announced its third new chip for 5G smartphones that the company said will help cellular service providers and deliver another improvement in mobile phone performance.The X60 is the chipmaker’s latest modem for the fifth-generation networks that debuted only last year and will become the mainstream service this year. The company said phones based on the new chip will go on sale in 2021. A modem is a type of chip that turns radio signals into voice and data.The part will allow a step forward in what’s called carrier aggregation, according to San Diego-based Qualcomm. That means phones will use a combination of the new higher frequencies that make up 5G and the airwaves relied on by older networks. Data will be sent to and from phones much quicker than using one narrower piece of spectrum.Phone companies, which typically own the rights to use scattered batches of airwaves, will be able to get more efficiency out of their expensive assets. That should help persuade the carriers, who are key in the rollout of 5G, that it’s in their interests to speed up introduction of the new service, according to Qualcomm.Qualcomm’s chip revenue has reflected the surge and the maturing of the smartphone industry. The company’s semiconductor sales peaked in fiscal year 2014 at more than $18.6 billion. In the last few years as consumers have held onto their phones longer, revenue has declined to $14.6 billion.The chip will also be the first to be made with 5-nanometer technology, the most advanced production technique in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm outsources its manufacturing to companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co.Qualcomm was among the biggest beneficiaries of the shifts to previous generations of mobile phone technology, when its chips became the market leader. In the decade since 4G began, smartphone sales have slowed given incremental improvements in form and function. That has hurt Qualcomm’s growth as the company is facing more competition, including from customers such as Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co.To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alistair Barr at abarr18@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Dan ReichlFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-adds-another-chip-aimed-123000696.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-18	2020-02-18 04:26:46	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple's Virus Cut Puts All Eyes on Tech Bellwether	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Apple Inc. has thrown out its March-quarter revenue guidance three weeks after providing it.Despite factoring in possible downside from the China coronavirus outbreak in its original forecast, the iPhone maker realized that things have deteriorated much more than it had anticipated. It gave no new figure and merely said the old one no longer applies, an admission that the company really can’t quantify the impact.While we should expect similar downbeat tones through the rest of the sector, this really means we should keep tabs on the one company that sits at the heart of the global technology supply chain: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.Apple is TSMC’s largest customer. When the chipmaker gave its own first-quarter and full-year forecasts Jan. 16, the world had barely heard of the disease now riveting its attention.Since then, Apple has shut stores in China and downstream assemblers like Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. have struggled to ramp up production after the Lunar New Year break amid continuing quarantines and a shortage of workers willing to return to the factory floor.Nvidia Corp., which designs graphics chips, is another major client of TSMC. On Feb. 13, it said the virus had cut its forecast by $100 million. That’s only around 3% of expected revenue for the quarter, but it all eventually adds up. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., not a direct customer, forecast a decline in revenue from its core businesses as consumers on its e-commerce platform shy away from spending. At least some of those lost sales will be electronics products, which use chips made by TSMC.Chinese companies, including Huawei Technologies Co., accounted for 20% of TSMC’s revenue last year. With numerous enterprises in China on lockdown, adding to the squeeze on both demand and production, it’s unlikely such clients will be able to escape the impact.And last week, wireless industry association GSMA scrapped its annual Mobile World Congress scheduled for Feb. 24 in Barcelona because most of its major participants had already pulled out. This isn’t a consumer event, but the cancellation shows the breadth and reach of the outbreak’s impact on business. Whichever way you look at it, the global tech slowdown leads back to TSMC. Revising guidance mid-quarter isn’t without precedent, and TSMC usually does with a statement filed mid-afternoon Taipei time. It did so a year ago this week, cutting its sales and profit outlook after facing troubles with chemicals used in the manufacturing process. The result was a 10% reduction in operating profit. Just a few months before that, a production hiccup caused by a computer virus in its equipment hurt gross profit by around 5%. An earthquake four years ago sliced operating income by about 7%. The biggest mid-quarter guidance cut I could find is the 25% hit to operating profit that it took in December 2008 as the financial crisis brought the world economy to a halt.To be sure, it’s not certain that a cut will be necessary this time. Clients may decide that they want to keep building up inventory of the chips that come out of TSMC’s factories. But at some point, end-demand may dictate a more cautious approach to procurement. This epidemic is proving hard to quantify, so TSMC’s biggest challenge may not be whether to revise guidance, but what new number to give. To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

On Feb. 13, it said the virus had cut its forecast by $100 million. That’s only around 3% of expected revenue for the quarter, but it all eventually adds up. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., not a direct customer, forecast a decline in revenue from its core businesses as consumers on its e-commerce platform shy away from spending. At least some of those lost sales will be electronics products, which use chips made by TSMC.Chinese companies, including Huawei Technologies Co., accounted for 20% of TSMC’s revenue last year. With numerous enterprises in China on lockdown, adding to the squeeze on both demand and production, it’s unlikely such clients will be able to escape the impact.And last week, wireless industry association GSMA scrapped its annual Mobile World Congress scheduled for Feb. 24 in Barcelona because most of its major participants had already pulled out. This isn’t a consumer event, but the cancellation shows the breadth and reach of the outbreak’s impact on business. Whichever way you look at it, the global tech slowdown leads back to TSMC. Revising guidance mid-quarter isn’t without precedent, and TSMC usually does with a statement filed mid-afternoon Taipei time. It did so a year ago this week, cutting its sales and profit outlook after facing troubles with chemicals used in the manufacturing process. The result was a 10% reduction in operating profit. Just a few months before that, a production hiccup caused by a computer virus in its equipment hurt gross profit by around 5%. An earthquake four years ago sliced operating income by about 7%. The biggest mid-quarter guidance cut I could find is the 25% hit to operating profit that it took in December 2008 as the financial crisis brought the world economy to a halt.To be sure, it’s not certain that a cut will be necessary this time. Clients may decide that they want to keep building up inventory of the chips that come out of TSMC’s factories. But at some point, end-demand may dictate a more cautious approach to procurement. This epidemic is proving hard to quantify, so TSMC’s biggest challenge may not be whether to revise guidance, but what new number to give. To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-02-14	2020-02-14 17:56:23	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	STMicroelectronics Waiting on the IoT	After weathering the chip slump, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) is set up to be a leader in the Internet of Things.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The Internet of Things combines sensors, analysis software and communications. It brings previously inanimate devices under computer control.Self-driving cars are the best-known IoT niche. STM lists Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Mobileye unit among its top 10 customers. But traffic lights, sewers, phone networks, and even biological processes, can be constantly monitored and controlled using STM microcontrollers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Exciting Stocks to Buy for Aggressive Investors A poor first half of 2019 at STM was followed by a strong second half. This sent the shares up 85% over the last six months. At its Feb. 14 opening price of $31.29 per share, STM has a market cap of $28.5 billion against revenues of about $9.5 billion. Its price to earnings ratio of 28 is close to that of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). STM Business and EarningsA valuation like that of TSM makes sense because STM both designs and makes its own chips. Many are made using obscure processes like Fully Depleted Silicon on Insulator (FD-SOI), Radio Frequency Silicon on Insulator (RF-SOI) and Vertical Intelligent Power (VIPower).For its fourth quarter, announced in January, STM beat analyst estimates with earnings of $392 million, 43 cents per share fully diluted, and revenue of $2.75 billion. Management is projecting 2020 revenues of $12 billion and what it calls &quot;solid, sustainable growth.&quot;Most people have never heard of STM because its brand name is hidden inside other companies' products. Its chips go into sub-assemblies, programmed to collect data and communicate it over fixed or variable distances. Still, the company claims about 18,500 patents and filed for 590 more last year.One example of what STM does is its new LoRA SOC. This enables long-range transmission of data for creating smart devices that are managed remotely. The company manufactures in both France and Italy, as well as Singapore, with assembly and testing facilities in Asia and Morocco. Waiting for the PunchI began writing about IoT technology in the early 2000s, calling it the &quot;World of Always On.&quot; I now prefer to call it &quot;the Machine Internet,&quot; and it's a focus for growth in the new decade. Growth has been slowed by a lack of standards, by questions of security, and by privacy worries. STM works, with groups like the Zigbee Alliance on standards aimed at making microcontroller communication invisible.Some of the technical hurdles are now being crossed and niches like self-driving cars are heating up. Analysts expect STM to earn $1.45 per share this year, compared with $1.14 per share last year. Zacks recently profiled it as &quot;an incredible growth stock,&quot;  because earnings estimates have been steadily rising. The Bottom LineThe biggest risks for STM stock right now would be a manufacturing slowdown caused by the coronavirus and growing international tension slowing trade.If that happens, bigger profits will be delayed, but only for a time. The productivity benefits from radio-controlled sensors are impossible to deny. STM also has over $2.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet to weather any storm, against long term debt of $1.9 billion. That's a strong capital position for a manufacturer.A big year for STM will also mean a big year for its customers, and thus for the global economy. Products that sense and manage their own condition can be fixed before they break. They're managed remotely and increase productivity.For people who grew up at the dawn of the computer age, what STM products allow may be indistinguishable from magic. But your grandkids take it for granted.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

2020-02-12	2020-02-12 21:14:45	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Applied Materials Gives Bullish Outlook on Chip Industry Uptick	(Bloomberg) -- Applied Materials Inc. gave a bullish sales forecast for the current quarter suggesting its chipmaker customers have returned to spending more on their factories.The Santa Clara, California-based company is the largest maker of machinery used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are among the most important parts of the electronics supply chain. Its customers include Samsung Electronics Co., Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. That makes Applied Materials’ results and forecasts important early indicators of future demand in the electronics industry.Key InsightsFiscal second-quarter sales will be $4.34 billion, plus or minus $200 million, Applied Materials said Wednesday in a statement. That compares with analysts’ average estimate of $4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Adjusted earnings will be 98 cents a share to $1.10 a share in the period ending in April, the company said. Analysts projected 92 cents.“We believe we can deliver strong double-digit growth in our semiconductor business this year as our unique solutions accelerate our customers’ success in the AI-Big Data era,” Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said in the statement.Chip-equipment makers often experience wild earnings swings. Machines cost tens of millions of dollars each. Delaying factory build outs is one of the fastest ways a chipmaker can preserve cash when they’re unsure of future demand.Net income was $892 million, or 96 cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter, compared with $771 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier.Revenue gained 11% to $4.16 billion in the period ended Jan. 26, making it the first quarter of year-over-year growth in five quarters. Analysts were looking for $4.11 billion.Stock ReactionShares rose about 1% in extended trading after the announcement. The stock closed at $65.37 in New York and has increased 60% over the last 12 months.More InformationFor more details, click here.To see the statement, click here.To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alistair Barr at abarr18@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applied-materials-gives-bullish-outlook-211445596.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-02-07	2020-02-07 12:40:51	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	This Is the Beginning of Another Great Run for Intel Stock	Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) looks poised to outperform going forward, driven by multiple, strong, positive trends. Specifically, Intel stock is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of the cloud, data usage, AI and 5G.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com On the competition front, Intel will benefit from the apparent closing of the gaps between its products and those of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Moreover, the valuation of Intel stock should rise closer to that of AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).Encouragingly, Intel's Q4 data center revenue reachedan all-time record of $7.2 billion last quarter, versus analysts' average outlook of $5.4 billion. The unit's top line jumped 19% YoY, driven by strong demand from cloud infrastructure companies. Intel's revenue from cloud infrastructure vendors soared 48% YoY, Intel CFO George Davis told Reuters. Intel's overall results easily beat analysts' average outlook.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, Intel's chips are proving to be popular with developers of AI systems.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy That Offer Juicy Dividends &quot;Demand for our Intel Xeon scalable processors is very strong as customers continue to make Xeon the foundation for their AI infused data center workloads,&quot; Intel CEO Bob Swan said on the company's fourth-quarter results conference call last month. &quot;One of the reasons Cascade Lake is our fastest ramping Xeon (computer processing unit) is its unrivaled AI performance,&quot; he added.Data centers are &quot;increasingly are running AI algorithms to analyze data to, for instance, identify customer trends that otherwise might be too hard to spot,&quot; Dow Jones reported in December.Swan added that the company will launch new Cooper Lake chips in the first half of this year. The new chips will enable AI systems to be trained up to 60% faster than their predecessors, he stated. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is one of the companies reportedly using Intel's chips for AI. It sounds like Intel will continue to win a lot of deals from AI users. A Closer Look at Intel StockPotentially making Intel even stronger in the AI arena, the company in December bought Israel-based Habana Labs for about $2 billion. A maker of AI chips, Habana will &quot;(help) advance our AI offerings for the data center with high-performance training and inference processors and a standards-based programming environment to address evolving AI workload, &quot; Swan said.The company has stated that it expects data centers' demand for AI chips to reach nearly $12.5 billion in 2024. Intel's 2019 revenue from its AI-based products came in at $3.8 billion, so the company can likely meaningfully increase its AI revenue over the next few years.Swan identified Chinese eCommerce giant  Alibaba (NASDAQ: BABA) as one of Intel's 5G customers. Closing the Gap With AMDIntel plans to release nine new 10-nanometer chips this year, including a mobile CPU, a 5G chip, an AI accelerator, and a Xeon chip for servers, data storage and networking. That should help INTC close the gap with AMD, as TheStreet noted that 10-nanometer chips are &quot;competitive with the 7nm Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) node used for AMD's latest PC and server CPUs.&quot;TheStreet also reported that Intel is growing rapidly in areas where AMD &quot;either doesn't compete or has a very limited presence, including &quot;storage and network processors, Ethernet chips, vision processors for driver-assistance systems and server CPUs for telco networks and IoT/edge computing deployments.&quot;Moreover, Intel is expected to announce new  Xeon Scalable server processors for servers that will include more cores than its previous offering.After launching the new processors, Intel will &quot;do a better job of spec matching against AMD's [processors],&quot; CRN quoted Marc Fertik, vice president of technology solutions at Ace Computers, an Intel partner, as saying.Similarly, the company last month unveiled its new 10-nanometer Tiger Lake processors that will offer &quot;better graphics performance and increased use of artificial intelligence to handle processing workloads.&quot;Additionally, Intel stated that the processors' performance will be at least 10% better than its predecessor. And importantly, TechRadar recently reported that Intel's upcoming flagship Core i9-10900K chip for desktop processors  &quot;handily beats&quot; AMD's competing Ryzen 9 3900X chip in terms of speed.According to PCGames, the performance of Intel's new chip will be about 15%-16% better than its predecessor.Intel has been cutting prices on a number of its products that compete with AMD's offerings. For example, INTC lowered the price of its Core i9 chips for desktops by 40%-50%, and it cut the price of its L-series Cascade Lake Xeon chips for servers by over $4,700.I think the company's strategy is to lower the margins of its products that compete with those of AMD. At the same time, it will look to keep its overall margins at least stable by selling more high-margin products in the segments in which AMD is not competing.Finally, recent data on AMD's share of the desktop market presented by tomsHardware appears to be upbeat for Intel stock. During each of the last three quarters of 2019, AMD's share rose 0 percentage points, 0.9 percentage points, and 0.3 percentage points, according to the data.During that time, the company's market share rose by just 1.2 percentage points. By contrast, over the three quarters that ended in the first quarter of 2019, its market share jumped by 4.1 percentage points. The data indicates that AMD's market share gains have slowed meaningfully to a level that will not hurt Intel very much. The Bottom Line on Intel StockThe forward price-earnings ratio of Intel is only 13.4, versus 31.75 for AMD and 34.5 for Nvidia, respectively. I believe that as Intel's growth accelerates due to its increased penetration of the AI and 5G markets, while it performs better against AMD, its 2020 guidance for roughly 2% revenue growth will prove to be extremely conservative.Consequently, the multiple of Intel stock will move closer to the levels of AMD and NVDA, enabling INTC to handily outperform the market.As of this writing, the author did not own the stocks of any of the aforementioned companies.

2020-02-03	2020-02-03 22:50:27	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Alphabet Cracks the Lid on a Black Box That’s Still Too Opaque	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Let me start by saying that I am new to writing about Alphabet Inc. I’m usually based in Asia, where I write about Foxconn Technology Group, Samsung Electronics Corp. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., among others.These are huge companies that lead their sectors and have different levels of transparency. When I started preparing to cover U.S. technology giants, I figured that the high standards of earnings disclosure at the center of global capitalism would make life a little easier.Then I started looking at Alphabet Inc., which on Monday reported revenue that missed some estimates. It beggars belief that for more than a decade analysts, investors and traders were forced to navigate blind through the black box that was its earnings report.Then came Monday’s announcement.For the first time, executives deigned to tell investors just how much revenue comes from YouTube ($15.1 billion) and from its cloud business ($8.9 billion). It feels like a revelation, as though we’ve been let in on a secret. But when you live in a dark cave, even candlelight can seem bright.While I welcome this move toward transparency, it feels more like a company trying to pacify investors rather than truly inform them. It’s long overdue, but the company can do even more.Before the fourth-quarter earnings announcement, Alphabet broke down advertising revenue only by properties, by network members’ properties, other revenue and other bets. By region, investors are given EMEA, APAC, U.S. and Other Americas. And it shares traffic acquisition costs. Now it’s added two more line items: YouTube, the world’s most ubiquitous video-sharing platform, and Cloud — a hot business that competes against Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and dozens of others.Despite this additional information, I still don’t think investors truly have an understanding of exactly where this company gets its revenue, what divisions make and burn money, and which platforms are lucrative and which are loss leaders (or just losers).Google search and other advertising accounted for 61% of sales last year; that’s a very big pie that could certainly by sliced up further. It doesn’t feel like a coincidence that the two extra divisions it’s breaking out are the ones that grew the fastest last year.Still lacking is any clarity on the product that gives directions to more people than anyone else (Google Maps), the one that has become one of the most pervasive email services (Gmail) nor the operating system that’s in the hands of literally billions of people across the planet (Android). I don’t own shares in Alphabet or any company I cover. But as an investor, I’d want to understand just how Google monetizes the Android operating system and whether that’s improving or deteriorating in tandem with the spread of smartphones globally. I’d also like to know whether Maps and Gmail are winners or loss leaders. Of course, it would be fascinating to know how that $1 billion HTC Corp. acquisition is faring, given that it’s meant to be a springboard into hardware devices that pit Google against its own Android partners.I guess Alphabet just lumps all this in with Google search or “Other.” Investors are right to want more information.And it’s not some esoteric pondering. There’s evidence to suggest that disclosure truly matters. For example, a study by Stanford University accounting professor Mary Barth and her co-authors found that “firms with more transparent earnings enjoy a lower cost of capital.” And Professor Robert G. Eccles of the University of Oxford and previously of Harvard Business School has written numerous papers discussing transparency from different angles, including the conclusion that the U.S. ranks low in terms of quality of disclosure.Amazon.com Inc. is an example of a company that’s improving. Its disclosures, in my opinion, have become more enlightening over the years to the point that observers can analyze multiple slices of the business to get a sense of which units are more profitable, which are growing, and where it’s making money. Investors can see, for example, that its overseas business is a loser and physical retail shrank. Yet those facts didn’t stop its market value from surpassing $1 trillion last week. Amazon still falls a little short, though.For a gold standard in transparency, let me offer up Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which trades in New York and Taipei. Despite being a $270 billion company entrusted with the secrets of the world’s most important technology clients, the chipmaker offers so much information about how it operates that you could almost replicate its business model. It may be worth noting that both TSMC and Amazon provided better risk-adjusted returns over the five years to Dec. 31 than Alphabet, though remember that correlation doesn’t equal causality.So while I applaud Alphabet on these latest disclosures, there’s no doubt that the world’s biggest search engine has a whole lot more to share.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-01-30	2020-01-30 06:53:56	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Samsung Profit Slides 38% With Stubborn Memory-Chip Slump	(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. reported a 38% decline in profit due to falling memory chip prices, a warning sign for the global technology industry as it navigates trade tensions and the coronavirus outbreak.Net income tumbled to 5.23 trillion won ($4.4 billion) for the three months ended December, compared with the 5.31 trillion won average of projections. The miss is a surprise because Samsung carefully orchestrates earnings, including reporting preliminary numbers a few weeks before final results. The early numbers this month beat analyst estimates.Samsung has been struggling with a stubborn slump in the memory chip business, historically its most profitable division, and said the weakness may affect first quarter results. The company also flagged soft demand in the display business for some premium mobile screens and a bigger loss on large displays because of sliding LCD prices.“There are too many factors that need to be considered to conclude that we have entered into a definite demand upcycle,” said Jinman Han, senior vice president of the semiconductor business at Samsung, highlighting macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that may have a negative impact in the future.The coronavirus that began in China has closed stores and factories in the country, the manufacturing base for much of the tech industry. Several companies, including Apple Inc., have said they are uncertain how the outbreak will affect them.Samsung shares fell 3.2% in Seoul. They had increased 5.9% this year through Wednesday, after rising about 44% in 2019. Operating profit was 7.16 trillion won on sales of 59.9 trillion won, the company said, in line with preliminary numbers released earlier this month.​Apple, a rival and customer, reported strong earnings this week, sending shares to a record in U.S. trading. A surge in iPhone sales pushed the Cupertino, Calif.-based company into an approximate tie with Samsung for smartphone shipments in the fourth quarter, according to market researchers.Earlier this month, chip giants Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp. provided bullish outlooks for 2020, driven by demand for cloud-computing centers and fifth-generation smartphones.Samsung, SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. together control more than 90% of the market for dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips, used in everything from data servers to smartphones. Spot prices of DRAM and NAND started increasing in December after getting hammered for a year amid rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China as well as plateauing smartphone sales.​The chip industry has been anticipating a recovery as the roll-out of fifth-generation wireless technology spurs higher demand for memory and greater speeds to process data. Samsung did say there are signs of recovering demand from data center customers and wireless operators.Contract prices for 32-gigabyte DRAM server modules fell about 5.9% in the December quarter, narrower than the 14% slide of the September quarter, according to InSpectrum Tech Inc. Prices for 128-Gb MLC NAND flash memory chips held steady in the final three months of 2019.“Memory-chip suppliers still have a high level of inventories,” said Lee Joo-wan, research fellow at Hana Institute of Finance. “As the first half of the year is off-season, it may take time for recovering prices to be reflected in the performance of suppliers.”Samsung’s smartphone division had a stronger quarter, posting 2.52 trillion won in operating income, up from 1.51 trillion won a year earlier. Although the total shipments of smartphones slightly decreased, high-end devices such as the Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy Fold boosted profits in the fourth quarter.The average selling price of Samsung handsets and tablets was $216 in 4Q, which the company forecasts will increase this quarter as it launches new flagship and premium models. Samsung’s new clamshell-type foldable phone, which will be unveiled Feb. 11, is expected to further fuel growth, said Greg Roh, senior vice president at HMC Securities.Samsung’s operating profit from its display business was about 220 billion won, down from about 970 billion won a year earlier. The company is investing heavily in flexible organic light-emitting diode panels, upgrading its technology to ward off rising competition from Chinese suppliers such as BOE Technology Group Co.The consumer electronics unit, which includes TVs and appliances, had operating profit of about 810 billion won.(Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Sohee Kim in Seoul at skim847@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Peter Elstrom, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-misses-estimates-memory-chip-235402290.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-01-30	2020-01-30 03:02:42	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Samsung Fails to Deliver the Expected Sunshine	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Samsung Electronics Co.’s earnings report and outlook reflect doom and gloom. Many are surprised. Positive signs from chip rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and smartphone stalwart Apple Inc. had fed the belief that the South Korean giant would put the worst behind it. The key takeaway here is that a rising tide doesn’t lift all boats.On the surface, as the one of the world’s biggest technology companies, it might be reasonable to suggest that Samsung ought to benefit from the turnaround enjoyed by major rivals.  In reality, a major reason why Samsung is suffering while others rebound is that the company’s big strengths — memory chips and displays — are precisely the weakest parts of the tech sector right now.Its semiconductor unit posted a 56% drop in operating income for the period and its display business fell 77%. Between them, these component divisions usually contribute half to two-thirds of its profit. TSMC, Intel Corp. and even Advanced Micro Devices Inc. don’t dabble in such commodity products. When things are good in memory and displays, Samsung soars because it’s the world’s largest supplier of both. But when times are bad, like now, it suffers the most. That pain will continue in both divisions this quarter, with executives noting in a conference call that continued weakness in demand will hurt both revenue and profits.Bulls will find positive signs if they want. The memory chip market will surely improve as the year progresses, but heck, it couldn’t get much worse. And the whole world — from TSMC to Intel to Xiaomi Corp. — is betting that a 5G rollout will juice sales across the board. Just because TSMC, Apple and Intel reported solid results and gave optimistic outlooks doesn’t mean that every company in the sector is set to benefit from a turnaround in hardware. AMD, Intel’s chief competitor in computer chips, provided guidance just a day earlier that could be characterized as a bit light. Its shares fell 6%, their largest decline since August.Samsung’s 1.5% miss on net income was a break from the previous two quarters, when it surpassed analyst estimates. We already knew sales and operating figures from preliminary results provided earlier this month that hinted that things had reached a bottom and pointed to positive signs ahead. Operating income fell 34%, but was better than estimates, which makes this weak net profit figure confounding.The only division that didn’t share the pain is smartphones, a sandbox that Apple also plays in. Operating profit from that division climbed 67% from a year prior. But Samsung noted that the figure will remain only “steady” this quarter since an expected revenue boost from new models, including a foldable handset, will be offset by higher marketing costs. In the end, it may be best to look at reality. Samsung has chosen a strategy that allows it to dominate a select part of the tech industry. Unfortunately, that means feeling the most pain when such a bet doesn’t pay off.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-01-24	2020-01-24 14:10:05	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Can’t Take Off Another Round in Chip Battle	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Intel Inc. closed out 2019 learning the hard lesson that making cutting-edge semiconductors is truly difficult.Like a prizefighter who refuses to admit he just hit the mat, the world’s biggest chipmaker is coming out swinging. And it should, because how it gets through 2020 could decide the company’s fate. Once the most advanced supplier of semiconductors, Intel struggled last year to ramp up production of chips that use its latest 14-nanometer process node, “letting customers down,” as CEO Bob Swan said in October. Its full-year results released Thursday showed that revenue climbed 2% and that net income was flat — hiding the fact that Intel dodged a bullet when it wasn’t able to supply enough of its most advanced products when clients needed them most.It tried to offer some reassurance three months ago by noting that it would increase 14-nanometer capacity 25% this year while raising capital spending to nose-bleed levels. To help overcome that slip-up, executives are keen to tell investors how many customers have signed up for its latest offerings, including a chip dubbed Ice Lake and an upgrade to its Comet Lake mobile processor, which use the next-generation 10-nanometer process. In reality, Intel is badly lagging behind both contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. TSMC, for example, started selling its 10-nanometer chip technology in mid-2017 and last year boosted revenue from its more advanced 7-nanometer offerings by more than 200%. When Intel eventually hits 7 nanometers in 2021, it will be almost three years behind.Intel’s rebuttal is that so-called process-node technology isn’t the only thing. It’s right, and clients should look at total system performance to see how all the parts — the processor, memory and controllers — all slot together. No other company in the world can offer the breadth and depth that Intel can.But with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. back in the game after a decade in the wilderness and a raft of chip designers ready to tap TSMC’s technology advantage, Intel would be foolish to rest on the belief that it can stay ahead of the game while lagging behind on technology. It knows this and has committed to speeding up its migration from the pace of a new node every five to seven quarters to as little as four quarters. Yet investors ought to also note that the introduction of a new node compresses margins during the early stages before better yields provide economies of scale later. A quicker timetable won’t allow as much time to enjoy the upside before the next margin crunch comes.Intel’s strategy to offset this squeeze is to tap continued growth in the data-center market. Cloud providers like Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. are among customers for its 14-nanometer Cascade Lake products, while the global 5G rollout is expected to provide a couple of solid growth years. Its Data Center Group accounts for 32.6% of revenue but 46.4%  of operating income, making it Intel’s most lucrative business unit by operating margin.But that business relies on Intel’s ability to churn out leading-edge chips that, even if not equivalent to what TSMC can offer clients, won’t be too far behind. A data center operator might be willing to forgive a single-generation lag, reasoning that the broader platform integration Intel offers can provide the cost-benefit metrics it needs. A two-generation delay is hard to overlook, though. Intel’s size and strength means it won’t be easily knocked out. But it needs to get through this year unscathed if it’s to remain the undisputed heavyweight champ.(Updates with details about Intel’s 10-nanometer offerings in the fourth paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-01-22	2020-01-22 12:34:56	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	ASML Chief Dismisses U.S., China Tensions as a Headache	(Bloomberg) -- ASML Holding NV’s top executive brushed off concerns about tensions between the U.S. and China, a market that’s growing in importance to the Dutch chip gear-maker.“Someone needs to make those chips and to make those chips you would need EUV, and there is basically only one place where they can get it,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio, referring to its advanced lithography equipment. “For our total business it doesn’t really matter.“ASML, which has a monopoly on advanced lithography equipment needed to make next-generation chips, is already a crucial supplier to Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. but hopes to drive deeper into China. Beijing wants to build a world-class homegrown chip industry to wean itself off foreign imports -- an effort that would need ASML’s one-of-a-kind machines. Yet it’s faced difficulty getting the Dutch government to renew a license to export to China amid ongoing trade tensions.ASML shares rose 0.2% at 1:14 p.m. in Amsterdam trading.“It’s up to the Dutch government to determine whether there is a national security risk and of course there are views in the U.S. and China whether that’s a risk,” Wennink said, adding that the company has responded to requests for information from the Dutch government.Asked whether he was optimistic about obtaining the license, Wennink said “the Dutch government takes very due care when it concerns the facts and the circumstances.”Read more: China Stockpiles U.S. Chips as ‘Silicon Curtain’ DescendsChina relies on imported chip manufacturing equipment for its audacious ambition of creating a self-reliant semiconductor industry, which supplies key components for a wide spectrum of electronics from smartphones to satellites. ASML is an essential link in that plan, which will drive Chinese purchases of more than $30 billion of semiconductor equipment between 2020 and 2021, according to industry organization SEMI. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement last week the Netherlands should make an objective decision on ASML’s exports based on its own interests.U.S. PressureEuropean businesses have been caught in the middle of trade tensions between the U.S. and China, even as Washington and Beijing last week sealed the first phase of a trade deal. But the U.S. still maintains tariffs on roughly two-thirds of imports from China and both sides still need to negotiate the pact’s second phase, with discussions expected to be difficult.U.S. officials have urged allies to scrutinize business ties with Beijing, invoking concerns around national security and espionage. The White House, concerned about China’s ambitions to dominate a swath of technology from AI to semiconductors, has sought ways to contain the country’s rise. China, meanwhile, has threatened European countries with retaliation on trade if its companies are shunned.European telecom operators are among those squeezed between the two major world powers after Washington called on European governments to exclude Huawei Technologies Co.’s equipment from the build-out of their 5G networks.The Dutch government has held back on renewing the license ASML needs to export its extreme ultraviolet lithography machines under pressure from U.S. officials, Reuters reported this month. That equipment is key to any chipmaker that wants to fabricate next-generation chips, say of 7 nanometer or lower nodes.Last week, U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands Pete Hoekstra told Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad that ASML’s technology “doesn’t belong in certain places,” suggesting China. The Chinese ambassador, Xu Hong, had warned days earlier in the same paper that the relationship between the Netherlands and China was at risk if the government blocks EUV machine exports.For its part, the Netherlands says it will take its own decision on the matter, independent of foreign influence. “They are free to express their view and we take note of that, but it is not decisive,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said of the U.S. and Chinese ambassadors’ comments last week.ASML’s EUV technology has both civilian and military applications and therefore is subject to EU dual-use licensing obligations under the Wassenaar Arrangement, according to the Dutch Foreign Ministry.EUV LicenseWennink said at a press conference the Dutch government had asked the company questions about the EUV technology, how it works, and who the customer is. The level of detail the government is seeking “is probably more than they would normally do,” he said.The delay in getting the EUV license has “zero” impact on the company’s business, he said. The licensing issue concerns their first-ever EUV order from a customer in China, where few companies are at the stage of ordering the cutting-edge technology. ASML mostly ships the machines, which cost roughly 150 million euros, to the U.S., Korea and Taiwan.The company forecast first-quarter sales largely in line with analyst expectations and said it won orders for nine more of its EUV lithography machines in the last quarter. The Dutch company said it expects sales of 3.1 billion euros ($3.4 billion) to 3.3 billion euros for the first quarter, compared with an average estimate of 3.26 billion euros.ASML also announced a share buy-back program of as much as 6 billion euros over three years, as it said it expects to win 4.5 billion euros in EUV revenue this year.(Updates with CEO comments from the 15th paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Joost Akkermans and Gao Yuan.To contact the reporters on this story: Ellen Proper in Amsterdam at eproper@bloomberg.net;Natalia Drozdiak in Brussels at ndrozdiak1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Amy ThomsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asml-ceo-dismisses-u-china-075820550.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-01-22	2020-01-22 06:23:34	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	New Low-Cost iPhone to Enter Mass Production in February	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. suppliers plan to begin assembling a new low-cost iPhone in February, people familiar with the plan said, as the company looks to address a wider swath of the global smartphone market ahead of its 5G handsets later this year.The Cupertino, California-based company is expected to officially unveil the new phone as early as March, one person familiar with its road map said. The assembly work for the new handset will be split among Hon Hai Precision Industry, Pegatron Corp. and Wistron Corp., the people added.This will be the first lower-cost iPhone model since the iPhone SE. It will look similar to the iPhone 8 from 2017 and include a 4.7-inch screen, Bloomberg News has previously reported. The iPhone 8 is still on the market, currently selling for $449, whereas Apple sold the iPhone SE for $399 when that handset launched in 2016.The new phone is expected to have Touch ID built into the home button, reusing established Apple technology instead of opting for an in-display fingerprint sensor like most modern Android rivals. It will not have Apple’s Face ID biometric authentication, but it will feature the same processor as Apple’s current flagship device, the iPhone 11.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Apple Expects IPhone Shipments to Return to Growth in 2020Apple’s more affordable iPhones have proven popular with consumers, including the latest iPhone 11, whose starting price was $50 lower than Apple’s typical pricing. Strong demand for iPhones has prompted Apple to ask Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to make more chips in the current quarter, according to two people familiar with the matter.Shares in Japan Display Inc., which supplies LCD screens for Apple’s lower-tier iPhones, closed 1.35% higher on Wednesday.Apple is planning a slew of new high-end iPhones for release later in 2020 that include 5G connectivity, faster processors, and new 3-D cameras on the back, Bloomberg News has reported.A cheaper offering may help Apple better compete in the most price-competitive and fast-growing emerging phone markets, particularly India. iPhones are still a hard sell in the country, which is overrun by aggressively-priced Android rivals coming in at less than $200. Still, Apple has shown a will to carve out a niche for itself and is eyeing locations for Apple stores within its borders.The U.S. tech juggernaut is hoping its handset shipments will return to growth this year, having set itself the goal of shipping more than 200 million units in 2020. The successor to the iPhone SE will play a significant role in that task.(Updates with Japan Display share price move)To contact the reporters on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.net;Mark Gurman in Los Angeles at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/low-cost-iphones-enter-mass-235234201.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-01-22	2020-01-22 01:00:33	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Is Raising TSMC Chip Orders to Meet Strong iPhone Demand	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has asked chipmaking partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to increase its output of A-series processors this quarter in order to satisfy higher-than-anticipated iPhone demand, people familiar with the company’s plans said.The iPhone 11 and 11 Pro models were well received on their debut in the fall and their sales in China have been particularly strong, outselling 2018’s releases in a market that has otherwise been shrinking. Even without fifth-generation wireless networking, iPhone demand has been outperforming the market and Apple’s expectations, and the company asked assembly partners to increase their production of the latest generation.The most affordable iPhone 11 model, equipped with an LCD screen, was a particular driver for the increased demand, one person said.New Low-Cost IPhone Said to Enter Mass Production in FebruaryAlong with the popularity of existing models, Apple’s business with TSMC is also set for a boost from an imminent iPhone SE successor, a low-cost model that will begin mass production in February ahead of an official unveiling as soon as March, Bloomberg News reported. It will be built around the same processor as the iPhone 11 generation.TSMC spokeswoman Nina Kao said the company doesn’t comment on its business with any specific customer. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The Taiwanese chipmaker recently reported earnings above most analysts’ expectations and it forecast another good quarter ahead. Though it faces potential headwinds from the threat of tightening U.S. sanctions on key customer Huawei Technologies Co., analysts believe additional demand from Apple and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. will replace any potential Huawei drop-off.&#92;--With assistance from Mark Gurman.To contact the reporter on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-raising-tsmc-chip-orders-010033688.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-16	2020-01-16 21:27:57	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	5 Top Stock Trades for Friday: SIG, MSFT, TNDM	Stocks continue to push higher, with major U.S. indices hitting more record highs on Thursday. That being said, here's a look at a few top stock trades for Friday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Signet Jewelers (SIG)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comThere's a short squeeze alert in Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG). The stock is more than 40% on Thursday on better-than-expected earnings. With a short interest of 32% and needing more than seven days to fully cover, this one has squeeze written all over it.Signet isn't the only short squeeze out there, it's just the latest to do so. The stock erupted out of its short-term channel (blue lines) and over the $27.50 level. I would love to see the latter hold as support in the event of a pullback.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSpeaking of which, that will be on investors' minds if SIG stock fails to reclaim the 100-week moving average currently near $32. Above that, and the $34 to $35 area will be the next upside target. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Microsoft (MSFT)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comThis slow-and-steady juggernaut just keeps grinding higher, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) hitting another new high on Thursday.I think the best thing investors can ask for now is some gentle consolidation. Similar to what we saw from July through October, when Microsoft chopped between the $130-$140 range as the stock digested its big gains from the previous six months.For now, shares are in an uptrend, with the 20-day moving average acting as support. Dips to this mark can be bought, until the trend fails. Once that happens -- not if -- then investors can start turning more cautious on the name, and keep an eye out for a potential pullback or consolidation phase. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Tandem Diabetes Care (TNDM)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comTandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ:TNDM) shares were moving higher on Thursday. And while the charts are setting up nicely, overhead resistance looms large.The stock continues to put in a series of higher lows, and is over all of its major moving averages. However, the $72 level has been stiff resistance, while $74 hasn't been much kinder. A breakout over the former likely sends it to the latter, but a breakout over both would be more ideal.It could happen on the next test, but TNDM's breakout may be more sustainable if it rallies up to this level, pulls back into support and tries again after making another higher low. Either way, keep both support and resistance on watch. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: InMode (INMD)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comInMode (NASDAQ:INMD) shares jumped higher on Thursday, creating an interesting setup. A week ago, INMD stock broke out over downtrend resistance, but has been finding resistance at $45 as of late.For now, the 20-day moving average is acting as support, while the 50-day moving average has been mixed. Some days it has been support, others days it has drawn in sellers.However, that's not the focus. Instead, watch $45. Over this mark puts this week's high on the table, at $45.95. Over that, and $50 isn't out of the question for INMD. Below the 20-day moving average, and the backside of prior downtrend resistance is on watch. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is essentially flat on Thursday, despite initially rallying on earnings. Now, the stock is setting up in a rather tight trading range.Shares are struggling with the $60 level and uptrend resistance (blue line). On the plus side, the 20-day moving average has been acting as support, while longer-term uptrend support (purple line) remains in play.Below support, and the $57 gap-up support mark is in play with the 50-day moving average just below. If the 50-day fails as support, TSM will need more time to reset.

2020-01-16	2020-01-16 10:35:22	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	The $150 Million Machine With $200 Billion at Stake for China	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Huawei Technologies Co. has become very much the U.S.’s whipping boy in the battle to nip China’s technological ascendancy in the bud. President Donald Trump’s administration has slapped sanctions and curbs on the Shenzhen-based company and lobbied allies to do the same. Last month growing resistance against Huawei among lawmakers in Germany’s governing coalition sparked threats of retaliation from the Chinese ambassador. But what’s happening next door in the Netherlands has higher stakes for China. There, Beijing’s envoy this week said there will be negative consequences if the Dutch continue to block the export of a single piece of high-tech manufacturing equipment made by ASML Holding NV. According to Reuters, the U.S. has exerted pressure to prevent the sale to a Chinese firm. But it’s not just any machine. It’s a $150 million state-of-the-art apparatus that could ensure Moore’s Law — which says that processing power doubles every 18 months — continues apace, and the microchips powering our smartphones, computers and networks get ever smaller.Like with Huawei, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited intelligence concerns, though Reuters didn’t specify what they are. The Hague subsequently rescinded an export license it had previously granted for the machine.Any individual nation state cutting Huawei, the world’s largest networking business, out of the supply chain for its 5G networks will of course be a blow to the Chinese firm. But the impact on China as a whole will be limited. Beijing will still be able to build its own next-generation telecommunication networks, and losing a few exports will have a minor effect on the economy as a whole. Huawei’s sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa totaled $31 billion in 2018.A ban on buying machines from ASML is potentially far more significant, because it will hinder China’s ambitious goals to strengthen its super high-tech manufacturing industry.As far as tech giants go, ASML doesn’t have the global brand cachet of an Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. or Amazon.com Inc. That’s partly because its products are two steps removed from the electronic devices that reside in consumers’ pockets, on their desktops or in their living rooms: ASML builds the machines that make the semiconductors that go into their devices. But it’s one of Europe’s biggest three technology companies, and its top customers include chipmakers Intel Corp., Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which is known as TSMC and makes chips for Apple and Huawei alike.The Dutch firm stands out from rivals Nikon Corp. and Canon Inc. because it’s alone in having mastered an approach known as extreme ultraviolet lithography, which is needed for the manufacture of the next generation of chips. Lithography is the process by which circuit patterns are etched onto silicon wafers, and the EUV process will allow the printing of circuits that are more than 10 times smaller than the current standard.QuicktakeHow Chinese Technology Grew to Rival Silicon ValleySo you can see why China would be particularly interested in using ASML’s equipment. Although the country is a hub of electronics manufacturing, much of that is simply assembling iPhones, laptops, smart speakers and the like. The underlying tech is often imported, including some $200 billion-worth of semiconductors each year.Beijing wants to reduce that dependence on imports by investing $150 billion over a decade in an effort to take the lead in technology design and manufacturing. Access to machines made by ASML will be essential to achieving that. By the end of next year, as much as half of TSMC’s revenue will depend at least partly on some EUV processes, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Masahiro Wakasugi. That could be $18 billion worth of chips. TSMC said on Thursday that its deployment of EUV machines was on schedule, advancing at a similar rate to earlier technologies, as it reported earnings that exceeded analyst expectations.While it could take a decade and more than one EUV machine for Chinese firms such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. to rival that, that is clearly the long-term goal. (SMIC is reportedly the company that placed the order at the heart of the current spat.)Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad reported last year that ASML was the target of theft by a rival with ties to the Chinese state, though the company later said that any “suggestion that we were somehow victim of a national conspiracy is wrong.” Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink surely doesn’t want to lose China’s business: It’s ASML’s fastest-growing market.What makes the Dutch move so remarkable is that the U.S. can only unilaterally block sales abroad if components or R&D contributions originating domestically exceed 25% for the relevant product. Here, it seems to have succeeded in leaning on the Dutch government to prevent the sale even though, according to press reports, ASML’s extreme ultraviolet lithography machine doesn’t meet that test.

The promising outlook from TSMC - a proxy for global tech demand given it has clients like Apple, Qualcomm and Huawei - comes as a strong uptake of 5G smartphones is fuelling an overall recovery in the global smartphone market that has shrunk for the past three years.

2020-01-16	2020-01-16 09:58:19	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Chipmaker TSMC’s Profit Bigger Than Expected	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly revenue well above analysts’ estimates, brushing aside concerns that tighter U.S. sanctions on No. 2 customer Huawei Technologies Co. could dampen its business.Shares in the world’s largest contract chipmaker have slid two straight days on worries that Washington will tighten existing restrictions on exports to Huawei, potentially curtailing shipments from TSMC and other non-American firms. If the U.S. does move ahead, any disruption would be short-term because TSMC could replace some of the lost Huawei business with orders from other customers thanks to the 5G boom, Chairman Mark Liu said during a post-earnings conference with analysts.TSMC has recruited Intel’s former chief lobbyist to gauge the temperature in Washington and lessen any fallout from U.S.-Chinese tensions, including policies involving Huawei.“We are prepared to deal with this export control regulation,” Liu said, adding that if any new controls were introduced, TSMC would carefully “evaluate product by product eligibility of export.”But some analysts judged Liu’s assessment too rosy. TSMC may be over-estimating the ability of other customers to pick up the slack were its Huawei business to be curtailed, Bernstein analyst Mark Li said. “The forecast, according to TSMC, assumes ‘business as usual’. The company sees any disruption will be short-lived and for example commented that smaller telco infrastructure suppliers can quickly pick up the shortfall if Huawei can’t deploy 5G as planned. We find that too optimistic,” Li said.TSMC reported better-than-expected net income of NT$116 billion ($3.9 billion) in the December quarter. Gross margins came in at 50.2%, also exceeding estimates. It forecast revenue of $10.2 billion to $10.3 billion in the March quarter, surpassing estimates for $9.6 billion.Apple Inc.’s main chipmaker is banking that the rollout of fifth-generation enabled smartphones in 2020 will galvanize growth. Semiconductor orders from Huawei account for 10% of its revenue, according to Bloomberg data. TSMC’s robust results demonstrate how the world’s largest contract chipmaker is investing in technology to safeguard its market lead over Samsung Electronics Co. and Intel Corp. TSMC spent almost $15 billion on technology and capacity in 2019 and is prepared to shell out as much as $16 billion this year, anticipating the advent of fifth-generation smartphones. The company, a barometer for the tech industry thanks to its heft and place in the supply chain, has said the advent of 5G will result in more chips in devices than before.Capex growth this year will mainly come from an increase in specialty technology including CMOS sensors -- which turn light into digital signals for smartphone cameras -- and power management chips, and packaging technology, according to Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang.TSMC previously reported record fourth-quarter revenue of NT$317.2 billion. Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei has expressed hopes that the emergence of 5G, the foundation of future technologies from automated factories and smart homes to faster consumer electronics, will underpin its business in coming years.In addition to 5G, TSMC’s counting on growing demand for high-performance computing. Positive comments from Micron Technologies Inc. and Samsung suggest the global semiconductor market is poised for a gradual recovery on the back of demand related to 5G, artificial intelligence and automotive applications.(Updates with details on preparation for Huawei curbs)To contact the reporters on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.net;Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-chipmaker-tsmc-profit-bigger-054229060.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-16	2020-01-16 05:04:19	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Specter of More U.S. Restrictions Weighs on Huawei	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. The so-called phase-one U.S.-China trade pact has done little to allay fears about Huawei Technologies Co.’s prospects and those of its key suppliers, two analyst research reports suggest.Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse warned of the likely trickle-down impact of U.S. sanctions on Huawei should they remain in place or be tightened even further. Restrictions could slow the pace of China’s fifth-generation networking rollout, which would affect Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and fellow technology and manufacturing providers, one report said.Tensions over tech are likely to remain as the Trump administration considers steps to further limit the ability of American companies to supply Huawei. This comes even as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Wednesday he doesn’t “view Huawei as a chess piece” in continuing negotiations with China.Tech Industry Shudders as U.S. Weighs New Limits on Huawei SalesMorgan Stanley analysts forecast Huawei’s total smartphone volume at 200 million this year, a decline of 40 million from 2019. Without regaining access to the Google Mobile Services suite on Android, Huawei’s “smartphone shipments would be close to zero in Western Europe,” said the analysts. That compares to shipments of 29 million units in 2018 and 21 million devices through the first three quarters of 2019 for the region, they added. The European market had served as a catalyst for Huawei’s consumer division, which was itself the biggest growth engine for the Chinese company.Closer controls on Huawei would also impact its key suppliers. Chipmaking giant TSMC, which counts Huawei as its second largest customer after Apple Inc., relies on its semiconductor orders for 10% of revenue, according to Bloomberg data. Credit Suisse wrote that TSMC would lose a chunk of that business in the event of increased sanctions, though the hit would be partially offset by other customers like Apple and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. expanding their orders. TSMC reports earnings later today, hoping to shake off a two-day decline in share price amid added uncertainty about U.S. pressure.Some Asian tech names stand to benefit under new supply chain scenarios, Samsung Electronics Co. most notable among them. It’s expected to soak up the Western Europe smartphone demand that would emerge without competitive Huawei devices on the market, Morgan Stanley said. Credit Suisse echoed the positive sentiment, adding that the Samsung LSI chipmaking division would “benefit supplying the mid-tier Qualcomm chips and Exynos family” in the absence of Huawei from key global markets.Read more: TSMC Hires Ex-Intel Lobbyist to Deal With U.S.-China Tensions&#92;--With assistance from Cindy Wang.To contact the reporter on this story: Vlad Savov in Tokyo at vsavov5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/specter-more-u-restrictions-weighs-050419641.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-14	2020-01-14 06:00:41	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC, Samsung & Why Asia Chipmaker Profits Are Key	(Bloomberg) -- With tech earnings looming this month, investor attention is zeroing in on some of Asia’s largest chipmakers. And there’s reason for it: the sector’s influence on the region’s stocks has kept on growing.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is set to report fourth-quarter results Thursday, potentially hitting record revenue of more than $10.2 billion and its highest quarterly gross margins since 2018, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said in a Jan. 7 preview. TSMC shares are up more than 4% this month and touched an intraday high Tuesday.“Many of TSMC’s customers such as Huawei, Qualcomm and Mediatek are quickening their pace of adopting cutting-edge processes to prepare for the launch of 5G mobile devices,” Shum said in the report.Rival Samsung Electronics Co. releases its final results Jan. 30. Preliminary figures announced earlier this month showed quarterly earnings beat estimates as global chip prices have shown signs of escaping a protracted slump.The two chipmaking behemoths are the No. 3 and 4 largest stocks in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index and also key contributors to the growing influence of technology names in the gauge. The industry now accounts for almost 15% of the regional gauge, up from 12% at the start of 2019. Internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. have the highest weightings in the index.Managers of emerging-market stocks have increased their exposure to semiconductor shares to a record 7.3%, making of it the largest overweight by sector, according to Steven Holden, an analyst at Smartkarma Holdings Pte. Taiwan and South Korean equity overweights also hit a peak, with TSMC among the most favorite companies, it said.Despite all the positives, one potential question mark for TSMC remains Huawei Technologies Co. Tighter export restrictions on the Chinese company by the U.S. would make some of TSMC’s technologies unshippable to Huawei, analysts led by Mark Li at Sanford C. Bernstein wrote in a Jan. 8 note. While the actual impact on revenue is expected to be in the low single digits and TSMC will be able to pivot to other customers, a short-term impact is “inevitable as share shifts and supply-chain realignment take time.”But overall, the outlook for the semiconductor industry is positive on growth drivers including new 5G technology adoption, internet of things momentum, robust data center demand and even new game console launches, Credit Suisse analysts Randy Abrams and Haas Liu said in a Jan. 13 report.“Stocks are recovering from the prior decade’s de-rating and returning to pre-crisis valuations that can sustain,” the analysts said. The main risk? With higher valuations after a strong 2019 rally, any disappointment from product cycle ramps or macro shocks could lead to potential short-term pullbacks, they added.Stock-Market SummaryMSCI Asia Pacific Index up 0.2%Japan's Topix index up 0.3%; Nikkei 225 up 0.7%Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index down 0.3%; Hang Seng China Enterprises down 0.4%; Shanghai Composite down 0.1%; CSI 300 down 0.2%Taiwan's Taiex index up 0.5%South Korea's Kospi index up 0.3%; Kospi 200 up 0.4%Australia's S&P/ASX 200 up 0.8%; New Zealand’s S&P/NZX 50 up 0.7%India's S&P BSE Sensex Index little changed; NSE Nifty 50 little changedSingapore's Straits Times Index up 0.5%; Malaysia’s KLCI down 0.7%; Philippine Stock Exchange Index down 0.5%; Jakarta Composite up 0.2%; Thailand's SET little changed; Vietnam's VN Index up 0.2%S&P 500 e-mini futures little changed after index closed up 0.7% in last session(Adds Smartkarma comments in sixth paragraph, stock-summary section)&#92;--With assistance from Cormac Mullen, Abhishek Vishnoi and Moxy Ying.To contact the reporter on this story: Eric Lam in Hong Kong at elam87@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christopher Anstey at canstey@bloomberg.net, Lianting Tu, Cecile VannucciFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-samsung-why-asia-chipmaker-060041135.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-01-13	2020-01-13 09:19:52	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC Hires Ex-Intel Lobbyist to Deal With U.S.-China Tensions	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a major chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co., has recruited rival Intel Corp.’s former top lobbyist Peter Cleveland to spearhead an unprecedented effort in Washington to mitigate impact from U.S.-Chinese trade tensions.The world’s biggest contract chipmaker joins a growing number of companies with Chinese business interests that are stepping up U.S. lobbying, aiming to gauge and lessen the fallout from Washington’s ongoing dispute with Beijing. The Taiwanese company indicated in July it was considering starting government relations operations in the U.S.Cleveland, who headed Intel’s lobbying effort for over a decade, updated his LinkedIn profile this month to reflect new responsibilities including representing TSMC on policy, legislative and regulatory matters. There’s been speculation U.S. sanctions may affect TSMC’s shipments to Huawei. But the Taiwanese chipmaker has publicly quashed talk of U.S. pressure for it to stop supplying its No. 2 customer, which Washington blacklisted and views as a national security threat.Read more: TSMC to Keep Supplying Huawei, Quashes Talk of U.S. Pressure“Peter Cleveland is helping TSMC enhance communications with stakeholders including government officials at a global level,” TSMC spokeswoman Nina Kao told Bloomberg News by phone, adding Cleveland is based in Washington D.C.While there have been TSMC staffers tasked with similar responsibilities previously, Cleveland’s arrival coalesces the effort under one independent position, according to Kao. TSMC plays an indispensable role in the global semiconductor industry, commanding more than 50% of the global foundry market. U.S. and Chinese tech companies from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to Nvidia Corp. rely on it for the production of their most advanced chips.It joins a wave of companies that in recent months have begun to play a more active role in lobbying Washington. Huawei spent a company-record $1.8 million on federal lobbying in the past quarter as it struggled against U.S. sanctions that deprived it of key components or software from American suppliers like Intel, Xilinx Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. TikTok, the popular music-video app owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Inc., is also expanding its U.S. lobbying operations.Huawei is TSMC’s largest customer after Apple, according to Bloomberg supply chain data, contributing roughly 10% of the chipmaker’s revenue. Cleveland managed 200 attorneys and policy professionals while at Intel, and his areas of expertise include antitrust reviews, 5G spectrum allocations, and global IP enforcement and protection, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before Intel, he served as California Senator Dianne Feinstein’s chief of staff.Read more: Trump’s Blacklisting of Huawei Is Failing to Halt Its Growth&#92;--With assistance from Ian King and Vlad Savov.To contact the reporter on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-hires-ex-intel-lobbyist-091952517.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-01-03	2020-01-03 14:53:26	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Advanced Micro Devices Sets a New High	Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) took out its dot-com era high on Jan. 2 with bulls confidently predicting more gains.Source: Joseph GTK / Shutterstock.com The stock reached $49.10 per share. But the air strike against Iran's military leader was sending all stocks down Jan. 3. AMD was down in pre-market trading, opening this morning at $46.86.At its Jan. 2 closing price, AMD had a market capitalization of $57 billion, on estimated sales of $6.1 billion. But analysts say the party should continue. Rosenblatt Securities has a one-year price target of $65 on the shares.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips New Rival, New DangerMissteps by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) under former CEO Brian Krzanich gave AMD an opening in the 2010s to take the lead in chip technology. Under Lisa Su, AMD has capitalized through a strong alliance with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), whose fabrication plants can deliver chips with lines 7 nanometers apart. Intel is still mastering 10-nanometer technology.TSM's capacity is now fully booked, with AMD set to double production.  * 10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers But there's a new competitive threat. AMD is getting extra 7-nanometer capacity in the second half because Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be using new TSM lines to make chips with lines 5-nanometers apart.The entry of cloud companies into chip-making could scramble the technology board. Hardware is increasingly defined by software, and the enormous financial resources of the big cloud names mean they're taking their place in it. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) all have projects for creating their own fast data center chips.Apple's 5-nanometer chips are expected to go into the next iPhone. Apple has been using 7-nanometer technology since 2018, meaning the current iPhone has more power than most thin laptops. Apple is doing in technology what Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) has done in clothing. It controls both the manufacturing and the retailing, disintermediating the rest of the industry.While AMD was hitting its record high Jan. 2, so was Apple, which closed over $300 per share, a market cap of $1.3 trillion. For those scoring at home, that's over 20 times bigger than AMD. Beating Nvidia?Intel is AMD's traditional rival. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is its newer rival, in graphics chips.While AMD is ahead of Intel, it remains behind Nvidia, but only slightly. Its latest laptop graphics chip, the RX 5600M, will be combined with the Ryzen 4000 &quot;Renoir&quot; to produce gaming computers that are &quot;cost effective&quot; compared with solutions combining Nvidia chips with Intel processors.Thus, AMD Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster remains optimistic. He said the company's &quot;roadmap&quot; for future chips now goes out two generations, or about three years, and the firm has the capacity to sustain that pace of innovation.The confidence from AMD, and the anticipation of tech growth generally, has created some irrational exuberance in the stock, according to Seeking Alpha's Kwan-Chen Ma. Speculators are pricing AMD for perfection. But oceans rise and empires fall, meaning every price is subject to external events. The Bottom LineAMD, and all tech stocks, should expect a hard fall over the next few months, as the world's markets adjust to war-time conditions.A rotation into oil and defense stocks, away from technology and gaming, is going to hit AMD shares hard because they're already priced at nearly 10 times revenue.Despite this, AMD management is controlling what it can control. It has the design teams and the alliances to maintain and even expand share in the areas where it competes. In terms of price for performance, its server chips are still considered bargains.Wait for the shakeout, then consider buying.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2020-01-03	2020-01-03 11:30:23	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Ousted Bitmain Co-Founder Wages Battle for Control in Court	(Bloomberg) -- Ousted Bitmain Technologies Ltd. co-founder Micree Zhan Ketuan has initiated a legal case to try to regain his position, escalating a battle for control of the world’s biggest miner of cryptocurrency.Great Simplicity Investment Corporation, owned by the engineering whiz-turned-entrepreneur, filed a summons in December in which he asked a Cayman Islands court to reverse a shareholder decision that cost him voting control of the crypto-miner. In the summons -- a notice served to defendant Bitmain -- Zhan asked the court to invalidate a vote at a November extraordinary general meeting that curtailed his rights. Shareholders voted then to convert Bitmain’s Class B shares to one vote per share, versus 10 votes previously -- effectively slashing Zhan’s influence, according to the summons obtained by Bloomberg.It’s the latest salvo in a conflict that erupted into the public eye after Bitmain stripped Zhan of his titles in October. Billionaire Chief Executive Officer Wu Jihan is now back in the driver’s seat, hosting public events to tout new sales initiatives and attract clients. He had earlier warned employees against taking further instructions from Zhan or attending any meetings he convenes, threatening staff with dismissal or criminal charges.Zhan, for his part, wrote in a letter published November on his WeChat social media account that he’ll return to Bitmain and “restore order” as soon as possible, legally. “If someone wants war, we’ll give them war,” he posted on his feed. The co-founder held close to 4 million B shares according to a 2018 IPO prospectus, almost double that of Wu, the only other holder of the special stock. It’s unclear whether that balance has shifted since.Nishant Sharma, a Bitmain spokesman, declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Calls and messages to Micree Zhan’s personal mobile went unanswered. A representative for Conyers Dill & Pearman, the attorneys for the plaintiff, didn’t comment when contacted.The internal squabble complicates the prospects of a company grappling with intensifying competition from smaller rivals such as U.S.-listed Canaan Inc. and MicroBT. Bitmain, valued at about $15 billion in a private funding round in 2018, revived plans for a U.S. listing last year after a failed attempt in less crypto-friendly Hong Kong in 2018, but that didn’t come to fruition either.The two co-founders had long served as co-CEOs but were replaced in March by Zhan’s pick, Wang Haichao, as the company struggled with layoffs and a cash crunch triggered by Bitcoin’s price plunge. Wang is still employed by the company.Bitmain’s market lead remains under attack. Canaan had a 22% market share of Bitcoin mining machines in terms of computing power sold in 2019’s first half, up from 15% for the same period the previous year, according Frost & Sullivan figures cited in Canaan’s IPO prospectus. While Bitmain and its major rivals produce machines with similar specifications and prices, they live and die competing against each other -- and smartphone makers -- for tight chip supplies from foundries operated by the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co.To contact the reporters on this story: Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.net;Benjamin Robertson in london at brobertson29@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Joanna OssingerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ousted-bitmain-co-founder-wages-113023737.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-31	2019-12-31 11:40:19	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Market Share Gains Will Keep Boosting AMD Stock	Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has provided investors with stellar returns of 154% in 2019. Even as AMD stock trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of 75.3, I believe that the rally is far from over.Source: Joseph GTK / Shutterstock.com Strong earnings growth and market share gain will continue to justify premium valuation and the positive trend will sustain. Therefore, AMD stock is worth holding through 2020.Earnings growth for 2020 is expected at 75.8% and this backs my point on valuations. In addition, earnings are likely to grow at a CAGR of 24.2% over the next five years. This is attractive as compared to industry level earnings growth expectation of 14.8%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBefore I talk about company-specific growth triggers, I want to add a note on the competition. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is clearly lagging behind Advanced Micro Devices. While the latter will experience strong earnings growth in the next five years, Intel's growth will be subdued. The company's CFO expects strong revenue growth and margin expansion in 2023. Importantly, 10nm node will be delayed and that will benefit AMD.  * 6 Transportation Stocks That Are Going Places AMD has already been surging ahead of Intel. Data from Mindfactory indicates that the AMD stock price upside is being driven by fundamental factors. Data from Mindfactory is limited to Germany, but if we look at the broad x86 processors market share, AMD has made meaningful inroads. The company's market share has increased from 22.3% in 3Q17 to 31.2% in 3Q19. I believe that this positive trend is likely to sustain. Gross Margin Expansion Will ContinueAdvanced Micro Devices reported a gross margin of 40% for 3Q18. For 3Q19, gross margin expanded by 300 basis points to 43%. Further, AMD has guided for 44% gross margin in 4Q19.Margin expansion is another key factor that will take the stock higher in 2020. Ryzen and EPYC processor sales have triggered margin expansion. As AMD continues to gain market share through Ryzen and EPYC, gross margin and cash flows will grow.Importantly, EPYC processor sales will be robust in the coming years with cloud and 5G acting as growth triggers.International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) are using AMD EPYC processors for their cloud and 5G customers. There are other big names that have already adopted AMD second generation EPYC processors.Ryzen momentum will also sustain in 2020 with the launch of 7-nanometre accelerated processing unit. In addition, AMD also has 7nm mobile chips to be launched in 2020. With a strong pipeline of products, sales, gross margin and earnings will continue to improve.To back my view on continued sales momentum, AMD CPUs have outperformed those of Intel-based CPUs on performance test. This gives an edge to AMD in 2020 and beyond. The partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is likely to ensure that AMD maintains the advantage. Trade Deal Supports AMD Stock UpsideAMD stock was range-bound for a large part of 2019. It was in October that the stock had a convincing break-out above $30.The first reason for the sharp rally is growth in market share, margin expansion and robust sales from new launches.The second key reason for the rally is the gradual progress in the trade deal between the United States and China. With phase one of the trade deal done, there are hopes that de-escalating tensions will boost GDP growth.With AMD deriving 39% of 2018 sales from China (including Taiwan), the trade deal should have positive implications on earnings growth. Both the cloud and enterprise segment stand to benefit. Recently, Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCHEY) announced that it will use AMD's EPYC processor in its internally-designed server. As the trade deal progresses, I expect more contracts from China to boost AMD's growth. My Final Views on AMD StockAMD stock does look expensive from a PE valuation perspective. However, with strong expected earnings growth for 2020 and beyond, the rally might sustain with intermediate corrections.With more product launches in 2020, the markets will remain excited and there is no doubt that AMD has an edge over Intel.AMD is also positioned for growth in free cash flows as gross margin expands. This will further improve the balance sheet as net debt declines.Overall, AMD stock remains interesting for 2020 and any profit booking can be used to consider fresh exposure to the stock.As of this writing, Faisal Humayun did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-23	2019-12-23 00:50:33	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Behind Samsung’s $116 Billion Bid for Chip Supremacy	(Bloomberg) -- Technology giants are increasingly designing their own semiconductors to optimize everything from artificial intelligence tasks to server performance and mobile battery life. Google has the Tensor Processing Unit, Apple Inc. has the A13 Bionic and Amazon.com Inc. has the Graviton2. What the titans all lack, however, is a factory to build the new chips they are dreaming up.Enter Samsung Electronics Co., which is planning a decade-long, $116 billion push for their business. The South Korean company is investing heavily in the next step in miniaturizing semiconductors, a process called extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). It’s by far the priciest manufacturing upgrade Samsung has ever attempted, a risky bid to move beyond its established business of cranking out commoditized silicon and to leapfrog the incumbent leaders in the $250 billion foundry and logic-chip industry.“A new market is opening up,” Yoon Jong Shik, executive vice president of Samsung’s foundry business, said at a forum recently held in Seoul. “Companies like Amazon, Google and Alibaba, which lack experience in silicon design, are seeking to make chips with their own concept ideas in order to boost their services. I think this would bring a significant breakthrough for our non-memory chip business.”Samsung is a relative underdog in this growing field. The foundry business -- as the manufacturing of chips for companies like Google and Qualcomm Inc. is known -- is dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. with more than half the market, according to TrendForce Corp. data that puts Samsung at 18%.TSMC also took over Apple’s A-series processor manufacturing from Samsung, which was the original production partner. Samsung plans to spend about $10 billion per year on equipment, research and development over the next decade, but TSMC is even more ambitious with capital expenditure of around $14 billion for this year and next.“It is not just a matter of willingness,” said CW Chung, head of pan-Asia technology at Nomura Financial Investment Co., in assessing Samsung’s chances of success. “Chip-making is like a composite art. Unless there are enough supports for all-round social infrastructures, it’d be a scarcely achievable goal.”To win over clients, top Samsung executives are touring major cities from San Jose to Munich to Shanghai, hosting foundry forums and negotiating deals. ES Jung, president and general manager for the foundry business, is the frontman delivering Samsung’s “can-do” spiel at every gathering, where his practiced joke is to suggest that his initials stand for “engineering sample.”“The complexity of the lines drawn by the EUV equipment is similar to building a spaceship,” said Jung while unveiling a $17 billion EUV plant in Hwaseong earlier this year, flanked by Samsung heir and de-facto boss Jay Y. Lee and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. The fab is planned to start mass production in February 2020.A single EUV machine from ASML Holding NV costs $172 million and Samsung is setting up dozens of them in Hwaseong in an effort to be first with the technology. TSMC and Samsung are both expected to reach 5-nanometer production processes with EUV in the new year, which means they’ll have only each other to compete with in a market that’s only set to expand. And once they ramp up and achieve economies of scale, the overall process cycle time is likely to decrease by 20% and the foundry capacity output will increase by 25%, according to a Citigroup Inc. research report.“TSMC is too busy with orders pouring in for new products as we enter into the 5G era,” said Greg Roh, senior vice president at Hyundai Motor Securities. “For Samsung, that’s bringing a good chance to expand their market share by offering lower prices and delivery schedules to meet clients’ needs.”Samsung is collaborating with major clients on designing and manufacturing custom chips and that work is already starting to add to its revenue, according to one Samsung executive who has direct knowledge of the matter. The push toward bespoke processors in Silicon Valley and China is opening up fresh opportunities and Samsung already has established relationships, as demonstrated by its recent announcement that it’ll produce an AI chip for Baidu Inc. early next year.Officials at Samsung believe the company has a competitive edge from its experience building both the chips and the devices that they go into. It is thus able to foresee and address the engineering requirements of its clients. Samsung believes its other trump card is an ability to package memory and logic chips into a single module, improving power and space efficiency. Analysts do warn, however, that some companies are wary about outsourcing production to a direct competitor in the consumer electronics market -- lest Samsung learns and copies their chip designs in its own products.“Ultimately, the success of Samsung’s logic chip business depends on its market positioning,” Hsu said. “On the foundry side, Samsung needs to eliminate its clients’ suspicions of Samsung LSI being a potential competitor.”Samsung is reaching out to smartphone-making rivals and has already agreed to sell 5G Exynos chips to Vivo. At the same time, it’s going to be manufacturing Qualcomm’s 5G mobile chipset using the same EUV process. On yet another front, the company is competing with foundry customer Sony Corp. in the growing market for image sensors, having this year unveiled an unprecedented 108-megapixel camera for smartphones. “I think Samsung’s CMOS image sensor business will continue to do well, riding on the industry boom,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anthea Lai.If Samsung can move ahead technologically, it should find no shortage of customers for its varied semiconductor offerings. Though China is increasingly turning to domestic suppliers for all things tech, the greater efficiency of EUV chips may be key in helping Samsung solicit business from the world’s second-biggest economy.“The increased demand for in-house chips spells good news for the growth of the foundry industry,” TrendForce analyst Chris Hsu said.&#92;--With assistance from Debby Wu.To contact the reporter on this story: Sohee Kim in Seoul at skim847@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad Savov, Peter ElstromFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/behind-samsung-116-billion-bid-005033417.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-12-16	2019-12-16 05:50:38	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Bitmain Rival’s Founder Arrested as War of Crypto Miners Heats up	(Bloomberg) -- A Chinese chip designer who helped Bitmain Technologies Ltd. become the world’s largest maker of Bitcoin mining rigs before starting his own company has been arrested, according to three people familiar with the matter.Yang Zuoxing, a tech mastermind with Bitmain until June 2016, was detained by police in Shenzhen at the end of October in relation to a legal dispute with his former employer, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing legal matters.Prosecutors in the city’s Nanshan district said in a Dec. 12 statement that Yang was arrested recently on suspicion of embezzlement, and that legal procedures were ongoing. The statement omitted the second of three Chinese characters that make up Yang’s full name, possibly to shield his identity. It didn’t mention Bitmain or MicroBT, the crypto-mining company Yang founded a month after quitting Bitmain.MicroBT has grown into a serious contender, clawing market share away from Bitmain with its Whatsminer equipment. While crypto-miner makers produce machines with similar specs and prices, they compete against each other for tight chip supplies from foundries operated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co.The arrest of Yang comes as competition between Bitmain and its rivals intensifies. While MicroBT’s flagship Whatsminer 20 series are the best-selling Bitcoin mining rigs so far this year, Yang’s absence has halted his company’s ability to make key decisions including on pricing, said two of the people.Representatives of MicroBT and Bitmain declined to comment. The prosecutors’ office in Nanshan didn’t respond immediately to a request for comment.Bitmain has waged several legal battles against prominent ex-staffers. In 2018 the Beijing-based company lost a court ruling against MicroBT over allegations that Yang’s startup infringed its patent rights. Earlier this year, Bitmain filed a lawsuit against three former employees who started rival mining pool Poolin for allegedly violating a non-compete agreement.An internal power struggle within Bitmain saw billionaire chief Wu Jihan kick co-founder Micree Zhan out of the company recently, and the company has been trying to tout new sales initiatives to lure new customers.Yang toldpreviously that he helped Bitmain design its highly sought-after machines, but he left the company after Wu and Zhan turned down his request for a stake in the business. Yang, the majority shareholder of MicroBT, graduated from Beijing’s prestigious Tsinghua University with a PhD in mechatronics before entering the chip-design industry.Read more: Ex-Bitmain Chip Designer Takes on Crypto’s Mining GoliathTo contact the reporter on this story: Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Colum Murphy, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitmain-rival-founder-arrested-war-055038718.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-12-15	2019-12-15 22:00:04	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	China's Chip Quest Is All Heart, Not Enough Brain	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China has made developing its own chip industry a matter of patriotic pride. It helps that “China chip” and “China heart” sound the same in the local language. The strain of this 1.7 trillion yuan ($243 billion) endeavor may be too much for the debt-clogged arteries of its municipal governments, though.Over the past decade, Beijing hasn’t hesitated to deploy its fiscal might in pursuit of economic and social objectives. After the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, the government spent 4 trillion yuan building roads and railways to bolster the economy, sending growth into overdrive. Between 2015 and 2018, authorities poured roughly 3.5 trillion yuan into shanty-town developments to aid the poor.Lately, fiscal spending has turned to loftier aspirations. With its national champions ZTE Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co. pinched by U.S. sanctions, China has become more determined to develop its own 5G, artificial-intelligence and chip technologies. More than 50 large-scale semiconductor projects have sprung up across the country, with a total of 1.7 trillion yuan of investment pledged, online media outlet Caixin estimates. Most of these multibillion-dollar projects will be state-financed. For instance, the government holds 74% of the equity in three-year-old Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. The company is managed by Tsinghua Unigroup Co., the business arm of prestigious Tsinghua University, President Xi Jinping’s alma mater. Yangtze Memory’s NAND memory technology shows potential, and is only half a generation behind the global flash memory leaders. Huawei subsidiary HiSilicon, meanwhile, is seen as a leading design house for smartphone applications.These promising examples are too few and far between, though. Elsewhere, it’s mostly too much effort for too little reward. China’s chip manufacturing technology is three to five years behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s leading contract supplier, and the country is sub-scale in assembly and testing, industry experts say. Meanwhile, financial cracks are showing. A chip park in eastern China, with 4.5 billion yuan already spent, has ground to a halt after the impoverished municipal government failed to cough up more money, a Caixin investigation found. Another industrial park in the central city of Wuhan had its land usage rights frozen by a court because of financial difficulties. Wuhan has positioned itself as an inland technology hub in the mold of Phoenix, Arizona.As Korean and Taiwanese industry leaders know, chip manufacturing is a terribly expensive business. Samsung Electronics Co., for instance, splashed out about $25 billion annually in capital expenditure over the past five years. To catch up with TSMC’s leading-edge wafer capacity, a Chinese chip park needs to spend about $60 billion to $80 billion on equipment alone, Credit Suisse Group AG estimates. To make matters worse, bureaucrats from regions rich and poor are vying with each other to produce a national champion, seeing that the project is close to President Xi’s heart. As I wondered a year ago, what’s the advantage for Xiamen, a sleepy coastal city in southern China, or Guizhou, one of China’s poorest provinces, of getting into chip manufacturing? The result is resources spread too thin, wages bid up, and billions of dollars wasted in a business that’s all about scale.To be sure, bureaucrats the world over launch pet projects to please their bosses. But this chip craze begs the question of whether public funding is being properly used, especially as China’s economy struggles. The central government’s Big Fund and its clones aren’t dumb money — they will only finance true national champions such as Yangtze Memory; local industrial parks will have to be funded locally. The Tianjin government, for instance, doesn’t have the cash to bail out state-owned commodities trader Tewoo Group Corp., but nonetheless has a $16 billion fund for AI technology, another theme close to Xi’s heart.China’s local governments are notoriously poor: Municipals do all the dirty work of generating cash, but remit those funds to the Ministry of Finance, which then decides how to dole it out. As a result, even cities as wealthy as Beijing are deep in the red. As the economy slows and tax collection sputters, the situation will only get more severe. Local governments continue to spend more than they earn, with this year’s funding gap at 7.6 trillion yuan, Moody’s estimates. China’s desire for self-reliance is understandable. Last year, its trade deficit in chips widened to $228 billion, more than double what it was a decade earlier. Meanwhile, U.S. restrictions on exports of chip technology have provoked an intense nationalist backlash in China. Yet so far, this semiconductor drive has been all heart and no brain. To contact the author of this story: Shuli Ren at sren38@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2019-12-10	2019-12-10 04:17:18	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Bitmain Chief Plots Crypto Comeback After Co-Founder Ouster	(Bloomberg) -- Bitmain Technologies Ltd.’s billionaire Chief Executive Officer Wu Jihan is back in the driver’s seat following the ouster of his co-founder, touting new sales initiatives to attract clients as the company fends off rivals.Wu hosted a client meeting on Saturday, according to attendees who asked not to be identified because the event was private. It was his first public appearance since a power struggle six weeks ago when he announced as founder and chairman that his co-founder Micree Zhan Ketuan was no longer with the company. It also marked Wu’s re-emergence as the company’s CEO following his loss of control to Zhan, who had held de facto leadership from March until his resignation.Wu and other Bitmain executives announced at the event new sales initiatives to lure customers, including a promise to seek deposits as low as 20% for those who buy its Bitcoin mining rigs in large bulk, the attendees said. Usually, such deposits are 50% or full payment in advance is required. The latest models from Bitmain cost between $1,000 to $2,000. “The Bitmain you are familiar with is back,” read a presentation slide from the gathering, which took place in southwestern China’s Chengdu city, a hub for local miners. Nishant Sharma, a Bitmain spokesman, declined to comment.Bitmain revived plans for a U.S. listing earlier this year after its failed attempt in less crypto-friendly Hong Kong in 2018. The company, which was valued at about $15 billion in a private funding round last year, is grappling with intensifying competition from smaller rivals U.S.-listed Canaan Inc. and MicroBT.Canaan had a 22% market share of Bitcoin mining machines in terms of computing power sold in 2019’s first half, up from 15% for the same period last year, according Frost & Sullivan figures cited in Canaan’s IPO prospectus. While Bitmain and its major rivals produce machines with similar specs and prices, they live and die competing against each other -- and smartphone makers -- for tight chip supplies from foundries operated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co.Bitmain’s two co-founders had long served as co-CEOs but they had been replaced this March by Zhan’s pick, Wang Haichao, as the company was grappling with lay-offs and a cash crunch triggered by Bitcoin’s price plunge. Wang is still employed by the company.In October, Wu announced Zhan’s resignation in a memo, warning employees against taking further instructions from Zhan or attending any meetings he convened. The two had started the mining gear company together six years ago.Saturday’s event reaffirms Wu’s control of the company. Fan Xiaojun, a long-time Bitmain sales chief who had been demoted by Zhan, showed up at the meeting and had regained his position, said the attendees. Bitmain also promoted Wu’s new crypto financial startup Matrixport at the event, they said. Right after Wu’s note about Zhan’s departure, Wu also announced his pick for the company’s head of human resources to replace Zhan’s appointee, according to a memo viewed by Bloomberg News.To contact the reporter on this story: Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitmain-chief-plots-crypto-comeback-041718286.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-22	2019-11-22 18:21:10	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Time to Cash In the Chips on the Semiconductor Stocks	Shares of the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) exchange-traded fund have had a monstrous run since making lows at the $80 area last Christmas. This ETF, which  is comprised of the largest computer chipmakers, is up over 50% this year. This is double the impressive 26% total return of the S&P 500.Source: Shutterstock Certainly some of the outperformance was warranted, given the previous pessimism surrounding semiconductor stocks. The red-hot rally has now come too far, too fast though. Time for SMH to underperform over the coming weeks.SMH is comprised of 25 of the top chipmaking stocks listed on the U.S. exchanges. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are the two largest holdings and account for 25% of the overall weighting. As such, these two chip making giants have the biggest impact on the SMH.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Fundamentals of Semiconductor Stocks in the SMH ETFA quick look at the current fundamentals of Taiwan Semiconductors show valuations to be at an extreme. The price-to-earnings of 24.5 is at the richest multiple in the past 10 years and at a 50% premium to its 5-year average of 16. The price-to-sales ratio is now at a rather rich 8X, also a 10-year high by a wide margin. The price-to-book ratio just passed 5 for the first time in the last decade.Intel also just reached a new 10-year high on a price-to-sales basis with a reading of 3.7X. Its price to book is also at a similar extreme at 3.4X. Certainly not cheap on either a comparative or absolute basis.  * 7 Companies Using Artificial Intelligence to Outperform the Market SMH reached extremely overbought levels on a technical basis before finally pulling back. The 9-day RSI breached the 70 level before turning sharply lower. Prior instances when this occurred marked significant short term tops in semiconductor stocks. MACD just went negative and issued a sell signal. Shares traded at a big premium to the 50-day moving average before finally turning lower.More importantly, SMH had a reversal day Tuesday. The semiconductor ETF tried but failed to make a new high by a penny, then reversed to close lower on the day. This type of pattern is many times emblematic of a short term top in the underlying. The buyers have finally become exhausted and the sellers have taken control. It is an even more powerful indicator given the strength of the previous rally in SMH and that it happened at all-time highs.The chart shows that prior instances when the SMH ETF reversed from overbought conditions led to a pullback to at the least the 50-day moving average -- or a further drop to the trendline. In this case, that equates to an initial downside target of $125 with an ultimate downside target of $120.Stock traders should use any strength to short SMH. A meaningful breakout to new all-time highs would be a viable stop out area. Downside profit objectives are at the previously mentioned $125 and $120 levels.Option traders should look to take advantage of comparatively cheap implied volatility (IV) at only the 17th percentile and buy a put diagonal. The Jan $127/Dec $125 is priced around $2.50. Maximum risk on the trade is $250 per spread. Ideally SMH clsoes near $125 at December expiration. the trade structure allows for additional selling of weekly options to further reduce the initial cost.As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Customers of the Santa Clara, California-based company include Samsung Electronics Co., Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., giving it a reach that makes its results and forecasts an important early indicator of business confidence. Intel and other chipmakers order equipment months in advance of starting new factories and production lines.Key InsightsFiscal first-quarter sales will be about $4.1 billion, Applied Materials said Thursday in a statement. That compares with analysts’ average estimate of $3.71 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Adjusted earnings per share will be 87 cents to 95 cents, the company said. Analysts projected 75 cents a share.The results “reflect a healthy uptick in demand for semiconductor equipment, combined with strong execution across the company,” Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said in the statement.Chip-equipment makers often experience wild earnings swings. Machines cost tens of millions of dollars each. Delaying factory build outs is one of the fastest ways a chipmaker can preserve cash when they’re unsure of future demand.Net income was $698 million, or 75 cents a share in the period ended Oct. 27, compared with $757 million, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier.Revenue was little changed at $3.75 billion. Analysts were looking for $3.68 billion.Stock ReactionShares rose about 4% in extended trading after the announcement. The stock closed at $56.96 in New York and has increased 74% this year.More InformationFor more details, click here.To see the statement, click here.To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applied-materials-projects-strong-sales-211218229.html?.tsrc=rss

It’s now said to expect iPhone shipments to return to growth in 2020 when it finally introduces its own 5G devices -- a boon to hardware suppliers such as Hon Hai and chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. coping with a decelerating smartphone market. Assembly partners like Hon Hai and TSMC typically begin gearing up for production weeks, if not months, ahead of a device’s commercial launch.The outlook for Apple and its main suppliers remains overshadowed by an ongoing trade war. AirPods, Apple Watch, HomePod and other devices made in China have been hit with 15% tariffs, and U.S. President Donald Trump hasn’t ruled out the possibility of a levy on iPhones starting Dec. 15. Hon Hai said it’s getting into the production of wearable gear next year, potentially competing for more Apple business but also increasing its exposure to the trade war.Hon Hai, which gets half its revenue from its Cupertino, California partner, is now diversifying away from its main Chinese production base to mitigate the impact of potential punitive tariffs. It’s spending more than NT$17 billion building factories in India and Vietnam, responding to customers’ needs, Chief Financial Officer David Huang said at an earnings conference. Those two countries will become regional manufacturing hubs, he added.Read more: Apple Expects IPhone Shipments to Return to Growth in 2020Hon Hai’s investment encapsulates a fundamental trend that’s beginning to shake up production of most of the world’s electronics. Taiwanese companies like Hon Hai, which today make most of the most recognizable brands, began investing in China decades ago, kicking off a transformation that’s made China the world’s factory floor. But faced with growing trade tensions and U.S. tariffs, the leaders of those companies -- which typically operate on wafer-thin margins -- are reconsidering their commitment to China.Read more: The Tycoons Behind China’s Gadget Factories Boom Prepare to ExitAlthough any pivot away from the country is just starting, factories that leave won’t come back anytime soon.

Gou has said he intends to press ahead with construction of a display panel factory in the state of Wisconsin, an endeavor once tagged as a $10 billion investment but that has fallen far behind schedule. Vice Chairman Jay Lee said that project was “‘on track.” Hon Hai has completed initial construction on the first, main factory and the company will also target the defense and aviation markets with its panels, he added.Hon Hai executives also forecast a rebound in consumer electronics demand in 2020, which could help prop up its top line. The company reported NT$1.39 trillion in sales for the September quarter, barely changed from a year earlier. Chairman Young Liu said the firm’s goal is to achieve 10% gross margins within three to five years. Its shares closed down 1.4% ahead of the earnings on Wednesday, after gaining 27% this year.“The lower pricing of the iPhone 11 has been effective in driving demand past the Street’s expectations,” Sean Lin, an analyst at President Capital Management Corp., said in a Nov. 4 note.(Updates with executives’ comments from the fifth paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-assembler-profit-beats-signaling-070055457.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-04	2019-11-04 22:00:02	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	This Star Chipmaker Really Doesn't Want to Pick Sides	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- You’ve got to feel for Mark Liu. The chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. just wants to make chips.And he does; the best chips for the best companies in the world. Unfortunately, one of his clients is Huawei Technologies Co. So it’s not surprising that the world’s largest contract chipmaker has found itself in something of a pickle. On the one hand, you’ve got officials in Washington repeatedly asking Taiwan’s government to restrain TSMC from selling chips to Huawei, as the Financial Times reported Monday, citing government sources in both the U.S. and Taiwan. The Chinese electronics giant — which the U.S. has accused of spying — is one of TSMC’s top-five clients and likely contributes roughly 5% to 10% of annual revenue.On the other is China, with a government-led policy to design and build more semiconductors in the coming years. Demand from U.S. companies currently dwarfs that of Huawei and other Chinese names. American tech giants such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Corp. and Nvidia Corp. together account for 61% of TSMC’s revenue, and comprise the biggest buyers of the Taiwanese company’s most advanced technologies. But China is growing quickly, which leaves TSMC with an unappealing choice: Upset its current large client base in the U.S., or risk losing a future client base in China.There are two things that the U.S. is most scared about when it comes to TSMC. The first is that Chinese companies may get access to the best technology, including semiconductors, that could be used for nefarious purposes, which explains the pressure the FT cites. The other is that the U.S. itself may be cut off from the hardware supply chain, at the heart of which is TSMC.This is why U.S. officials have been hoping that manufacturers like TSMC would expand in America. At present, most of the company’s capacity is spread across three locations in north, central and southern Taiwan. It has two factories in China (the technology made there isn’t as advanced as back home) and one older facility in the U.S. Liu has politely pushed back against U.S. expansion citing the steep costs. In reality, it’s more the daunting logistics of setting up and staffing an advanced factory so far from home base where all the R&D is done. Each of its Taiwan facilities are close enough that engineers can move around and troubleshoot with relative ease. That makes TSMC the belle of the ball. Which sounds nice, except when it comes to choosing a dance partner — and Liu doesn’t want to have to decide. I’ve argued before that everyone will need to pick sides at some point as the digital Iron Curtain falls. For TSMC, this probably won’t come as a declaratory statement, but through quiet and subtle decisions on which cases it will accept and which it will turn down. This brings us back to Liu. In response to the FT report, TSMC spokeswoman Elizabeth Sun told Bloomberg News that the U.S. has not in fact asked it to stop supplying Huawei. Liu met with Commerce Department officials during a U.S. trip earlier this year where they talked about the Chinese company, she said, without elaborating on what they discussed. Meanwhile, a Taiwan cabinet spokeswoman denied that the U.S. asked its government to stop TSMC from shipping to Huawei. (1)I have covered TSMC for almost 20 years, and the notion that the Taiwan government would, or even could, tell the chipmaker what to do is hard to fathom. TSMC is Taiwan’s largest company. It’s publicly listed, has independent management and board of directors, and an impeccable reputation for corporate governance. As a chipmaker to the stars, there’s no other company in the world that can do what TSMC does in terms of technological prowess or sheer capacity. Samsung Electronics Co. and Intel Corp. are its nearest rivals.For now Liu can afford to rebuff pressure — direct or indirect — to cut off Huawei and expand in the U.S. TSMC holds all the cards because American clients desperately need the Taiwanese company’s technology, and Chinese ones aren’t big enough to buy up all of its factory capacity. It may end up offering to build a facility in America as an appeasement move.But TSMC won’t be able to sit on the fence forever. While Liu may want to just make chips, he’ll eventually have to make a choice.(1) I take the denial of Taiwan’s governmentwith a pinch of salt. It’s likely the U.S. consulted with Taiwanese officials on how to deal with the issue, though they may have stopped short of pressuring the company directly.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2019-10-29	2019-10-29 22:50:39	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Advanced Micro Devices Gives In-Line Revenue Forecast	(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave a quarterly sales forecast that was in line with analysts’ estimates, suggesting the No. 2 maker of computer processors is gaining ground on Intel Corp.Revenue in the current period will be about $2.1 billion, plus or minus $50 million, Santa Clara, California-based AMD said Tuesday in a statement. That compares with an average analyst projection of $2.15 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Under Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su, AMD has introduced a raft of new products that reviewers and some customers say are competitive or better than those from Intel. That’s sparked a surge in AMD stock. Now investors want to see evidence that the new offerings are generating more orders.AMD took share in desktop computer chips and will continue to make gains in the market for chips that power the servers that are the backbone of corporate networks and the internet, Su said on a conference call with analysts.“We remain on track to achieve our near-term goal of double-digit server CPU share by mid-next year,” she said. Su also rejected Intel’s assertion that it’s only giving up market share in chips for cheap PCs.Intel, which has about 90% of the processor market, gave an upbeat sales forecast last week and executives said they hadn’t seen increasing competition. The company’s profit is about three times the size of AMD’s revenue.On Tuesday, AMD said third-quarter net income rose to $120 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $102 million, or 9 cents, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, profit in the recent period was 18 cents a share, meeting analysts’ projections. Revenue in the period was $1.8 billion, up 9% from the same period a year earlier. That was in line with Wall Street estimates.AMD’s gross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, widened to 43% in the third quarter. A year earlier, that measure of profitability came in at 40%. Minus certain items, the margin will be 44% in the fourth quarter, widening the annual number for 2019 to 43%, AMD said.The company’s shares were little changed in extended trading following the report, after ending at $33.03 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 79% this year.AMD has been trying to get back into the lucrative business of server chips. While it’s a lower-volume sector, server chips command much higher prices. AMD has about 3% of this market. The last time it was truly competitive with Intel, more than a decade ago, it had a quarter of that business.Sales of AMD’s new Epyc server chip are reported as part of a unit that includes other chips used by Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. in their game consoles. Demand for those processors slumped, dragging down the division’s sales by 27% from a year earlier. AMD said Epyc sales and shipments jumped more than 50% compared with the prior period.In personal computer processors and graphics, AMD’s sales increased 36% year over year. That performance was helped by the higher average selling prices of its newer products, AMD said.AMD is also trying to exploit Intel’s delays in shifting production to more advanced technology. AMD now outsources manufacturing of its best chips to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which analysts calculate is more than a year ahead of Intel in implementing new processes.(Updates with comment from CEO in fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-gives-line-210207814.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-25	2019-10-25 13:37:05	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	3 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks Top Investors Are Buying	TipRanks has built a reputation on collecting the right information for investors looking to make informed decisions on their stock purchases. The database includes more than 5,500 of Wall Street’s most prolific financial analysts, rated and ranked by their success rate and average return.As the database has grown, TipRanks has added new features and tools to make the data more flexible for users. Over 10,000 financial bloggers, 44,000 corporate insiders, and 99,000 individual investors have made their stock reviews, purchase decisions, and portfolios available to TipRanks’ algorithms.Today, we’ll look at three stocks through the lens of the TipRanks' Individual Investor Sentiment tool. This nifty tool enables you to pinpoint the most popular stocks from the best-performing investors in any sector. We can also see if top investors are ramping up their holdings over the last month/week, as well as the proportion of the portfolio these investors (on average) dedicate to that stock.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)The only company from Taiwan among the world’s top 15 semiconductor manufacturers, Taiwan Semi recorded $34.2 billion in total sales for 2018. The only US company to post higher sales numbers was industry giant Intel, but TSM shows a higher market cap, at $260 billion. Taiwan Semi also pleases shareholders with a generous dividend, paying out a yield of 3.19%, or 62% more than the average yield on the S&P 500.TSM shares make up a modest part of TipRanks’ tracked portfolios, but a slightly larger portion of best performing investors’ holdings. These top sock buyers allocate 2.6% of their holdings to TSM, and sentiment on the stock registers as ‘Very Positive.’ Share holdings among the best performing individual investors have increased in both the last week and the last 30 days.The positive investor sentiment on TSM is reflected in the stock’s share price performance. TSM has been rising steadily (despite a minor slip in July) in the markets since mid-June of this year. The stock is 37.5% higher than its June 17 bottom of $36.47.The Street’s analysts are also bullish on TSM. From Goldman Sachs, Bruce Lu puts a Buy on the stock along with a $55 price target. He writes, “Following a re-examination of industry capacity builds and order revisions, we think we are underestimating the positive impacts on TSMC arising from trade uncertainty.” Lu’s price target indicates a possible 9% upside. (To watch Lu's track record, click here)Credit Suisse’s 4-star analyst Randy Abrams puts another Buy rating on TSM. He said, “While the stock may see profit taking on the rally and high capex with some risks on magnitude of 5G ramps, we remain positive into 2020 from higher share, content, and units in mobile and drivers for its HPC business, which could accelerate 2020 sales +14% YoY.”All in all, the chip maker remains a 'Strong Buy' name among Wall Street analysts. In the last three months, TSM has won 5 back-to-back bullish recommendations. With a return potential of close to 8%, the stock's consensus price target stands at $55.00. (See TSM stock analysis on TipRanks)Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN)Top investors are definitely keeping their eyes open on Alexion, a large-cap ($23.9 billion) bio-pharma. While only 1.9% of all portfolios in the TipRanks database hold Alexion, significantly more, 2.6%, of the top investors are buying this stock. And their holdings have increased by nearly a half-percent in the last month. Taken together, this puts a Very Positive investor outlook on ALXN.ALXN has seen its share price slip 29% since April despite steady gains in the quarterly earnings for the last two years. The company is best-known for Soliris, launched in 2007 as a treatment for two diseases, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The drug received approval in 2011, and at that time was considered the world’s most expensive medication, costing more than $400,000 per patient per year of treatment in the US. Soliris sales exceeded $600 million annually by 2015.In 2015, Alexion received FDA approval for a second rare-disorder treatment, Strensiq, and acquired the rights to a third drug, Kanuma, through acquisition of the parent company. Alexion estimates that Kanuma may generate more than $1 billion in annual sales.Sales numbers like that are reflected in ALXN’s earnings and revenues. In its just-released Q3 report, the company showed $1.26 billion in revenue, far above the year-ago quarter’s $1.03 billion. EPS, at $2.49 per share, was 12% higher than the forecast and 23% higher than the previous Q3. Alexion consistently beats the forecasts in its quarterly earnings reports.5-star analyst Christopher Raymond, of Piper Jaffray, believes that ALXN’s combination of relatively low share price and robust earnings offers a chance to pick up a first-class stock at a discount. He writes, “We remain a buyer of ALXN shares following yet another beat/raise quarter with near flawless execution both commercially and developmentally…” Raymond’s $180 price target suggests an eye-opening 68% upside to this stock. (To watch Raymond's track record, click here)The rest of Wall Street echoes Raymond's bullish play, as TipRanks analytics exhibit ALXN as a Strong Buy. Out of 18 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 16 are bullish on the stock while only two remain sidelined. With a return potential of nearly 46%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $155.38. (See ALXN stock analysis on TipRanks)Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Our third stock with Very Positive investor sentiment is Archer-Daniels-Midland, ADM. This company is leader in the global food production industry. Headquartered in Chicago, ADM operates a global network comprising hundreds of crop procurement facilities and production plants, which it uses in the development and manufacture of food, beverage, animal feed, and nutraceutical products. It’s a massive industry, and in brings ADM over $64 billion in annual revenue.Like the markets generally, ADM saw losses in 2H18, but earnings have shown moderate rebound since Q2 2019. A hard winter in the US and Canada had a damping effect on earnings, which showed a year-over-year decline, but the 60 cents EPS was a gain of 30% from Q1. Quarterly revenues, at $16.3 billion, were down 4.5% year-over-year, but beat the quarterly forecast by 4.2%. So, a decidedly mixed Q2 report did show some positive signs.Investors remain sanguine on ADM. Even after the quarterly report, the top investors have increased their holdings in this stock by 0.4%, and in the last seven days have increased holdings by 0.2%. One factor that may attract investors is the 3.44% dividend yield. With the S&P 500 stocks averaging just a 2% yield, ADM is well ahead of the curve. The $1.40 annualized payment represents a steady income, and the company has been increasing dividend payments to shareholders reliably for the last 43 years. The payout ratio of 51% indicates a commitment to both rewarding shareholders and keeping the dividend sustainable.Stephens’ 4-star analyst Ben Beinvenu sees ADM as a solid stock to anchor a portfolio. He lays out the bottom line on this one in clear terms: “We think ADM offers investors a consistent capital allocation strategy and solid long-term secular demand exposure at an attractive valuation… fundamentals have been under pressure and earnings are well below average. We think that the current stock price offers patient, value-oriented investors a solid entry point to buy a company that will pay a healthy dividend while we wait for the maturation of new businesses … to drive a return to more normalized earnings power.”Beinvenu gives ADM a $50 price target, suggesting a 22% upside from the current share price of $40.73. On average, the Street’s analysts agree with him; this stock has a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average price target is $48, implying room for an 18% upside.

2019-10-21	2019-10-21 18:02:01	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Semiconductor Stocks Are Breaking Out	As usual, last week's headlines were filled with anything but positive news. Trade war scares, partisan politics and out-of-context economic figures hid an incredible story. In this episode of Matt McCall's &quot;Moneyline&quot; podcast, he discusses what was at the heart of this silver lining: semiconductor stocks.Based off the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index, as tracked by the iShares PSLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), semiconductor stocks hit all-time highs last week, powered by a breakout in some big names. But almost no financial media outlets covered this success. Why? McCall uses this to illustrate the dangers in turning to the likes of CNBC and Fox Business for investment advice. Instead, just read the headlines for entertainment.So what had semiconductor stocks soaring? Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the way, reaching an 11-month high last week. Nvidia stock has several catalysts. The 5G rollout, data centers, high-tech gaming and self-driving cars all will use Nvidia chips. Additionally, with rumors of a U.S.-China trade war resolution on the way, any sign of peace could boost NVDA and its peers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut NVDA didn't lead the breakout alone. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) also contributed to last week's record. As 5G keeps growing, make sure to keep your eyes peeled on semiconductor stocks. McCall's Podcast﻿Unfortunately for investors, McCall argues that the financial press also obscured the truth behind September's retail sales numbers. Instead of focusing on the positives, many reported that September's sales were down 0.3% from August. But, year-over-year, September's numbers were up 4.1%.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before December's Meltdown True, auto sales and receipts at service stations both fell. But McCall points out that the service station figure most likely reflects cheaper gasoline. Plus, the core retail sales figure doesn't count those categories due to their historical volatility. On the brighter side, clothing and furniture sales were both up, as were sales from restaurants and bars. To McCall, one thing is very clear: The U.S. consumer is still very healthy.So instead of listening to the naysayers, do your own research. That's why McCall prefers to do his own boots-on-the-ground exploring. Through this practice, he's found several stocks to buy. One name is a growing star in the retail space -- and another sign the consumer is still happy and healthy.Tune into &quot;Moneyline&quot; for more information on Canadian-based Aritzia (OTCMKTS:ATZAF) and more insight on last week's gloomy headlines.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2019-10-18	2019-10-18 12:26:55	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Has Intel Stock Found a Catalyst?	About a week ago, things were looking much simpler for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock bulls. On Oct. 11, the U.S. and China announced a partial deal in the ongoing trade war. This was welcome news for semiconductor stocks such as INTC that have been trading in a range.Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com However, it quickly became apparent that the trade deal wasn't really a deal at all. It was more of a truce. Both sides made concessions. But there was no agreement on the issues that would make a difference for semiconductor stocks.This means current or prospective investors in INTC stock are back to trading on other news surrounding the stock. Fortunately for Intel, it has recently made a significant investment that may help change the current narrative.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Making a Big Bet on 5GOn Oct. 15, Intel announced an agreement to purchase a software business, Smart Edge, from Pivot Technology Solutions for $27 million.  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy Smart Edge is software that focuses on &quot;edge computing.&quot; Edge computing splits data and stores it closer to users, making computing devices respond faster. The software runs on Intel chips. This is allowing Intel to carve out a niche in the 5G space. This will be a critical opportunity to expand its revenue stream beyond its two large business segments of personal computers and data centers.&quot;We plan to take full advantage of our combined technologies and teams to accelerate the development of the edge computing market,&quot; Dan Rodriguez, a general manager of the network computer division in Intel's data center group, said in a statement. Why Did Intel Stock Drop?Intel stock was trading around $60 per share until it released first-quarter earnings. The company gave downward revenue guidance of $69 billion, which was $2 billion lower than analysts' estimates. Perhaps more concerning to investors is that if that revenue number held it would mark a decline a 2.5% decline in year-over-year revenue. In 2018, Intel posted revenue of $70.8 billion.But the stock lost nearly 25% of its value. Was this a disproportionate response? Perhaps. But what has to be concerning for investors is that INTC stock has attempted and failed to breach a crucial level of resistance at around $53 two separate times.The general consensus is that Intel stock is paying too steep of a price. However, there's a difference between what a stock should be doing and what it actually is doing. The problem for INTC stock has been a steady stream of news that is giving investors pause. Hampered By Production DelaysUnlike most semiconductor companies, Intel manufactures its own chips. This has been a strategic advantage for the company. But at the moment, it is proving to be an obstacle. The company has struggled in its transition from 14-nanometer chips to 10-nanometer chips. When Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) introduced 7-nanometer chips, original equipment manufacturers became frustrated with Intel's chip shortage and started giving business to AMD. This has been one of many negative drags on the stock.AMD outsources its CPU production to dedicated foundries. One of those is TSMC (NYSE:TSM), which is now ahead of Intel in the manufacturing process. While Intel says it will resolve its 14-nanometer shortage during 2019, DigiTimes recently reported that the shortage may last until next year. INTC Stock Looks Undervalued at the MomentIntel is trading at price-earnings ratio of below 12 (11.88 as of this writing). That is significantly less than rivals Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), AMD and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Those companies have PE ratios of 29.58, 93.66 and 21.20, respectively. But it's also significantly below its historical trading level of 15-times earnings or higher.If INTC stock were valued at 15 times earnings right now, it would have a stock price of approximately $64.50 per share. But it's not trading at that multiple. And analysts predict that INTC will post a decline in non-GAAP earnings for both Q3 and Q4 earnings on a YOY basis. This makes a case that INTC stock could be going down before it goes up.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not have a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-18	2019-10-18 02:30:03	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC’s $15 Billion Splurge Galvanizes Hope of 5G-Led Rebound	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s plan to spend as much as $15 billion on technology and capacity in 2019 -- roughly 50% higher than originally envisioned -- is spurring hopes that the dawn of fifth-generation networks will rev up global chip and smartphone demand.The primary chip supplier to Apple Inc. told investors it’s sharply increasing its estimate for 2019 capital expenditure to between $14 billion to $15 billion from as much as $11 billion previously, and Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said 2020 spending will be similar. The Taiwanese company also projected current-quarter revenue ahead of estimates, an affirmation that the latest iPhones have proven a hit with consumers.Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei sketched out hopes that the emergence of 5G, the foundation of future technologies from automated factories and smart homes to blazing-fast consumer electronics, will help underpin its business in coming years. TSMC, which is the world’s largest contract chipmaker, and is seen as a barometer for the tech industry thanks to its heft and place in the supply chain, said the advent of 5G-enabled smartphones will result in more chips in devices than before.“We are much more optimistic than six months ago,” Wei said, adding that the 5G momentum was larger than the company expected. TSMC has increased its forecast of the 5G smartphone penetration rate in 2020 to a percentage in the mid-teens from its previous single-digit estimate. Many countries, especially larger ones, were rapidly pushing ahead with 5G rollout plans, Wei added.TSMC Puts All Its Chips on Capex. That’s a Smart Bet: Tim CulpanTSMC’s capital spending plan and outlook prompted price-target hikes from several analysts including at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Its shares, which notched a lifetime high just this month, stood largely unchanged Friday in Taipei. More broadly, suppliers including ASML Holding NV, Applied Materials Inc. and Tokyo Electron Ltd. could stand to benefit from TSMC’s capex increase.In addition to 5G, TSMC’s push is driven by growing demand from tech giants such as Apple and Huawei Technologies Co., said Roger Sheng, a semiconductor analyst with Gartner. Although the outlook remains uncertain for 2020, the global semiconductor market is set to make a gradual recovery on the back of the demand related to 5G, AI and automotive applications, according to a note from TrendForce on Oct. 2.“Everyone is waiting to see a bounce back of global smartphone market next year after Apple adopts 5G. The self-designed Huawei chipsets will also push demand, as will Qualcomm’s 5nm chips for next year and AMD’s server chip demand,” Sheng said.On Thursday, TSMC also underlined expectations that Apple, its largest customer, is riding a bounce-back in demand for the iPhones after a lukewarm 2018 iteration. Lower prices and aging handsets are helping drive demand for the iPhone 11 range, and Apple is said to be asking its assemblers to target the high end of an original forecast for 70 million to 75 million unit shipments in 2019.Read more: Apple’s Lower Prices, Users’ Aging Handsets Drive IPhone DemandThe Taiwanese company foresees revenue of $10.2 billion to $10.3 billion in the pivotal December holiday quarter, surpassing an average projection for about $9.9 billion. TSMC gave that sales outlook after reporting net income of NT$101.1 billion ($3.3 billion) for the September quarter, handily beating estimates as the global chip market recovers.Still, fallout from ongoing trade conflicts could crimp an industry revival. While TSMC doesn’t factor trade conflicts into its capex plans, any international trade war will have a negative effect on the semiconductor sector, Wei said. China is an especially important market for TSMC and the semiconductor industry, he added.TSMC and its industry peers had grappled with a plateauing smartphone market, efforts by Apple to move beyond hardware, and U.S. tech-export curbs on No. 2 customer Huawei. But investors are growing more confident that the emergence of 5G will prop up chip prices and demand, while the latest iPhones are firing up consumers. TSMC is in fact straining against capacity constraints in the current quarter, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Mark Li said.The “iPhone is driving stronger near-term demand. We believe the competitive pricing of iPhone 11 is garnering good traction and has prompted Apple to place more orders at the supply chain,” Li said in an Oct. 10 note.Read more: Taiwan’s Market Fortunes Are Tied to TSMC Like Never Before(Updates with analysts’ hikes and shares from the fifth paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.net;Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-profit-beats-estimates-thanks-053547980.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-10-17	2019-10-17 22:00:24	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC Just Showed Its Chips Are Hot	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Investors looking for signs that the worst is over for the chip sector would be pleased by what Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. served up Thursday. All of its key earnings data point to a rebound in demand, and more importantly to pragmatic inventory management after a glut last year dragged down the entire industry. TSMC’s third-quarter net income beat estimates and its fourth-quarter revenue outlook came in at the top of analysts’ expectations. But the standout headline from the company’s investor conference was its decision to boost its capital expenditure this year by close to 40%. By the end of September it had already shelled out $9.4 billion of the “more than” $11 billion it had previously expected for the full year.That may seem like a brave wager, considering a deepening trade war on two fronts — between the U.S. and China, as well as Japan and South Korea — and President Donald Trump’s campaign against TSMC’s key client, Huawei Technologies Co. Just months ago, shoppers were eschewing futuristic gadgets and putting off smartphone upgrades. But TSMC has rarely made mistakes about how to spend its capex: This plan is not only bold but smart. The world’s biggest chipmaker plans to spend a record-breaking $14 billion to $15 billion this year on the leading-edge equipment it needs to manufacture chips for devices such as Apple Inc. iPhones and Huawei’s smartphones. The company turned more aggressive, CEO C.C. Wei explained, because it sees stronger-than-expected demand for next-generation manufacturing technologies. These chips will be used in smartphones, data centers, IoT devices (think Amazon Alexa) and even cars, he said. Wei said he’s confident that the higher spending will be justified by quicker revenue growth, especially with faster fifth-generation mobile networks and handsets ready to go mainstream in the coming year. Because of the technology involved, 5G networks require more base stations than an equivalent 4G rollout, which will further help semiconductor sales.What should really cheer investors, though, are the figures that often get overlooked, namely inventory. One of the biggest problems afflicting the sector a year ago was that companies — from Apple to PC-chipmaker Intel Corp. and iPhone assembler Foxconn Technology Group — all overshot the mark when it came to buying and building chips, only to be met with lackluster demand from consumers.TSMC’s inventory, measured in Taiwan dollars, fell by 8.2% in the September quarter, the biggest drop in more than two years. Days of inventory — another measure that tracks its stockpiles — dropped to 65 days, the lowest in 18 months. This shows that there’s a smaller risk that TSMC and its clients got ahead of themselves this time. Before celebrating a new dawn for the tech sector, there is a caveat. More sales for TSMC doesn’t necessarily mean more devices being sold to end consumers. That’s because smartphones are becoming even smarter, requiring more chips inside. High-end cameras, for example, require higher-resolution sensors, which in turn means more chips within a phone to manage the power, data and memory that such functionality requires. That said, investors looking for an excuse to jump back into tech shares got exactly what they needed from TSMC.

2019-10-17	2019-10-17 22:00:24	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	TSMC Just Showed Its Chips Are Hot	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Investors looking for signs that the worst is over for the chip sector would be pleased by what Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. served up Thursday. All of its key earnings data point to a rebound in demand, and more importantly to pragmatic inventory management after a glut last year dragged down the entire industry. TSMC’s third-quarter net income beat estimates and its fourth-quarter revenue outlook came in at the top of analysts’ expectations. But the standout headline from the company’s investor conference was its decision to boost its capital expenditure this year by close to 40%. By the end of September it had already shelled out $9.4 billion of the “more than” $11 billion it had previously expected for the full year.That may seem like a brave wager, considering a deepening trade war on two fronts — between the U.S. and China, as well as Japan and South Korea — and President Donald Trump’s campaign against TSMC’s key client, Huawei Technologies Co. Just months ago, shoppers were eschewing futuristic gadgets and putting off smartphone upgrades. But TSMC has rarely made mistakes about how to spend its capex: This plan is not only bold but smart. The world’s biggest chipmaker plans to spend a record-breaking $14 billion to $15 billion this year on the leading-edge equipment it needs to manufacture chips for devices such as Apple Inc. iPhones and Huawei’s smartphones. The company turned more aggressive, CEO C.C. Wei explained, because it sees stronger-than-expected demand for next-generation manufacturing technologies. These chips will be used in smartphones, data centers, IoT devices (think Amazon Alexa) and even cars, he said. Wei said he’s confident that the higher spending will be justified by quicker revenue growth, especially with faster fifth-generation mobile networks and handsets ready to go mainstream in the coming year. Because of the technology involved, 5G networks require more base stations than an equivalent 4G rollout, which will further help semiconductor sales.What should really cheer investors, though, are the figures that often get overlooked, namely inventory. One of the biggest problems afflicting the sector a year ago was that companies — from Apple to PC-chipmaker Intel Corp. and iPhone assembler Foxconn Technology Group — all overshot the mark when it came to buying and building chips, only to be met with lackluster demand from consumers.TSMC’s inventory, measured in Taiwan dollars, fell by 8.2% in the September quarter, the biggest drop in more than two years. Days of inventory — another measure that tracks its stockpiles — dropped to 65 days, the lowest in 18 months. This shows that there’s a smaller risk that TSMC and its clients got ahead of themselves this time. Before celebrating a new dawn for the tech sector, there is a caveat. More sales for TSMC doesn’t necessarily mean more devices being sold to end consumers. That’s because smartphones are becoming even smarter, requiring more chips inside. High-end cameras, for example, require higher-resolution sensors, which in turn means more chips within a phone to manage the power, data and memory that such functionality requires. That said, investors looking for an excuse to jump back into tech shares got exactly what they needed from TSMC. If not signs of stronger demand, evidence of pragmatic inventory management makes it look like a safer sector to place a bet.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2019-10-16	2019-10-16 07:07:56	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Chip Gear-Maker ASML’s Sales Outlook Beats Analyst Estimates	(Bloomberg) -- ASML Holding NV forecast fourth-quarter sales ahead of analysts’ expectations, as Europe’s largest semiconductor equipment maker won orders for 23 more of its newest lithography machines.The Netherlands-based company, which has a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet-lithography equipment, predicts sales of 3.9 billion euros ($4.3 billion) for the fourth quarter, compared with an average estimate of 3.87 billion euros. A year earlier, ASML reported sales of 3.14 billion euros over that quarter.Shares of ASML fell as much as 2.1%. The shares has surged 77% so far this year through Tuesday, making ASML the fourth Dutch company with a market value of more than a 100 billion euros.Key InsightsASML, an important supplier to chip makers including Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., forecasts a gross margin of about 48% to 49% in the fourth quarter of the year, matching the average estimate for 48.8%.The 23 EUV orders in the third quarter contributed to the highest-ever value of bookings in one quarter, said Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink. “This strong order flow confirms the adoption of EUV in high volume manufacturing for Logic and Memory.”Wennink added he expects the Logic business to continue to be strong, driven by the leading-edge nodes supporting end-market technology and applications such as 5G and artificial intelligence, while the timing of the memory industry’s recovery remains uncertain.ASML locked in bookings worth of 5.1 billion euros in the last quarter.Analyst Comment“The order value really pops out, what is impressive amid the trade war and negative impact on electronics,” InsingerGilissen Bankiers analyst Jos Versteeg said by phone, “Such a strong growth does show how confident chip manufacturers are and that they do not want to miss the boat. I think the build-up to 5G leads to a considerable demand for semiconductors.”Know MoreThird-quarter sales came in at 2.99 billion euros, slightly below the average estimate of 3.01 billion euros. In the quarter, ASML shipped seven EUV systems, three of which were NXE:3400C, the higher productivity model.ASML newest machines, called extreme ultraviolet lithography systems or EUV, etch smaller circuits while increasing capacity and speed. EUV machines, about the size of a bus, cost more than 100 million euros each. ASML earns the bulk of its revenue in Asia.ASML models an annual revenue opportunity of 13 billion euros in 2020 and an annual revenue of between 15 billion euros and 24 billion euros through 2025, based on its positive view of technology drivers such as 5G communications, automotive, artificial intelligence and data centers. CEO Wennink said in the statement he continues to see 2019 as a growth year.What Bloomberg Intelligence says:Greater exposure to chip lithography equipment could help ASML achieve strong sales growth from 2020 onward, although sales and profit may temporarily drop in 2019. ASML is well-positioned as the only maker of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, for the next generation of chips for AI and 5G.(Updates with shares, analyst comment.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ellen Proper in Amsterdam at eproper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chip-gear-maker-asml-sales-062408333.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-10	2019-09-10 02:21:23	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Huawei and Samsung’s New 5G Chips Pose Threat to Qualcomm	(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. and Huawei Technologies Co. took turns announcing new mobile processors at the IFA technology show in Berlin last week, and the big thing the new chips have in common is an integrated 5G modem.In a market dominated by U.S. rival Qualcomm Inc., the world’s two biggest smartphone manufacturers asserted a lead in delivering one of the keys to unlocking widespread availability of 5G devices. A system-on-chip that integrates the applications processor and a fifth-generation wireless modem significantly reduces the space and power requirements compared to existing solutions that use two separate chips.Qualcomm has such models on its 2020 road map, but this past week Samsung announced it’s planning mass production for its alternative at the end of 2019 and Huawei is moving even faster, promising to release its most advanced processor with the Mate 30 Pro smartphone on Sept. 19.The Kirin 990 5G from Huawei subsidiary HiSilicon is built at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and packs more than 10.3 billion transistors into a space the size of a fingernail. It includes a graphics processor, an octa-core CPU, and the all-important 5G modem, along with dedicated neural processing units for accelerating artificial intelligence tasks.At Huawei’s Berlin launch event, consumer group Chief Executive Officer Richard Yu showed the high-end 990 5G achieving real-world download speeds on China Mobile’s network in excess of 1.7Gbps. That’s fast enough to download high-definition movies and demanding 3-D games in a matter of seconds.Samsung’s approach with its Exynos 980 is to target the mid-range. Along with 5G capabilities, this new chip integrates 802.11ax fast Wi-Fi along with Samsung’s own NPU. It won’t run apps and games quite as quickly as flagship chips, but should help the South Korean company garner a slice of the more mainstream market before Qualcomm brings out an armada of new 5G-capable chips next year.Samsung’s emphasis on this part of the mobile market was also signaled by its launch of the Galaxy A90 this month, one of the earliest examples of a mid-range device with 5G.Huawei’s Next Flagship Phone Set to Sink Without Google Apps (1)For its part, Qualcomm is promising to cover the entire range of price points and mobile device types with its 5G portfolio in 2020, however the world’s premier mobile chip designer is finding itself behind its faster-moving rivals.While Huawei is “pushing to show tech leadership,” the company has “made sacrifices in order to make an integrated SOC,” said Anshel Sag, mobile industry analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. He cited the chip’s lack of support for mmWave -- the high-frequency 5G favored by U.S. carriers AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. plus some European ones -- as an example. The Kirin 990 5G is fast by today’s standards and a great upgrade for Huawei’s upcoming devices in China, but Sag said it’ll find itself outpaced by rivals in 2020.The silver lining to the trade war for Qualcomm, however, is that Huawei’s Mate 30 Pro will struggle to sell in Europe so long as the Trump administration prevents it from offering Google services on new phones. Irrespective of how fast and advanced its Kirin 990 5G may be, the trade war will prevent Huawei from fully capitalizing on its capabilities and may, in fact, push the company to license the chip out to other smartphone vendors, such as Lenovo Group, which is not subject to the same sanctions.If the U.S. keeps Huawei on its blacklist, preventing it from buying American technology, the company faces further chip challenges. To develop successors to the Kirin 990, it needs to license the latest designs from SoftBank Group’s ARM, but that company discontinued work with Huawei because of the U.S. ban.(Updates with analyst comment in the third from last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Vlad Savov in Tokyo at vsavov5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Nate Lanxon, Peter ElstromFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-samsung-5g-chips-designed-103101109.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-02	2019-09-02 21:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Tiny Japan Firm Helps to Crack Code for Next-Gen Computer Chips	(Bloomberg) -- Chipmakers have spent two decades pouring investment into a revolutionary new technique to push the limits of physics and cram more transistors onto slices of silicon. Now that technology is on the cusp of going mainstream, thanks to a secretive Japanese company that’s mastered the skill of manipulating light for applications from squid fishing to cinema projection.Ushio Inc. announced July it had cleared a key milestone, perfecting the powerful, ultra-precise lights needed to test chip designs based on extreme ultraviolet lithography or EUV, the process through which the next generation of semiconductors will be made. With that, the Japanese company became a major player in future chipmaking.“The infrastructure is now mostly ready,” Chief Executive Officer Koji Naito said in an interview. “Testing equipment was one of the things holding back EUV. With that piece in place, production efficiency and yields can go up.”Read more: How an Obscure Rubber Company Became a Linchpin of Tech IndustryUshio’s advances cement its position among a coterie of little-known Japanese companies indispensable to the production of the world’s consumer electronics. The Tokyo-based company developed a light source for equipment used to test what are known as masks: glass squares slightly bigger than a CD case that act as a stencil for chip designs. These templates have to be absolutely perfect, as even a tiny defect in one of them can render every chip in a large batch unusable.That’s where Ushio comes in. Its technology uses lasers to vaporize liquid tin into plasma and produce light closer in wavelength to X-rays than the spectrum visible to the human eye. That light helps chipmakers spot potential defects in the product. This process takes a room-sized machine that looks like a sci-fi death ray and requires a team of people to operate. After 15 years in development, the EUV business will start contributing to profit from the next fiscal year, Naito said, without giving further details.The move to EUV is the culmination of a decades-old trend. The push for smaller geometries that started when integrated circuits replaced vacuum tubes in the 1970s is approaching its final stages, and the number of companies that can compete in that space has been whittled down to a handful. Only Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have plans to use EUV to go smaller than the 7-nanometer processes that are the current cutting edge of CPU design. All three will use lithography machines from ASML Holding NV, and for a few specialist suppliers like Ushio, that means a chance to have a 100% share of their respective markets.“We don’t chase the mass market, even though there is potentially a ton of money to be made in home lighting or automotive,” Naito said. “Instead, we want to focus on niche areas and do things that others can’t.”Naito believes Ushio is positioned to control the market for light sources used in testing of patterned EUV masks, while a small group of fellow Japanese companies specialize in other aspects of the technology. JSR Corp. and Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Co., for instance, control production of the light-sensitive resins required to print the designs, while the blank masks are made by only two companies, AGC Inc. and Hoya Corp., which both use Lasertec Corp.’s machines to test for flaws. All are based in the greater Tokyo area and espouse an almost artisanal commitment to high-precision manufacturing.Why Japan and South Korea Have Their Own Trade War: QuickTakeThe fact that much of the EUV supply chain hails from a single country was seized upon by Japan in its trade spat with South Korea. Tokyo slapped export restrictions on key materials heading to Korea, giving undesired attention to companies that prefer to operate behind the scenes. While Ushio’s machines were not targeted, photo-resists made by JSR and Tokyo Ohka made the sanctions list. The government has since relented, but concern lingers that the industry’s delicate balance may be again disrupted in the future.“There hasn’t been a direct impact for us yet,” Naito said. “But because we have such a high market share for our products, we feel a responsibility to absolutely make sure our customers’ production lines do not stop.”Alongside its EUV ambitions, Ushio commands an 80% share of the market for lithography lamps used to make liquid crystal displays and controls 95% of the supply of excimer lamps used in silicon wafer cleaning. The key to its success is balancing mass production with craftsmanship. Materials like quartz glass are difficult to handle and have different thermal expansion properties from metals like the molybdenum in which they are housed. Some of the lamps still have to be finished by hand.“Wherever you have a manufacturing process that needs to shine a very bright light, you will find Ushio,” said Damian Thong, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.Ushio’s expertise also extends beyond semiconductors. Founded in 1964, it was the first Japanese company to develop and produce halogen lamps. From 1973, fishermen began to use its lights to catch squid -- -- a controversial technique in many countries. Finding new uses for its technology, from tanning salons to movie projectors, helped Ushio more than triple its sales over the past 25 years. The company is now experimenting with the use of sodium lamps to nurture plants and using ultraviolet light calibrated to such a precise wavelength as to kill bacteria without damaging human skin.“For Japanese firms with strong legacy manufacturing technology, the bigger danger is being trapped in them,” Thong said. “You have to give Ushio credit for moving further downstream, away from manufacturing toward something that requires more system integration.”To contact the reporters on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.net;Yuki Furukawa in Tokyo at yfurukawa13@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiny-japan-firm-helps-crack-210000575.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-26	2019-08-26 21:04:08	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Globalfoundries Sues TSMC; Seeks Import Ban on IPhone Parts	(Bloomberg) -- Globalfoundries Inc. sued larger rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for using its patented chip technology and requested a U.S. trade agency impose import bans that could roil the market for crucial components of a huge swath of electronics, including the iPhone.The U.S.-headquartered chipmaker, which like TSMC manufactures semiconductors for other companies, on Monday filed patent-infringement complaints at the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington, as well as civil lawsuits at federal courts in the U.S. and Germany.The complaints cite TSMC and customers including Apple Inc., Broadcom Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Xilinx Inc., Nvidia Corp. and their device-maker customers including Cisco Systems Inc., Google and Lenovo Group Ltd. TSMC makes chips designed by companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia that are then used in devices including Apple iPhones, Lenovo laptops and Cisco routers.The broad-ranging legal assault threatens to disrupt the supply of everything from smartphones to personal computers to vital infrastructure like switches and routers that are the backbone of the internet. It highlights the importance of TSMC as a maker of the components that keep modern electronics running. It also comes at a time when the worldwide supply chain is being disrupted by a trade dispute between China and the U.S.TSMC spokeswoman Elizabeth Sun said her company hasn’t been served with any court papers and it isn’t familiar with the details of the suit.&quot;TSMC has always respected intellectual property and we have developed all our technologies by ourselves,&quot; Sun said.Globalfoundries is positioning the case as U.S. and European inventions being illegally used by an Asian company that has an increasing stranglehold on crucial parts of the technology industry.“Someone had to do something, the world needs a competitive semiconductor industry,” said Sam Azar, senior vice president of corporate development at Globalfoundries. “We’re using courts in the U.S. and Europe that care about protecting manufacturing.”Globalfoundries has factories in upstate New York and Dresden, Germany. Its headquarters is in Silicon Valley. The closely held company is owned by Mubadala, the investment arm of the government of Abu Dhabi.Globalfoundries, like other so-called contract chipmakers, has struggled to keep pace with TSMC whose factories are now rated the best in the industry. The U.S.-based company is seeking &quot;substantial&quot; damages from its Taiwanese rival which it alleges is using Globalfoundries’ technology to help it win tens of billions of dollars of sales, it said in a statement.German courts work quickly, and are known for ordering a halt of imports of products even before litigation is completed to protect patent owners. The ITC in Washington, which protects U.S. markets from unfair trade practices, also has a reputation for speed, with investigations completed in 15 to 18 months. It has the ability to block products entering the world’s largest economy. It has occasionally opted not to do that if it decides a ban would be counter to the public’s best interest. The American civil suits, filed in federal courts in Delaware and Texas, would take longer but could result in large damage awards.Throughout the complaint, Globalfoundries cited products including iPhones, AirPods, Apple TV and iPad models. It also mentioned Cisco’s switch boxes as using infringing chips and Lenovo computers that are based on Nvidia graphics chips.Globalfoundries argued that a ban would not hurt consumers because Samsung Electronics Co. is a licensee and other companies such as Sony Corp., LG Electronics Inc. and Vizio Inc. are not included in the litigation. That means there will be an adequate supply of smartphones and other consumer electronics, it said in the court filings. Samsung and Globalfoundries had a chipmaking technology partnership.The patents Globalfoundries is asserting cover the fundamentals of how semiconductors are manufactured. Some are U.S. patents and others are European covering esoteric but important areas like “structures of and methods and tools for forming in-situ metallic/dialectric caps for interconnects.” They involve the most advanced technique, called 7 nanometer, that TSMC is currently using.Meanwhile, GlobalFoundries announced a year ago that it would halt development of 7-nanometer chips and focus on more mature technology as the company struggles to match TSMC’s annual capital expenditure of some $11 billion.Globalfoundries’ Azar said his company wants TSMC to stop using the patented technology, which will be difficult to work around, or ask for a license and pay for the right to continue using the inventions.Companies like Apple, Cisco and Nvidia are named in the complaints because TSMC doesn’t import the chips or sell them to consumers; the only way to stop the chips from entering the U.S. and Germany is to block the products that use them.Trump Aides Say He Has Power to Force Companies From China (2)Global Foundries filed the complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a tweet on Aug. 23 saying American companies “are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China.” His administration claims he has the authority to impose such an order though trade experts disagree.(Updates with Samsung and other companies not included in the litigation in 13th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Debby Wu.To contact the reporters on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.net;Susan Decker in Washington at sdecker1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/globalfoundries-sues-tsmc-seeks-import-135137259.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-19	2019-08-19 12:30:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Semiconductor Startup Shows Off the World’s Biggest Processor	(Bloomberg) -- In the semiconductor industry, bigger is not usually better. For 60 years, chip companies have strived to make the brains of computers as tiny as possible.Startup Cerebras Systems will turn this maxim on its head on Monday when it unveils a processor measuring roughly 8 inches by 8 inches. That’s at least 50 times larger than similar chips available today.The logic behind going big is simple, according to founder Andrew Feldman. Artificial intelligence software requires huge amounts of information to improve, so processors need to be as fast as possible to crunch all this data -- even if that means the components get really chunky.The company’s Wafer Scale Engine chip is large because it has 1.2 trillion transistors, 400,000 computing cores and 18 gigabytes of memory. (A typical PC processor will have about 2 billion transistors, four to six cores and a fraction of the memory).“Every square millimeter is optimized for this work,” Feldman said. “AI work is growing like crazy. Our customers are in pain.” The biggest limitation of current AI systems is that it takes too long to train software, he added.Feldman has experience and industry backing that’s essential to tackling an engineering problem of this magnitude, he said. He co-founded server maker SeaMicro Inc. and sold it to chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for more than $300 million in 2012. Cerebras has raised over $100 million from Silicon Valley investors including Benchmark, Andy Bechtolsheim and Sam Altman. Feldman has a team of 174 engineers and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. -- Apple Inc.’s chipmaker of choice -- is manufacturing the massive Cerebras processor.Cerebras won’t sell the chips because it’s so difficult to connect and cool such a huge piece of silicon. Instead, the product will offered as part of a new server that will be installed in data centers. The company said it has test systems working at several large potential customers and will start shipping the machines commercially in October.The AI chip market includes Nvidia Corp., Intel Corp. and U.K. startup Graphcore Ltd. Google has been so keen to speed up AI progress that the internet giant developed its own special chips called Tensor Processing Units.Nvidia was the last company to successfully bring new semiconductor technology into servers, the machines that run data centers that Google, Facebook Inc. and others use to run internet services. Nvidia now gets almost $3 billion a year in revenue from the business, which took years and thousands of engineers to build, according to Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang.“It takes a long time to be successful in data center,” he said in an interview last week.To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/semiconductor-startup-shows-off-world-123000751.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-09	2019-08-09 08:35:28	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	How Huawei Is Trying to Trade War-Proof Its Software	(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. on Friday offered the first glimpse of an in-house software that may someday replace Google’s Android, an important step toward reducing its reliance on American technology.“HarmonyOS,” previously code-named “Hongmeng,” is a long-gestating operating system that could soon find its way into smart TVs and lower-end phones. The OS embodies Huawei’s shift toward self-reliance as American sanctions cut it off from vital technology, and escalating U.S.-Chinese tariffs jeopardize a carefully orchestrated global supply chain. Huawei’s efforts actually mirror Apple Inc.’s: to develop vertically-integrated supply and production lines that help reduce exposure to inclement market forces, unreliable suppliers and unpredictable events like international trade disputes.The newly hostile environment is putting to the test not just Apple’s “Designed in California, Assembled in China” slogan, but the overall preparedness of two smartphone-making giants as the decades-old made-in-China model fractures. Here’s a look at how dependent Apple and Huawei are on external suppliers.OS: Apple’s strength has always been the integration of software with hardware, and it has absolute control over iOS. Huawei is trying to do the same with HarmonyOS, but it has everything left to prove, starting today. For the foreseeable future, Huawei remains dependent on Android for its mainstream smartphones, especially outside China. Advantage: Apple.Software ecosystem: The enormous fortress of iTunes, the App Store and a dedicated following of enthusiastic app developers is a huge and profitable edge for Apple’s mobile business. Huawei will need developers to build valuable apps for its ecosystem, which is another major question mark. Advantage: Apple.Processors: Both design their own processors but neither controls their actual production. Instead, they rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to put them together and on SoftBank Group Corp.’s Arm for the licenses they need to design semiconductors. Advantage: Neither.Memory and storage: SK Hynix Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Micron Technology Inc. anchor the two smartphone makers’ storage needs. The Korean duo have a significant lead on RAM modules. Neither Apple nor Huawei has the capability to produce their own storage chips, though Huawei recently launched the Nano Memory Card. Advantage: Neither.Display: Samsung is the biggest supplier of the organic light-emitting diode displays that Apple uses for its iPhone X and XS top-tier devices. Others such as Japan Display Inc. and LG Display Co. provide liquid-crystal display panels for the likes of the iPhone XR and earlier models. While Huawei is in much the same boat, it’s increasingly relying on home-team vendor BOE Technology Group Co. for its OLED panels, which are starting to win customers beyond China. In short, neither is capable of doing the manufacturing itself. Advantage: Neither.Modems: Essential to mobile connectivity, modems are only going to become more important with the transition to next-generation 5G technology. Apple recently agreed to buy Intel’s modem division, a step toward designing its own 5G chips. But Huawei is already among the leaders on this front, having announced the Balong 5G01 modem in February. As with processors, neither has its own silicon facilities so they’ll again be reliant on specialist foundries. Advantage: Huawei.Assembly: Apple and Huawei are heavily reliant on assemblers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., also known as Foxconn. Both also tap other Taiwanese contract manufacturers -- such as Pegatron Corp., Compal Electronics Inc. and Quanta Computer Inc. -- to varying degrees, while Huawei also relies on Flex Ltd. But unlike Apple, which decided years to outsource much of its global production in China, Huawei operates a few highly automated lines to make top-tier P series phones. Advantage: Huawei.Others: Apple and Huawei rely on a plethora of companies elsewhere in their smartphone production. U.S. companies Skyworks and Qorvo provide radio-frequency modules to facilitate 3G and LTE communications. Dutch semiconductor company NXP is the go-to supplier of NFC parts required for contactless payments. Sony Corp. is the undisputed leader in camera sensors and modules. And Apple-funded Corning Inc. supplies toughened glass. Advantage: Neither.Apple and Huawei appear to be the brains orchestrating a huge, international body of engineering muscle. They design their own software, processors, modems and phones, but ultimately have to hand those plans off to a legion of transnational suppliers and manufacturers.(Updates with OS’s unveiling from first paragraph.)To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Vlad Savov in Tokyo at vsavov5@bloomberg.net;Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-trying-trade-war-proof-210000492.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-06	2019-08-06 13:32:33	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	4 Nanotech Stocks to Watch for Explosive Innovation	[Editor's note: &quot;4 Nanotech Stocks to Watch for Explosive Innovation&quot; was previously published in August 2018. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]Within the broad and rapidly expanding technology sector, nanotechnology offers perhaps the most profound potential impact for society. On a purely scientific level, nanotech involves any innovation conducted at the nanoscale, which is between one to 100 nanometers. As this technology is perfected, it opens up the door to previously impossible mechanisms, making nanotech stocks a must-watch category.But what's behind this innovation? Physicist Richard Feynman, during a lecture in December 1959, introduced the concept that future technologies would enable scientists to &quot;manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules.&quot; Over a decade later, professor Norio Taniguchi coined the term nanotechnology. However, it took substantial advancements in microscopic platforms before scientists could begin practical experimentations.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOnce they did, the positive implications from nanotech integration became readily apparent. According to Nano.gov, 25.4 million nanometers can &quot;fit&quot; inside an inch. A single sheet from a typical newspaper is approximately 100,000 nanometers thick.This tech and its astonishing scale will clearly set the pathway towards the next generation of super-computers. But this innovation reaches much further than that. With the ability to manipulate individual atoms, healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry can finally move beyond researching diseases, and towards their complete elimination.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now Without question, nanotech stocks have the capacity to deliver enormous gains. Here are four examples to keep a close eye on. Nanotech Stocks to Watch: IBM (IBM)Source: Shutterstock I know exactly what you're thinking. With nanotech stocks representing the cutting edge in scientific innovations, why mention a legacy institution like IBM (NYSE:IBM)? It's a fair point. However, IBM is actually synonymous with this innovation. To not include IBM would be a crime against intellectual honesty.Primarily, &quot;Big Blue&quot; invented the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 that allowed researchers unprecedented access to individual atoms and molecules. As Nano.gov confirms, the invention of this highly-specialized microscope catapulted the nanotech industry. Without it, scientists could only theorize about this concept.But what I appreciate about IBM as a viable opportunity among nanotech stocks is its fundamental stability. True, shares haven't performed the way investors would have liked in recent years. But this is a company that we can trust will be around in the next 50 to 100 years.Moreover, management is shifting away from its legacy businesses towards sectors that are relevant today. Whether we're talking nanotech, artificial intelligence or the blockchain, IBM has it covered. Plus, it currently offers a dividend yield of 4.6%. Nanotech Stocks to Watch: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)Source: Shutterstock Semiconductor companies have recently struggled with the harsh realities of Moore's Law. This is &quot;a principle that states gains in CPU performance sharply declines once technology passes a critical maturation point.&quot;Obvious, semiconductors will continue to make strides. However, each dollar invested provides an increasingly smaller performance return. In prior generations, it was thought that a limit could be reached on how small a chip can get.The nanotech industry proved that we still have room to push the dimensional envelope further. As one of the top nanotech stocks within this sector, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is certainly a must-watch name.The challenge with most direct nanotech stocks is that they're incredibly speculative. TSM has a proven history of success. Of course, you pay for that privilege in its current share price, so upside potential is comparatively limited. Still, I like the idea of not getting completely wiped out.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now  Nanotech Stocks to Watch: Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)Source: Shutterstock When discussing nanotech stocks, a tendency exists to focus only on computers and electronics. Though they definitely can advantage the technology's performance and productivity output, they're not the only beneficiaries. With the ability to dive deeper into molecular structures, the biotech industry could likely generate the most meaningful impact.That's why investors should take a long look at Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO). As a medical diagnostics and research specialist, Thermo Fisher provides biotech and healthcare firms of all sizes with necessary equipment. As nanotech concepts increasingly transition from theory into reality, TMO is on the ground floor distributing these applied-science products.Better yet, TMO is an established, stable investment. On a year-to-date basis, TMO stock has gained 20%. Over the trailing five years, shares have returned over 100%. As with the other industry stalwarts, you pay for the privilege. But Thermo Fisher is unlikely to leave you hanging. Nanotech Stocks to Watch: Nanometrics (NANO)Source: Shutterstock Smaller, more powerful semiconductors and related electronic devices are only part of the nanotech story. At some point, we need companies that can drill down into the minutiae to perform assessment and quality-control operations. This is where Nanometrics (NASDAQ:NANO) comes into play.As a specialist in metrology, or the scientific study of measurements, Nanometrics develops the components used in semiconductor and solid-state device fabrication. Their platforms also dramatically improve manufacturing productivity while maintaining accuracy and precision.Sentiment has improved dramatically this year after some choppy performances in years past. NANO stock is up over 67% since January's opener.Those who are looking for a discounted opportunity may be somewhat disappointed with NANO's dramatic rise. However, the lift is fundamentally justified. Nanometrics features an exceptionally robust balance sheet, with highlights being zero debt and steadily rising cash. That gives management an extra cushion for future product investments.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now Furthermore, NANO maintains strong profitability margins and above-average revenue growth. Recent outperformance in sales suggests more upside remaining for NANO stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-01	2019-08-01 21:00:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Signs of an End to the Tech Slump Offer Hope to Asia’s Economies	(Bloomberg) -- The worst may soon be over for an electronics slump that has dogged Asia’s export-driven economies.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists said a rebound in technology exports is overdue, citing gradual improvement in South Korean trade and evidence the memory-chip cycle is reaching its low point.While South Korean semiconductor shipments plunged 28% by value in July, they rose 15% by volume. The nation’s inventories of semiconductors fell a second straight month in June, a sign that orders are picking up.“The question is when South Korea’s exports will bottom out,” said Stephen Lee, an economist at Meritz Securities Co. in Seoul. “It could be the third quarter, either August or September.”The slump in tech exports has been one of the biggest drags on Asia’s manufacturing base. Key gauges for factory sentiment continue to show contractions for output in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan. Real investment growth across Asia slowed to 2% in the first quarter from 7% a year ago, according to S&P Global Ratings.Industry announcements across Asia signal a possible recovery, which is good news for a region that accounts for more than 60% of global economic growth.Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s biggest memory-chip maker, said Wednesday that data centers -- its biggest customers -- have started buying again, causing demand to increase.The world’s largest contract chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., surprised analysts last month when it projected current-quarter revenue ahead of estimates. TSMC’s business has bottomed out and should begin to rebound, Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said. The Apple Inc. supplier sees “very, very strong demand” in the second half of 2019, he said.Smartphone DemandApple’s suppliers -- dominated by Asia-based factories -- are preparing to produce components for up to 75 million new iPhones in the second half, roughly the same number as a year earlier, Bloomberg News reported.Apple’s sales forecast of $61 billion-$64 billion for the current quarter not only topped analysts’ estimates but also signaled year-over-year revenue could grow, thanks to healthy demand for iPhones.Another reason for optimism is that Samsung will begin selling its Galaxy Fold smartphone in September. The world’s biggest handset maker hopes the foldable phones, coupled with fifth-generation wireless networks, will kick the mobile industry back into a boom by giving consumers a compelling reason to upgrade their devices.“It’s been pretty awful but probably not as bleak going forward as it has been,” Sian Fenner, lead Asia economist at Oxford Economics, said of the tech cycle.Early DaysFor sure, it’s too early to say for certain the worst is over.After all, Singapore’s electronics exports fell in June to their lowest since at least 1997. In Japan, shipments of electronic components and chip-making equipment to China both dropped by well over 20% in June.Tuuli McCully, head of Asia-Pacific economics at Scotiabank in Singapore, said that while the electronics sector may bottom late this year, “significant downside risks remain.”In addition to the U.S.-China trade war and a slowing global economy, demand for new smartphones is plateauing. Rising tensions between Japan and South Korea could also hurt. Japan has already slapped curbs on exports to South Korea of materials vital to manufacturing of semiconductors and displays, and things could get worse.“Even before the trade war hit, there was a bit of a moderation in the tech cycle,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. “Smartphones have reached a saturation point.”Still, optimists argue that comparisons with robust growth numbers for electronics exports from a year ago is making the weakness look worse than it is.Beyond smartphones, Asia is also leading spending on the Internet of Things, accounting for around 36% of global spending this year, followed by the U.S. and Western Europe with 27% and 21%, respectively.“Initial shocks from the trade war might be behind us,” Goldman economists wrote in a note.&#92;--With assistance from Debby Wu.To contact the reporters on this story: Enda Curran in Hong Kong at ecurran8@bloomberg.net;Michelle Jamrisko in Singapore at mjamrisko@bloomberg.net;Sam Kim in Seoul at skim609@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Malcolm Scott at mscott23@bloomberg.net, Henry Hoenig, Nasreen SeriaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/signs-end-tech-slump-offer-210000376.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-08-01	2019-08-01 18:12:48	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Advanced Micro Devices: Playing for Scale	Before Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) released second-quarter earnings on July 30, I fretted.A strong quarter was expected but already priced in, I wrote. I called AMD's valuation difficult to justify.Sure enough the numbers, earnings of $35 million, 3 cents per share, on revenue of $1.53 billion, sent the stock skidding 10%, even before the market re-opened on July 31. AMD share price of about $30.50 per share was due to open August 1.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAMD took its investors on an exciting ride over the last few years, from $2 per share in 2015 to its most recent highs of $34, on the strength of its beating Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in microprocessors with its Ryzen designs.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 But it's time to take AMD seriously, as a potential long-term holding and not just a trade. How does it measure up? AMD Stock Still Too SmallAMD has beaten Intel on the most public stages in the market, on desktop PCs, which have recently gotten their mojo back.But in the cloud, AMD doesn't offer the scale and pricing Intel does. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is rumored to be looking at AMD EPYC chips for its servers but, so far, that's just a rumor. At the present time, AMD's share of the server chip market hovers around 3%. Its desktop and laptop market share averages 15%. While AMD has boosted its quality against Intel, thanks in part to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), which can get circuit lines 7 nanometers (nm) apart while Intel is still struggling with 10 nm, it remains too small to deliver orders to the scale companies like Google need. Thus the Intel monopoly remains largely intact.In its other niche, graphics processors, AMD must fight Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) the way it once fought Intel on price. Nvidia's market share in discrete processors hovers between 75%-80%. In the broader graphics market Intel still has 66% of the sales, although it was 75% a few years ago. Where AMD is gaining share in graphics, it's usually at Intel's expense, not Nvidia's.Where AMD has prospered is in the flashy front of the market, on devices bought by individuals, rather than in the meaty heart of the market, in clouds and servers. In gaming, AMD is the value choice, as it was once the value choice against Intel in PCs. Advanced Micro Devices Is Up Against the CzarsNvidia really takes AMD down in the cloud.With a market cap of almost $103 billion, three times that of AMD, and twice its sales, Nvidia can compete here, especially with its $6.9 billion acquisition of Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX), which has yet to close. Nvidia is also way ahead in the &quot;sexy&quot; part of the cloud, in deep learning and artificial intelligence software. Nvidia is much closer to big cloud orders than AMD. Here, chip makers must compete with one another and with the efforts of the Cloud Czars themselves. Nvidia graphics processors still hold a leadership position against Google's Tensor chips.Hardware is becoming software, and in this new world the Cloud Czars have everyone outgunned. AMD makes some nice cloud chips but, at its present size, they'll never be more than niche offerings. The Bottom Line on AMD StockIn the 2020s it will take more than great design for a chipmaker to prosper. It will take scale, and a wide product line that includes software.Despite its weaknesses Intel still has the scale to compete in this new world. Nvidia is acquiring it. It may be too late for AMD to get there before the Cloud Czars take over the chip world.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-31	2019-07-31 00:18:54	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	AMD Sales Forecast Misses on Tepid Game-Console Chip Demand	(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc., the No. 2 maker of computer processors, gave a disappointing third-quarter sales forecast, indicating lower-than-expected orders for game-console chips from Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp., two of its biggest customers.Revenue in the current period will be about $1.8 billion, Santa Clara, California-based AMD said Tuesday in a statement. That missed the average of analysts’ projections of $1.94 billion, according to a survey by Bloomberg. The company also pared its forecast for annual revenue, and shares tumbled in extended trading.Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su is trying to remake her company into more than just a purveyor of cut-price alternatives to Intel Corp.’s PC chips. While sales of PC-related products are improving, the company said revenue is taking a hit because demand from game-console makers is falling short of its original forecasts this year. In the second quarter, revenue in the division that includes server processors and custom chips for consoles declined 12%, AMD said.Console sales are dropping as the current versions of Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation are in their seventh year of life and the companies have started talking about their replacements.Su, the chip industry’s first female chief executive officer, said her company is where she had hoped it would be in terms of unveiling competitive chips, and AMD is ready to take back share from Intel, whose products still garner 90% of revenue in the processor market. As the year progresses, she said, more of AMD’s recently announced chips will be available in electronic devices, boosting the company’s market footprint.“There’s a real pull for the products,” Su said. “I feel really good about the customer engagements.”The company’s second-quarter net income fell to $35 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with $116 million, or 11 cents, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, profit in the recent period was 8 cents, matching analyst predictions. Revenue in the period was $1.53 billion, 13% lower than a year earlier but topping analysts’ average projection of $1.52 billion.Gross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, widened to 41% in the second quarter, in line with the average analyst estimate. A year earlier, that measure of profitability came in at 37%.AMD said it now expects full-year revenue to gain at a percentage in the mid-single digits, compared with an earlier prediction for annual sales to rise in the high single digits. Analysts had projected an annual sales increase of about 6%. At the same time, the company slightly raised its forecast for gross margin for all of 2019, to 42%.The company’s shares fell about 5% in extended trading following the report, after earlier climbing 1.2% to $33.87 at the close in New York. The stock has been on a tear this year, gaining 83% so far.Last week, Intel gave an upbeat forecast and said second-quarter demand had exceeded its earlier outlook. Buyers of computer components stocked up ahead of the potential for tariffs to be levied on trade between the U.S. and China, Intel said. Still, executives warned that the temporary boost can’t be expected to continue. Demand for servers from corporations and government agencies was weak, particularly in China.Under Su, AMD has been staging a comeback in the lucrative business of chips for servers, machines that are the backbone of corporate networks and the internet. The company owned about a quarter of that market a decade ago, until delays to new chips and lagging performance allowed Intel to banish AMD to less than 1% market share. AMD’s new Epyc range of server processors is aimed at clawing back those lost orders.AMD is also trying to exploit Intel’s delays in shifting production to more advanced technology. AMD now outsources manufacturing of its best chips to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which analysts calculate is now more than a year ahead of Intel in implementing new processes.Su’s efforts have had an impact. At the end of last year, AMD had 3.2% of the market for server chips, up from 0.8% 12 months earlier. AMD has made faster progress in laptops and desktop computers, where it has more than 10% share of shipments, according to Mercury Research.(Updates with CEO comment in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Dan ReichlFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-sales-forecast-misses-tepid-211128665.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-25	2019-07-25 06:18:38	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Suppliers See Demand for New IPhones Stabilizing This Year	(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s suppliers are preparing to produce components for up to 75 million new iPhones in 2019’s second half, roughly the same number as a year earlier, according to people familiar with the matter.The volumes planned for the next iPhone launch cycle would signal steady demand for the company’s most important product, despite U.S.-China trade tensions and a decline in the overall smartphone market. The Cupertino, California-based technology giant stopped divulging iPhone shipment numbers in the holiday quarter last year as unit growth turned negative and started providing metrics to highlight the growth of services such as Apple Music. Analysts estimate Apple sold 70 million to 80 million new iPhones in the second half of last year.The company’s Asian suppliers are gearing up to produce components for three new iPhone models to meet holiday-season demand, the people said, asking not to be identified citing internal estimates. The U.S. company’s Asian partners could ramp production up to 80 million new phones if needed, one of the people said. Main iPhone assembler Foxconn Technology Group has stepped up hiring in Shenzhen and is offering staff about 10% more than a year ago to secure a peak-period workforce, another person familiar with the matter said.The iPhone assembler Pegatron Corp. added to gains and closed 2.3% higher, while lens maker Largan Precision Co. rose 2.6%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. pared earlier losses and closed unchanged.Apple has announced new iPhones each September since 2012 and the new models typically go on sale in the final weeks of that month. The company reports third quarter earnings on July 30, and the firm’s guidance could indicate its expectations for iPhone sales at the end of the fourth quarter ending in September. Apple still provides iPhone revenue figures, with the company generating $52 billion from iPhones last holiday quarter, a 15% decline, and $37 billion from new iPhones in the last fourth quarter, a 27% increase. Those numbers, however, include a mix of both last year’s new models and earlier versions of the iPhone.Jeff Pu at GF Securities estimates that shipments of newly released iPhones will rise to 74 million in the second half, up about 7% from his estimate of 69 million last year, while TF International analyst Ming-Chi Kuo forecast that Apple would sell 75 million to 80 million new iPhones in the second half of 2018. This year’s volumes may signal stabilization after a year of uncertainty, though that’s a far cry from the double-digit growth numbers of years past.Of course, the fact that Apple suppliers plan to produce parts for 75 million new iPhones doesn’t necessarily mean the company will sell that many. Apple will assess sales after launch and the total shipments may not reach that mark. The company declined to comment.Apple is struggling with soft smartphone demand as people take longer to replace their gadgets and Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies Co. grab market share. The trade war is also denting Chinese economic growth while souring consumers there on American brands. Analysts have been betting on a 13.3% drop in iPhone shipments to roughly 189 million in fiscal 2019, according to average projections compiled by Bloomberg.“Apple’s growth has become more cyclical and slowed along with the global smartphone market, leaving it dependent on iPhone upgrades to drive sales,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts John Butler and Boyoung Kim said. “Apple’s inability to raise iPhone prices much higher is constraining growth. Weakness in China due to competition and the trade war with the U.S. remains an issue.”While Apple is relying on services to take up the slack, sales of the gadget remain its largest revenue driver and the U.S. company needs to get the latest devices into the hands of its users so they can actually download and subscribe to new services like the upcoming Apple Card, Apple Arcade gaming service, and Apple TV+, a Netflix rival.The major attraction in this year’s models lies in enhanced cameras: the two high-end models to replace the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max will include three back cameras, up from two, and a successor to the iPhone XR will include a second back camera. The third camera will serve as an additional ultra-wide lens, Bloomberg News reported in January, allowing the phone to automatically repair parts of an image that may be initially chopped out of a frame. It will also enable a wider range of zoom. All three new models will also include faster A13 processors built by TSMC, Bloomberg News reported in May.Beyond the additional rear cameras, the new iPhone models will look similar to the 2018 versions, which looked like the 2017 iPhone X. Apple is planning a more extensive revamp of the iPhone with an updated design, 5G connectivity, and new augmented reality cameras for 2020, Bloomberg has also reported.Read more: Apple’s 2019 and 2020 iPhone and iPad PlansWall Street sentiment on Apple may be starting to brighten somewhat after a prolonged period of investor-pessimism. Morgan Stanley boosted its target price on the stock this week, days after another firm upgraded the shares. Apple may benefit from a U.S. ban on the sale of American technology to Huawei, not to mention Japanese exports curbs to Korea that threaten Samsung Electronics Co. Apple’s main chipmaking partner, TSMC, also helped allay fears of a protracted industry slump when it projected current-quarter revenue ahead of estimates. Longer term, investors hope Apple can rejuvenate its most iconic gadget.(Add share price changes in fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.net;Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.net;Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Peter ElstromFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-suppliers-see-demand-iphones-030811198.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-18	2019-07-18 08:15:11	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Apple Chip Supplier’s Solid Performance Shows Resilience in Trade Fight	(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected current-quarter revenue ahead of estimates, as the Apple Inc. supplier shrugs off a smartphone slump and U.S. sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co. to ride demand for cutting-edge chips.The world’s largest contract chipmaker expects sales of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion in the September quarter, ahead of average projections for about $8.9 billion. The Taiwanese company earlier reported a fall in June-quarter net income to NT$66.8 billion ($2.1 billion), surpassing the NT$65.7 billion estimated.TSMC’s solid outlook may allay fears of a persistent global chip downturn as Washington and Beijing clash. Its technological edge in chipmaking may help it grab an outsized portion of demand for advanced high-performance semiconductors, particularly as countries roll out ultra-fast fifth generation wireless networks. TSMC’s business has bottomed and should begin to rebound, Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said.“We have passed the bottom of the cycle of our business, and should see our demand increase,” he told reporters in Taipei Thursday. “We see very, very strong demand” in the second half of 2019.Click here to read a liveblog of TSMC’s post-announcement briefingOrders for crypto-mining gear are expected to help TSMC’s third-quarter sales, according to Morgan Stanley, which recently lifted its target price on the stock by 9%. The typical year-end ramp up of iPhone manufacturing and a new chip-product cycle from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. could also buoy the top line.“The guidance shows that management is confident on the recovery of demand in 2H, possibly boosted by new orders from AMD,” Bloomberg Intelligence Charles Shum said. “And, we expect the gross margin can return to 50%” by the fourth quarter.TSMC and its industry peers are grappling with a plateauing smartphone market, efforts by top customer Apple to move beyond hardware, and U.S. tech-export curbs that have hammered No. 2 customer Huawei. It previously reported a 4.5% slide in first-half revenue -- its worst January-to-June performance since 2011.While top executives expressed confidence that things are turning around, they warned of uncertainty springing from global trade tensions. Japan’s curbs on the export to South Korea of certain vital chipmaking materials could hammer industry players like Samsung Electronics Co., and further depress global smartphone demand.“The recent Japan-Korea dispute is probably the most uncertain” factor for TSMC’s fourth quarter, Chairman Mark Liu said.As the world’s largest player in the business of made-to-order chips, TSMC is a barometer for the broader industry as well as Apple, which accounts for about a fifth of its revenue. While uncertainty remains, its better-than-projected outlook underscores expectations the industry is bottoming out after a dismal few years, when consumers took longer to replace their smartphones and Bitcoin prices collapsed.The company on Thursday signaled its intention to invest for the future, saying its spending on capacity and upgrades could exceed $11 billion this year.TSMC’s shares stood largely unchanged before the announcement and have gained more than 12% this year.(Updates with commentary around Japan and Korea from the 7th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Gao Yuan, Sheryl Tian Tong Lee and Adela Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-chip-supplier-solid-performance-053531941.html?.tsrc=rss

The world's largest contract chipmaker reported a decline in second-quarter profit, but said demand is likely to recover during the rest of 2019 particularly from smartphone makers, hampered at present by the impact of a Sino-U.S. trade war.

At stake is the stock’s $35 billion rebound in market value since a January low.Apple Inc.’s ramp up of iPhone manufacturing and a new product cycle from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. are seen by Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts to lift sales, which would also be boosted if President Donald Trump loosens trade restrictions on key customer Huawei Technologies Co.TSMC’s Sales May Swing Back to Growth on Huawei Orders: ReactAnalysts have forecast sales in the period to grow 15% from a quarter earlier, according to the average of 22 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s shares are up 12% this year, despite being whipsawed as the trade war escalated. They edged 0.6% higher Thursday morning.“The company’s second-half outlook looks to be improving, and third-quarter guidance will probably be strong given that some of the lingering uncertainty has started to fade,” said John Tsai, portfolio manager at Eastspring Investments Ltd. in Singapore. The trade spat between Japan and South Korea may also help TSMC, as Samsung Electronics Co. customers such as Qualcomm Inc. may seek to diversify, he added.TSMC saw sales drop 4.5% year-on-year in the first half, its worst performance since 2011. The company was grappling with the impact of a slowing global smartphone market and efforts by its biggest customer Apple to move beyond hardware. Then the trade war escalated into the U.S. blacklisting Huawei, TSMC’s second-largest customer.Yet its leading position in advanced technology, especially in 5G and artificial intelligence, helped it secure revenue. Chip orders for crypto mining are also expected to help TSMC’s third-quarter sales, according to Morgan Stanley, which recently lifted its target price on the stock by 9%.TSMC investors will also receive a NT$207 billion ($6.7 billion) dividend payout Thursday, according to stock exchange and company statements. The company is aiming for a dividend per share of at least NT$10 to lure value investors, something Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts Robin Cheng and Mike Yang see as possible in 2020. They argue that rising free cash flow justifies a re-rating of the stock.Here are some highlights of 3Q 2019 estimates:Gross margin: 48.3% (19 estimates)Revenue: NT$276.6b (22 estimates)Net income (GAAP): NT$96.04b (20 estimates)Operating profit: NT$103.5b (15 estimates)Timing: release after market July 18(Updates prices.)To contact the reporters on this story: Cindy Wang in Taipei at hwang61@bloomberg.net;Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sofia Horta e Costa at shortaecosta@bloomberg.net, David Watkins, Philip GlamannFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-counts-iphones-revival-trade-210000925.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-17	2019-07-17 16:50:16	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	One Chipmaker May Tell ETF Traders Everything About Earnings	(Bloomberg) -- Exchange-traded fund investors have a lot riding on earnings from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. this Thursday.Almost 90% of the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF and the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF -- the two largest semiconductor ETFs -- is in some way connected to the company, known as TSMC, according to Bloomberg supply-chain data. Semiconductor equipment suppliers like ASML Holding NV, Applied Materials Inc., and KLA Corp. all derived more than 10% of their revenue from TSMC in the previous quarter, the data show.For example, about 15% of Applied Materials’ fiscal second-quarter revenue came from its relationship with TSMC. Applied Materials has about a 4% weight in both the SOXX and SMH funds.Most major semiconductor companies don’t make the chips themselves. Instead, they will design them and outsource production to another company, like TSMC. TSMC is the world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips.TSMC “is unequivocally critical to the industry” and its earnings forecast will be closely watched by investors, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anand Srinivasan. “Guidance is critical and color for the second half -- especially for smartphone chips -- may set the tone for how chip vendors are planning supply in anticipation of demand.”Performance of semiconductor stocks has been highly volatile so far in 2019, with swings of more than 10% up or down in four of the past six months, much more volatile than the S&P 500, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. After a wave of optimism that drove stocks to record highs this spring, investors have been growing increasingly skeptical that demand, pricing and inventory levels will improve in the second half of this year.&#92;--With assistance from Tom Lagerman.To contact the reporter on this story: Carolina Wilson in New York City at cwilson166@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Rachel EvansFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chipmaker-may-tell-etf-165016891.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-09	2019-07-09 02:38:05	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Japan-Korea Spat Threatens to Upend Global Technology Chain	(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. Resurgent tensions between Japan and South Korea threaten to wallop chipmakers from Samsung Electronics Co. to SK Hynix Inc., upsetting a carefully choreographed global supply chain by smothering the production of memory chips and other components vital to widely used devices.As the world fixates on Donald Trump’s campaign to contain Huawei Technologies Co. and China’s ambitions, a concurrent dispute between Beijing’s two richest neighbors also has far-reaching implications for the production of everything from Apple Inc. iPhones to Dell Technologies Inc. laptops. The industry is now scrambling to gauge the fallout after Japan -- citing longstanding and unresolved tensions -- slapped restrictions on exports to Korea of three classes of materials crucial to the production of semiconductors and cutting-edge screens.That maneuver, the most recent manifestation of decades of war-time tensions, places Samsung at the center of a firestorm and again underscores the global nature of the production machine that cranks out most of the world’s gadgets. Not only does it make memory chips, but Samsung is also the biggest producer of smartphones.Korea’s largest company has lost about 16 trillion won ($13 billion) in market value this month through Monday, while Hynix has shed 1.5 trillion won. The two companies -- which together account for 60% of the world’s memory chip-making capacity -- declined to comment.While inventory levels differ across each material, Samsung has under a month’s worth of supply on average, according to people familiar with the matter. Samsung and SK Hynix are busily sourcing alternatives, the people said, asking not to be identified talking about a sensitive political issue. The two Korean giants assured clients they would try to minimize the impact on output, but Samsung, for one, is bracing for potential production cuts or even stoppages should the situation persist, the people said.That’s why the Korean conglomerate’s de facto leader, Jay Y. Lee, hopped on a jet to Tokyo over the weekend for emergency meetings with Japanese suppliers. It’s unclear how deeply felt the impact might be -- much depends on whether Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-In can work out a compromise. But in a worst-case scenario, flexible screens for iPhones and other mobile devices could sputter, while memory chips used in everything from HP Inc. notebooks to Amazon.com Inc. servers could dwindle.“This is an unprecedented event,” said Jongjun Won, chief executive officer at Lime Asset Management Co. “If it’s lucky, the chip industry may be able to adjust inventories. There could be a happy ending if the Japan issue gets resolved in the meantime. However, the intertwining of politics and business is making it difficult to find a solution.”The dispute has spilled over into social media. South Koreans, angered by Japan’s move, have taken to Instagram and other platforms to call for boycotts of Japanese travel and consumer products.Japan’s targeting a trio of materials that, while little-known outside of the industry, is profoundly important for electronics production. The government says they also have sensitive military applications. Within the tech sector, fluorinated polyimide is required for the production of foldable panels -- such as those used in Samsung’s Galaxy Fold -- among other things. Photo-resists are key to chipmaking, while hydrogen fluoride is needed for both chip and display production.Finding substitutes won’t be easy: Korean corporations now depend on Japan for over 90% of all the fluorinated polyimide and resists it needs, and 44% of its hydrogen fluoride requirements, Societe Generale estimates. Ironically, if the dispute drags on, Japanese suppliers of those chemicals -- companies from JSR Corp. to Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. that comprise a small but inextricable link in the chain -- could take a hit as well.“This could be a negative factor for the world economy,” Huh Nam-Kwon, CEO at Shinyoung Asset Management Co, said by phone. “All we need to do is wait and see how the situation goes. Just one word from Abe could decide anything. It’s hard to predict.”The most significant impact will be on Samsung’s next-generation products: foldable displays as well as chips of 7 nanometer line-widths or less that’re made via the so-called extreme ultra-violet (EUV) process. That puts at risk Samsung’s express goal of investing $116 billion to become the No.1 in the logic chip business by 2030. Without Japan’s materials, Samsung may be hamstrung in efforts to develop an EUV-based foundry business and in advanced memory chipmaking.Their rivals may step in to fill that gap in the interim. Micron Technology Inc., the only other memory chip maker of significance, stands to benefit. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. could further widen its lead over Samsung when it comes to made-to-order chips, vying for Samsung customers like Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp.“There will be considerable impact on both sides,” said Heungchong Kim, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy. “Those materials are not something that can be replaced in a short period. This is becoming a weird situation.”The situation may worsen if Japan removes South Korea from a so-called “White List” of countries treated as presenting no risk of weapons proliferation, a move Tokyo is now considering.Japan and Korea have traditionally turned to the U.S. to mediate in their clashes, but it’s unclear this time if Trump is keen to step into the fray. Compounding the situation are the basic mechanics of the restrictions. While not a ban per se, would-be exporters of the affected materials need to obtain a license from the government. That could take up to 90 days -- an eternity for a fast-moving industry.There’s also disagreement by industry analysts over which corporations exactly will get hit hardest, in part because some Japanese firms have either localized production in South Korea or maintain plants in countries such as China.“In the near-term, we do not expect Korean companies’ major customers to move to other component vendors due to high switching costs and long qualification process times,” said J.J. Park, head of Korean equity research at JP Morgan. But “if there is a bottleneck due to a shortage of key materials resulting from Japan’s curb on export of materials, we can’t rule out potential market-share loss to their peers.”Japan’s Sumitomo Chemical Co. is a key supplier of polyimides, according to Taipei-based WitsView and Isaiah Research -- but company representatives deny it makes the material. IHS Markit analyst David Hsieh said in addition to Sumitomo Chemical, SKC -- like Hynix, an affiliate of the giant SK Group -- or Kolon Industries are viable local substitutes.JSR is a major resist producer, while the global hydrogen fluoride market is dominated by Kanto Denka Kogyo Co., Showa Denko KK and Daikin Industries Ltd., according to Taipei-based Isaiah Research. Resist manufacturer Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Co. said it already supplies South Korean customers locally. Daikin said the restrictions will have no impact on its hydrogen fluoride because the materials are made in China, while Morita Chemical Industries Co. is building a plant there that will go online next year.“While high levels of semiconductor inventory might provide some cushion, time may not be on Korea’s side,” Citigroup economists Jin-Wook Kim and Johanna Chua said in a recent note. “Displacing Korean chips would disrupt the supply chain because building alternative sources needs specific technology and sizable capex.”(Updates with analyst’s comments from the 18th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Heejin Kim, Yuki Furukawa and Isabel Reynolds.To contact the reporters on this story: Sohee Kim in Seoul at skim847@bloomberg.net;Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.net;Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japan-korea-spat-threatens-upend-093238145.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-05	2019-07-05 13:16:30	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	3 Reasons to Take a Shot at Nvidia Stock Now	The past nine months have been nothing less than miserable for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Since peaking near $293 per share in October of last year, Nvidia stock price has dropped to a low of $124.46, and its couple of rebound efforts in the meantime have been less than permanent.Source: Shutterstock The current Nvidia stock price near $163 is still just over half of what it was less than a year ago.Certainly the underpinnings of NVDA's weakness are understandable. They include the rebirth of rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), the implosion of the cryptocurrency mining industry and a tariff war with China, all of which are still key factors weighing on investors' minds.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Dividend Stocks to Buy From Across the Globe The degree of the punishment doesn't fit the scope of the crime, however, and three recent developments may well prove to be the excuse sidelined bulls are waiting for to file back into NVDA. RTX Super CardsWhether it's by design or just a simple coincidence is unclear, but the two big graphics processing powerhouses -- AMD and Nvidia -- rarely launch new products at the same time.That dynamic let Advanced Micro Devices steal some graphics processing unit (GPU) market share last quarter, driven by purchases of AMD's then-new 7 nanometer Radeon VII as well as its updated Polaris family.NVDA appears to have only been biding its time, however. The company's new GeForce RTX 2070 Super and GeForce RTX 2060 Super graphics cards, launching this month, deliver more power at the same price AMD is charging for its most comparable discreet GPUs.The current quarter could be better than expected for NVDA. Getting a Cheap Price From SamsungRather than tapping Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) as the manufacturer of its Ampere GPUs slated to debut in 2020, NVDA has asked Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) to handle the load. That may mean little on the surface to the layperson, but to technophiles, it matters.Details of the deal are scant, but most credible rumors seem to suggest that Samsung offered Nvidia a price it couldn't refuse. Either NVDA will enjoy wide margins on the GPUs or it will be able to pass those savings along to customers.It's often a risky move to switch suppliers and contracted manufacturers. Samsung has done similar work for NVDA in the past, though, and the Korean firm isn't exactly an unknown name in the business. MellanoxFinally, in March of this year, Nvidia announced that it intended to buy Israel's Mellanox Technologies (NASDAQ:MLNX), which makes internet switches and adapters, offering $6.9 billion in cash for the company.China, however, could still scuttle the deal.Chinese regulators could claim the pairing violates its antitrust standards. It's a stretched argument, but that scenario could still play out And, given the trade war tensions in place now,  Beijing could easily run such interference for purely political reasons.Following a relatively amicable G20 summit that ended in an agreement to at least not impose any new tariffs on trade between China and the United States, however, China may choose to offer another olive branch by not impeding the acquisition.Mellanox would provide Nvidia with an even stronger hold on the data center market. The Bottom Line on NVDA StockDon't kid yourself. For better or worse,rhetoric and perception has done most of the damage to Nvidia stock, and it's a change in the rhetoric and perception that will lift Nvidia stock price again. This is, as much as anything else, a psychological situation.None of  the three aforementioned developments is earth-shattering, but all are high-visibility developments that can quickly improve sentiment towards Nvidia stock, setting the stage for a sizable rebound.But there's still the impasse with China, which supplies Nvidia with half of its revenue. Even with no new tariffs being established, existing ones remain in place. There's little doubt that NVDA has felt their impact.Eventually, however, the tariffs will be rescinded or Nvidia will figure out a way to adapt to them. The deeper dive into data centers is one such adaptation. Switching production of its GPU to Samsung is another.Meanwhile,analysts' average price target for Nvidia stock is about $182; the most bullish analyst has a $225 price target on the name. Though those are forward-looking targets on NVDA, the company's got enough fresh firepower in its arsenal to justify prices somewhere between those two figures.It increasingly looks like investors are starting to recognize that reality, too.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-01	2019-07-01 14:55:26	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Applied Materials to Buy Kokusai From KKR for $2.2 Billion	(Bloomberg) -- Applied Materials Inc., one of the largest makers of machines used to make semiconductors, agreed to buy Kokusai Electric from KKR & Co. in a deal worth about 250 billion yen ($2.2 billion).Kokusai Electric will operate as a business unit of Applied’s semiconductor products group and continue to be based in Tokyo, according to a statement Monday.The deal is expected to close within 12 months, and Applied Materials is to finance the transaction using a combination of balance sheet cash and a term loan facility, the statement added.Applied Materials shares gained 3.9% at 10:44 a.m. in New York Monday.California-based Applied Materials dominates the market for equipment involved in the early stages of turning wafers of silicon into computer chips. Its main customers are Samsung Electronics Co., Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Applied Materials went on a sales-growth spurt under Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson as chipmakers ordered more machinery to help solve the increasing complexity of semiconductors.Investment firm KKR bought the Japanese mobile phone and wireless equipment manufacturer, a former Hitachi Ltd. unit, in a tender offer in 2017. Before the deal closed, KKR made a bid that valued Kokusai Electric at $3 billion yen, although it’s not clear how much KKR ultimately paid.Kokusai focuses on batch processing, or processing many wafers in parallel, particularly for memory wafers. Its key customers include Samsung Electronics Co., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., and Intel Corp., according to a presentation.The deal will expand Applied’s Asia footprint, Dickerson said on the investor call, adding that Kokusai currently has an install base of 10,000 systems. Kokusai’s revenue for 2019 is estimated at $1.5 billion based on international accounting standards.The $470 billion chip-making industry has been consolidating rapidly over the past half-decade, putting pressure on suppliers like Applied Materials to bulk up in turn.Applied Materials sought to merge with Tokyo Electron in 2015, but the deal was scrapped amid opposition from the U.S. Department of Justice. Dickerson had planned to move to Japan to run the combined company.The proposed deal by Applied Materials to buy Kokusai Electric is also likely to face scrutiny from regulators. The transaction will need approval from six, including those in China, Applied Materials said on the conference call, but will not need U.S. approval from the Department of Justice.Goldman Sachs served as exclusive financial adviser for Applied Materials.(Updates shares in fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Manuel Baigorri in Hong Kong at mbaigorri@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Fion Li at fli59@bloomberg.net, ;Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Giles Turner, Nate LanxonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applied-materials-said-buy-kokusai-055450368.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-07-01	2019-07-01 08:35:02	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Huawei Reprieve Is Good and Bad News for Asia Tech Stocks	(Bloomberg) -- Stock markets in Asia surged in a relief rally Monday after the world’s largest economies declared a truce in their trade war. The sector that just won the biggest reprieve is tech stocks.President Donald Trump’s decision to allow U.S. corporations to resume sales to Huawei Technologies Co., China’s largest telecommunications-equipment maker, and plans to hold off imposing an additional $300 billion in tariffs made tech stocks the best performers in Asia Monday. The MSCI Asia Pacific Infotech Index soared as much as 2%, while the regional benchmark climbed 0.9%.Trump and Xi Call Time (For Now) on Trade War: Balance of PowerShares of chipmakers -- among the biggest contributors to the MSCI Asia Pacific Index -- have been embroiled in the U.S. and China trade conflict for more than a year. Trump’s move to cut off supplies to Huawei in May added to the sector’s wall of worry. Volatility has soared by about 300% since its low just before the trade spat escalated.These Asia Stocks May Benefit From Halt to Huawei Ban, Citi Says“The lifting of a ban on the sale of technology to Chinese companies was a step beyond expectations and the market reaction come Monday will likely be positive,” said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, by email.Samsung Electronics Co. -- the world’s biggest chipmaker -- erased early gains and fell 0.9% after Japan said the exporters of chip materials to South Korea will have to apply for individual approvals from July 4, citing a worsening bilateral trust relationship. SK Hynix Inc., a supplier to both Huawei and U.S. companies, stayed buoyant.On the flipside, Huawei’s limited supply of imported chips that had helped boost China’s domestic producers amid Trump’s blacklist may be negatively impacted. Watch Unigroup Guoxin, Ingenic Semiconductor, Wuhan P&S Information Technology, Hangzhou Silan Microelectronics and Konfoong Material.“The most fragile part of the tech sector in our view remains semiconductor names, due to the uncertainty surrounding Huawei and the entity list combined with persistent price decline in memory chips,” said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale SA.PC, Phone SuppliersTrump’s decision to hold off on an additional levies will be good for suppliers of personal computers and smartphones.“We expect the market to react positively as the next batch of tariffs impacting PCs and smartphones now will not be imposed,” Citigroup analyst Arthur Lai said in a June 30 report. Lai pointed to companies that are “fast and flexible enough to adapt to operating environment changes” like Taiwan’s Delta Electronics, Micro-Star International, Inventec and Wistron.Here are some other sectors to watch:China StocksChina investors can finally turn their focus elsewhere after the Trump-Xi meeting showed some progress on trade. Fund managers weren’t expecting much as the two leaders met Saturday at the Group of 20 summit in Japan. An agreement to resume negotiations will be welcomed by investors.Chinese video surveillance giants could rally -- Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. -- after the U.S. and China agreed to resume negotiations. In May, the U.S. administration considered barring both companies from purchasing U.S. technology.The DMZ MeetTrump’s brief crossing of the North Korean border in the Demilitarized Zone and an agreement to restart stalled nuclear talks in a historic meeting with Kim Jong Un may also move defense-related stocks:South Korea’s so-called ‘‘peace stocks’’: Hyundai Rotem rose 5.9%, Hyundai Elevator climbed 8.5%, Namhae Chemical gained 3.7%, Hyundai Engineering climbed 2.6%, HDC Hyundai Development advanced 0.6%Japan: Ishikawa Seisakusho, Howa Machinery, Hosoya Pyro-Engineering, Mitsubishi Heavy IndustriesJapanWatch auto stocks as Japan and the U.S. agreed to speed up trade talks after Trump threatened to raise auto tariffs on Tokyo. The U.S. is Japan’s largest export market after China and its biggest car customer. Companies to keep an eye on include: Toyota Motor, Honda Motor, Nissan Motor, Isuzu, Hino and Subaru.As disputes over wording on climate change and trade became a focus at the G-20, a Japanese stock that could bear the brunt of any issues on this front is Hitachi Zosen. There are more than 370 waste-to-power plants operating in Japan, according to the environment ministry’s Kurisu. Japanese companies including Hitachi are producing and exporting the facilities.South KoreaPresident Moon Jae-in’s meeting with Trump on Sunday could also give Korea’s stocks a jolt Monday:Auto stocks and their suppliers: Kia Motors, Hyundai Motor, SL Corp., Hyundai Wia, Mando Corp and Hankook TireKorean steel: PoscoSoutheast AsiaVietnam’s recent fame as a big winner of the U.S.-China trade war, putting itself in Trump’s crosshairs, may lead to some moves in the nation’s stock market: Kinh Bac City, Gemadept, Thanh Cong Textile, Vietnam National Textile & Garment Group, FPT Corp., Mobile World.SkepticismWith no real trade deal in place, some aren’t convinced the relief rally expected on Monday will last.“The reprieve may be short-lived and there is still no guarantee that a deal can be reached or even that any deal would completely address all of the differences that have driven investor anxieties, particularly when it comes to technology and the enforcement of a possible deal,” JPMorgan’s Craig said.(Updates throughout with Monday's market moves.)&#92;--With assistance from Naoto Hosoda, Kurt Schussler, Min Jeong Lee, Nguyen Kieu Giang and Cormac Mullen.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Jackie Edwards in Sydney at jedwards160@bloomberg.net;Abhishek Vishnoi in Singapore at avishnoi4@bloomberg.net;Amanda Wang in Shanghai at twang234@bloomberg.net;Heejin Kim in Seoul at hkim579@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Divya Balji at dbalji1@bloomberg.net, Joanna OssingerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-reprieve-good-bad-news-021000357.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-25	2019-06-25 22:00:06	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Global Tech Is Weaker Than It Looks	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Ten months ago, I warned that storm clouds were brewing over the global technology industry. The situation today is much worse.Back then, a U.S.-China trade war was more risk than reality, Apple Inc.’s pending iPhone update held promise, and central banks were still in tightening mode. Yet inventories at the end of June 2018 had climbed to the highest since the financial crisis a decade earlier and a sector-wide slowdown was looming.At the time, the Pollyannas were louder than the Chicken Littles. The next iPhone had yet to launch and Christmas shopping season was coming, argued the optimists.Since then, global technology companies have issued loud warnings about lost sales due to U.S. actions against Huawei Technologies Inc. In short, because the U.S. is restricting what can be sold to the Chinese giant, the company and its suppliers are cutting orders. This is causing a ripple effect from semiconductor materials supplier IQE Plc to chip designer Broadcom Inc.But there’s something you need to know about the Huawei effect: It isn’t the cause of this technology recession. If anything, the company is the reason why the situation didn’t worsen earlier. The U.S. war on Huawei propped up the tech sector, notably semiconductors, over the past year.Let me explain. Immediately after the Trump administration in May blacklisted Huawei from buying U.S. components, Bloomberg News reported that the maker of telecommunications equipment and smartphones had been been stockpiling components in anticipation of some kind of action. Chairman Ren Zhengfei saw his own storm brewing and started saving for the rainy day that came on May 17.This tells us that some proportion of global component demand over the past year wasn’t led by end-product sales, but merely by shelf-stocking. More significantly, what revenue component makers did see was probably a false signal, pointing to demand that didn’t exist.These suspicions were confirmed earlier this month when Mark Liu, chairman of made-to-order chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., told me that he wasn’t sure how much of his company's recent revenue had gone to supplying Huawei’s end-product demand versus building the Chinese company’s inventory. Almost every technology company is a client of TSMC. If Liu, who has the broadest and deepest picture of the global tech sector, can’t make out the difference between demand and inventory build, then you can be sure he’s not alone.There’s also solid data to show the scale of Huawei’s stockpiling. Total inventories climbed 33% last year. Its stash of components – measured as raw materials and works in progress – jumped 76%. At even its most optimistic, there’s no way that Huawei expected 76% revenue growth this year.Which brings us back to the sector as a whole.Here’s an update of the numbers compiled 10 months ago, based on nine leading technology hardware companies and charted by my colleague Elaine He. The results aren’t heartening:With few exceptions, inventories – measured in dollar terms or days outstanding – climbed since June 30, 2018, and were unequivocally higher than two years ago. The revenue slowdowns that have affected every corner of the hardware sector this year make this buildup ominous.Of even greater concern are data pointing to prolonged cash conversion cycles, a measure of how long companies take to turn manufactured goods into money. The only firm to see a solid dip is Apple, and that’s because it tends to generate revenue from customers before having to pay suppliers. Both TSMC and iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (aka Foxconn) have said they hold inventory on their books for their key client. Were it not for that fact, Apple’s rising inventory days outstanding would probably be even higher.A major reason for Hon Hai posting weak earnings in the first quarter was inventory provisions. Those can be reversed if products sitting on shelves get sold to consumers, Hon Hai CFO David Huang told me this month. But shipping an already-made device to meet demand means you don’t need to manufacture a new phone, which in turn means no need to buy components from suppliers, and so forth.That’s the situation we’re in now: plenty of inventory, false signals from the Huawei effect, and a pending global economic slowdown that’s likely to suppress demand. If that doesn’t make make you worry about the state of global technology hardware, then I applaud your optimism. To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Companies that are looking to make newer and better chips need to develop innovative strategies, as the rising use of artificial intelligence changes chip making.  As this industry shifts, a prediction that companies like Intel Corporation (INTC) will boost the capital they spend on equipment has drawn the interest of Wall Street analysts, Barron's reported.

2019-06-19	2019-06-19 23:00:36	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Foxconn Game of Thrones Looms as Its King Abdicates	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- On June 11, for the first time in history, Foxconn Technology Group held an investor relations conference for its flagship company.That’s the good news. The bad news is what the moment portends: The world’s largest electronics manufacturer is about to be left without a CEO.It took founder Terry Gou’s pending departure from Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. to face its stakeholders beyond the legally mandated annual shareholders’ meeting. Gou didn’t even bother to turn up, choosing instead to continue his campaign to become Taiwan’s president.After’s Gou’s departure, which could be as soon as Friday, Foxconn will have a new chairman, and the CEO role will be replaced by a committee of nine. For the past 45 years Gou has been the sole decider and face of the company. So while this major shift in leadership brings sudden and long-overdue transparency, it also leaves his sprawling company – which spans more than a dozen nations, up to one million workers, and an all-star client list – in the hands of a committee and without a chief.I’ve long been skeptical about the company and its future, with or without Gou. As the global tech industry faces both a macroeconomic slowdown and the fallout from U.S.-China trade tensions, Foxconn finds itself caught in the crossfire.The comportment of the company’s new management now allays some of those concerns. At the investor event and a telephone conference that followed, these executives – many of whom had rarely spoken publicly – succinctly fielded questions about the challenges of running Foxconn in the age of President Donald Trump, the possibility of moving iPhone production out of China, and the company’s need to transform. That’s a refreshing change from the waffling, disjointed answers Gou usually gives to the media.Still, this doesn’t mean everything is sorted. The debate over Foxconn’s next chairman, which has been raging for more than a decade, continues. Group CFO Huang Chiu-lian, known as Money Mama, was among the names tipped to take control. Heads of various divisions are also being considered.It’s my belief that Young Liu, currently head of Foxconn’s chip division, will get that job. (Huang isn’t in the running since she won’t be on the new board). Getting the chairmanship, though, doesn’t mean taking Foxconn’s Iron Throne. Rather, this management-by-committee strategy sets the company up for possible infighting among various division chiefs, some of whom are part of that inner circle.Any executive decision inevitably becomes a question of resource allocation. Since Foxconn is notoriously tight-fisted, divisions will likely need to compete with each other or engage in back-room horse trading to get what they want.If the collegiality on display at the new team’s first public outing dissolves, then the executive lineup is likely to become a war of attrition. When Gou floated the idea of retirement a dozen years ago, he talked about winnowing his list down from more than 35 to less than 10 possible successors. But he’s never groomed anyone, unlike compatriot Morris Chang, who spent considerable time training up his successors for the company he founded and chaired, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. More than a few people who follow Foxconn have told me they think that most lieutenants will retire pretty quickly if they don’t get clear control over the company once Gou steps down. As some depart, competition to take the reins may ensue. My fear is that a series of departures and jostling will weaken Foxconn just when it needs stability and a single leader. Once that shakes out, any eventual winner may find that there’s no throne to take, let alone dragons to fight with.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2019-05-29	2019-05-29 17:39:50	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	The China Trade War Is Unhealthy	Trade wars are unhealthy for economies and other living things. While trade between the U.S. and China is a tiny part of global trade, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) says the trade war is putting a &quot;cap&quot; on the global economy. CEO Jamie Dimon says escalating trade tensions could end the recovery. Half the globe's growth comes from trade.Source: Maher Najm via FlickrIf nothing else, the trade war forces people to choose sides.TV analyst Jim Cramer has become a &quot;trade hawk,&quot; a stance that lets the administration call those who favor growth &quot;trade doves.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlibaba Group Holding (NASDAQ:BABA) executive chairman Jack Ma is talking up a listing in Hong Kong, to make his company more independent of U.S. investment.In an era of stupid policies, this is the biggest stupid of all. Trade ReciprocityThe trade war is partly based on a lie. The lie is that the trade deficit is money &quot;lost&quot; to a trading partner.  In fact, it's a cost of goods sold, recouped in the form of lower prices, not just for toys and diapers but for finished goods the U.S. can export.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June The trade war is thus largely based on fear.The fear is that China is taking the future, that China will dominate the world unless our trade deficit with it is reduced. Ultimately the argument is that trade is war by other means.China's &quot;belt and road&quot; initiative, an enormous infrastructure project of road and port improvements around the world, funded by Chinese loans, is called a &quot;debt trap,&quot; a way for China to gain control of remote economies.Mainly, the U.S. relationship with China is seen as a win-lose proposition. If they rise, we fall, and vice versa.This is the biggest lie of all. What the U.S. WantsThe stated goal of U.S. policymakers is equal treatment for U.S. technology. American internet companies are kept out of China and every niche has a Chinese imitator, because China wants absolute control over what its people say and see. One in five U.S. companies claim China has stolen its intellectual property. Chinese products are accused of being used to spy, which is why the U.S. is cracking down on Huawei.Unfortunately, that war has already been lost. China is integral to the global supply chain, especially the U.S. supply chain. Every major U.S. tech manufacturer has close ties to China. That's because even educated Chinese labor is cheap and abundant.Every escalation in war rhetoric hits companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hard. Since things heated up in April, Apple is down 12%. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is down nearly 30% from its April highs, a loss of around $20 billion. The Bottom LineThis administration doesn't care who it hurts in the pursuit of power, except Wall Street.If the trade war starts costing Wall Street big money, and moneymen stop listening to trade hawks in the name of profit, Trump will turn around as he did early this year, after the fall's tech wreck.It's all a game, a way of saying that America is still King of the World. Make America seem great again.But America isn't King of the World, nor should it be. A win-win deal can be made, and we should make it. We will, once the market tells this administration that it must, or we may see business go Democratic in 2020.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

In a keynote demo, AMD showed the Ryzen 7 3700X, an 8-core, third-gen CPU that will sell for $329, handily outperforming Intel's Core i9-9900K -- it launched last fall, sells for $488 and relies on a 14nm Intel manufacturing process node that's getting long in the tooth -- when running the popular Cinebench R20 content-rendering benchmark.  It also showed the Ryzen 7 3800X, a more powerful sibling that will sell for $399, holding even with the 9900K when playing battle royale game PUBG (gaming has been a strong point for high-end Intel CPUs).	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b460858a-d348-33ea-8e03-bf707d4f03f1/amd-and-intel-unveil-their.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-24	2019-05-24 13:52:32	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Stock Could Still Have a Long Way to Fall	Editor's Note: This story was corrected on May 26. 2019.General Electric (NYSE:GE). JC Penney (NYSE:JCP). US Steel (NYSE:X). In investing, and business, a good name and a long history are worth precisely nothing. This is especially true in technology, where once-great names like Silicon Graphics, Wang and Novell never got a chance to grow old.Source: Shutterstock But Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)? Intel, the home of Moore's Law, whose semiconductor chips practically invented the world we live in? Intel?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYes, Intel.In the last month, Intel has lost over 23% of its value. That's over $45 billion whacked off its market cap. At about $43.60, it's selling for just 10 times last year's earnings, just three times last year's sales. Is it possible that Intel could join these other names on the scrap heap of business history? Self-Induced Troubles for Intel StockIt is possible.Intel has been drifting for years. I worked on a project during the last decade about their problems with mobile chip technology. They're still not fixed. CEO Bob Swan is just the seventh leader in Intel's history, the second without a technology background. Today only two members of the company's nine-member board are technologists.  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer As Adam Savage once said, &quot;Well, there's your problem.&quot; Intel has lost its technology edge.Intel stock is four years late with its 10 nm manufacturing process. Rival Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is already rolling out 7 nm chips.Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), once Intel's baby brother, has lapped it in this decade. Since the start of 2016, AMD's stock is up over 800%. Intel is up 29% in that period.  The average Nasdaq gain has been 53%.Intel stock has been beaten in modem chips by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), beaten in memory chips by Micron Technologies (NASDAQ:MU) and beaten in graphics by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).AMD is now beating it in microprocessors.Intel's chips have been hit repeatedly with security flaws, and the fixes cost processing speed. AMD seems immune to the latest vulnerabilities.Intel's low prices and high volumes mean it has reclaimed its lead among semiconductor makers from Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). But that's a function of the memory chip business, which will turn around with the rest of the market.Intel is down to $3 billion in cash, down from $15 billion at the end of 2015. Long-term debt is over $25 billion, above the level listed on the balance sheet for common stock equity. Swan's WayBob Swan didn't start this fire.Former CEO Brian Krzanich tossed out rivals like a Game of Thrones character but was undone by his own sex life. Krzanich left the executive cupboard bare. Intel was unable to recruit any of the names he dumped for its top slot, settling on Swan the way Manchester United did on Ole Gunnar-Solskjaer.Swan seemed to be doing OK as interim boss for Intel stock, bringing in an outside perspective his predecessors did not have, but since January the problems have piled up for the former eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) executive, who started his career at General Electric. Swan has struck an attitude of humility but he's still losing top tech people, especially top women, like cloud boss Raejeanne Skillern, now at Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX). The Bottom LineI must join those analysts who now wonder if Bob Swan has the technical chops to turn Intel around. Swan's chief technology officer, Mike Mayberry, is an Intel lifer from the production side of the house. He's not a visionary.Intel needs a visionary. Technology companies are natural kingdoms. They can't be led by committees. They require strong leadership of the kind Intel rivals have. But Andy Grove isn't walking through that door. Gordon Moore is still around, but he's 90.Intel stock is continuing to drift toward the rocks. Investors have finally gotten the scent. While I hope I'm wrong, the company's worst days may be ahead of it.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-05-15	2019-05-15 11:24:08	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Wait Out the Storm in Nvidia Stock	During the boom market of 2017-2018, TV analyst Jim Cramer took to calling one of his dogs Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), after the graphics chip company whose stock just wouldn't stop rising. Shares that sold for under $50 three years ago went for as much as $281 last October.Source: Shutterstock The shares will probably open around $162 today. Blame President Donald Trump's latest tariffs on Chinese goods, imposed with almost no warning and with an absurd claim that China is paying them to America, when in fact they're a tax American buyers pay.Absent the trade war, Nvidia's business was bottoming out. It is due to report earnings May 16, with net income of 79 cents per share on revenue of $2.2 billion expected, but now, that doesn't matter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What Is Lost for NVDA StockNvidia's designs make it the leader in gaming graphics. Chinese manufacturing makes the designs affordable, enabling the cloud-based artificial intelligence boom.Chinese manufacturing expertise is essential to the process. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) just can't deliver the precision of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Tariffs don't change that. China has a symbiotic relationship with U.S. technology, not a parasitic one.  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market Nvidia shares bottomed out from their last plunge, caused by an inventory recession, in December, at around $130. But they will head back there soon as the technical indicators on the stock have all broken down. Whether the losses come slowly or in a panicked rush is the only question.And the whole thing is entirely unnecessary, because the business is still doing well. Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), which will soon be a unit of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), continues working with Nvidia on machine learning in the cloud.Once it finishes swallowing Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) for $6.9 billion, Nvidia will be able to deliver fast networking fabric to complement its chips, making it a more complete cloud hardware play.Nvidia has a new software development kit, called Isaac, now available to make development of robots easier. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), which was thought to be replacing Nvidia hardware with its own, is instead adding more support for it within its cloud.  Nvidia's new tablet, dubbed Shield, has the power of a desktop computer.Business is great. People are terrific. Life is wonderful.Then along comes Trump. Don't Buy Nvidia NowWhen a tech stock is about to go down, analysts suddenly find excuses for it, and they're finding excuses for Nvidia.Besides the technical indicators, analysts are worried about the latest Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) supercomputer, worried that its graphics cards are catching up, and noting that AMD has won the processor contract for Sony's (NYSE:SNE) Playstation 5.Nvidia is in a shouting match with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) over self-driving car tech, there are problems with some of its software drivers, and some Mellanox shareholders are suing, claiming the price Nvidia is paying for their stock is too low. While NVDA stock looks OK long-term, there's just a lot of noise to deal with right now. The Bottom LineNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang illustrates why trying to split China from the U.S. is nonsense. He was born in Taiwan, in 1963, but his family emigrated to Kentucky. He has endowed an engineering center at Stanford, with his name on it. He sports leather jackets and is the embodiment of the American dream.But argument has no place against arbitrary power. The best thing for investors to do is wait out the storm and buy when Trump finds another shiny object to hate and decides he needs the tech economy.As I've said many times, trade wars are unhealthy for economies and other living things.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-04-25	2019-04-25 11:40:06	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Better Pricing, New Product Release Could Boost Micron Stock	Micron (NASDAQ:MU) will not announce earnings until June. However, with peers SK Hynix and Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) releasing quarterly reports soon, the focus will return to the chip sector. Moreover, Micron has just released its next generation of chips for cloud and enterprise systems. Such factors could result in the turnaround needed to boost MU stock. However, investors need to pay attention to the actual pricing commanded by memory chips before turning bullish.  Source: Shutterstock   Despite the fact that MU will not report earnings for two more months, the company remains in the news. The company unveiled the third generation of high-performance NVMe SSDs. These chips will go into both cloud and enterprise applications. ` The company claims the new Micron 9300 SSDs will offer the industry's lowest latency. They bring a read and write capability at 3.5 GB per second. They will also achieve this speed using 28% less power than chips of the previous generation.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond Micron chips power data centers, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality, and autonomous cars among other things. Such technologies require large amounts of memory. More important, their use in self-driving vehicles makes minimizing latency a matter of life and death.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Chip Pricing and Micron StockThis need should ensure robust demand for its new chips. Nonetheless, the critical question for MU investors will hinge on chip pricing. Despite the increased importance of memory chips, MU stock has not escaped its dependence on memory prices to move the equity higher. Since the beginning, Micron stock has risen during times of high memory prices and fallen when memory prices crashed.MU stock investors have become accustomed to this. Despite a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of only 3.9, MU struggled over the last year. To be sure, memory prices have fallen, taking the forward PE to about 9.1. While the adage of &quot;it's different this time&quot; did not pan out, one thing has indeed changed.In previous price cycles, MU stock would fall into losses. However, memory demand has grown exponentially since the PC era. For this reason, Micron remained profitable when memory prices fell. Also, MU did not fall into single digits as it did in previous memory price downturns. In the recent memory price crash, Micron stock bottomed at $28.39 per share.The rock-bottom PE ratio may have helped take MU stock back to the $43 per share range. Nonetheless, the company reported a 28% drop in DRAM memory sales and just a 2% increase in sales for NAND memory. Consequently, profit estimates have continued falling.However, if SK Hynix and Samsung show price improvements, it could mean profit estimates stop falling. As my colleague Bret Kenwell reported, firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) expect higher second-half sales. Moreover, if this new generation of memory chips lead to higher pricing, it could mean the Micron stock price resumes its climb. Final thoughts on Micron StockThe release of next-generation chips could help to boost MU stock, but investors still need to focus on memory pricing. Thanks to the advent of data centers, VR, self-driving cars, and other applications, memory chips have become more essential than ever.While this does not change the cyclical nature of MU, it will probably lead to improved revenues. Moreover, with its South Korea-based peers about to release earnings, traders can see revenue results and company forecasts on memory prices.Nonetheless, the success of Micron still depends on memory pricing. Other chip companies believe pricing will improve soon. If that comes to pass, I think higher chip prices combined with Micron's low PE ratio could boost MU stock. Still, until chip prices show improvement, I would expect little upside in Micron.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

TSMC, the world's biggest contract chipmaker, said a recent settlement between its top clients Apple and Qualcomm to end their two-year legal dispute over smartphone chips will help the Taiwanese firm.  ""While the economic factor and mobile product seasonality are still lingering as we move into second quarter, we believe we may have passed the bottom of the cycle of our business as we are seeing demand stabilizing,"" TSMC CFO Lora Ho said."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-upbeat-chip-outlook-apple-100954359.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-04-04	2019-04-04 15:38:37	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	A Pair of Semiconductor Stock Buys: AMD and Micron	Are you a bull or a bear? Following the first quarter's massive market rally, the question might rightfully beg asking. But when it comes to semiconductor stocks Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), the big picture suggests a paired up buy strategy looks about right. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock It was a standout day for semiconductor stocks across the board Wednesday. The Vaneck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) rallied 2.33%, saw its best close in more than a year and third strongest finish in its history.Reports that a U.S.-China trade deal is at hand, strong chip demand news out of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and broker Nomura Instinet issuing a pair of sector buys made for a winning trifecta for the sector. And nowhere was that more evident than in AMD stock and MU shares.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor its part, Advanced Micro Devices enjoyed a hefty gain of 8.5%. The outsized performance was helped in part by Nomura Instinet's buy recommendation and $33 price target. Meanwhile, Micron's second place finish among large cap semis and 3.44% advance was nothing to sneeze at either.  * The Elite 8 Stocks to Buy for Massive Outperformance But before you get concerned that Wednesday was a last hurrah of sorts following an exhaustive rally to kick off 2019 and not to mention the market's historic decade long bull run, think again. Or better yet, look again at the weekly charts of AMD stock and Micron. Semiconductor Stock Bu: AMD Stock While at times over the past decade AMD stock has enjoyed the rising market tide, shares are a far cry removed from their all-time highs of $48.50 set way back in 2000. For some investors and given how well Advanced Micro Devices has been performing under CEO Lisa Su, these two factors could be the basis for looking more closely at buying AMD.But there's more to Advance Micro Devices shares too.The big picture offered on AMD's weekly chart points to a stock firing on all cylinders technically. Though that's not to say there isn't challenging price volatility at times. There is.More importantly, with Advanced Micro Devices having reaffirmed its uptrend into the upper third of a very well-constructed corrective base; there's little reason to doubt new relative highs are in the offing and Nomura will be playing a game of catch-up with its price target.My suggestion is buy AMD today and do yourself a favor by using an initial price target of $35 for profit-taking as shares hit marginal fresh highs.In the event our enthusiasm in Advanced Micro Devices proves misplaced, using a stop-loss below $26.50 offers practical risk management, as exposure is contained to less than 9% in this volatile stock. This exit strategy in AMD stock also allows for the tendency of gaps to get filled without being a casualty of less-severe poking and prodding from bears. Semiconductor Stock Buy: MU StockThe other half of our semiconductor stock pairs trade is memory chip specialist Micron. And to hedge the long Advanced Micro position, MU stock also demands to  be purchased.Similar to AMD, Micron shares have seen some rip-roaring rallies. Here too, though, MU stock has been largely shut out of the day-to-day bull of the past 10 years which has left an unforgettable mark on the broader market.The good news, as the detailed weekly chart points at, is that despite its relative weakness, MU stock has done a fair bit of constructive testing. And with a fresh uptrend just emerging and MU having cleared the 200-day simple moving average, there's plenty of room in our estimation for a period of bullish out-performance in Micron shares.Of course there are risks. This is investing, after all. Two glaring potential obstacles for MU stock are the 50% and 62% retracement levels. But that shouldn't stop investors from buying shares today.Bottom or squiggly price line, with a volatile name like Micron which has a history of explosive and more linear-like moves once a trend is established, it's easy to be optimistic without being overly-hopeful resistance will be overcome.In case we're wrong and to keep the odds of success in our favor, I'd recommend using the 62% Fibonacci level near $51 as the first target for profit-taking before setting your sights on 2018's high of $64.66. And if we're really off in our forecast, exiting slightly beneath last week's hammer-like doji of $39.01 is equally smart business on a couple levels.

2019-04-04	2019-04-04 13:48:00	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Micron Stock Is Heating up for the Long-Term Growth	Is Micron (NASDAQ:MU) stock finally a must-own name? This name has become a battleground, with bulls insisting that MU stock is too cheap to ignore. Bears counter with the fact that DRAM demand has slowed and that Micron will head lower as a result.Source: Shutterstock The bears have been right so far, as Micron has fallen precipitously from its highs last summer. However, we're starting to see a turn take place and that bodes well for the memory maker.Is now the time to get in? Let's examine.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Micron Is a Second Half StoryAt the Goldman Sachs Technology conference on Feb. 12 CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that Micron should see a stronger second half in 2019. He noted that DRAM demand remains healthy and that the company is working through its higher inventory levels.  * 7 Biometric Stocks to Watch as AI Rises We knew these inventory levels would be bloated, as management for companies like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) said they intentionally pulled forward future orders as tight DRAM markets continued to push pricing higher. It was a smart move by Cisco, while Micron and others manufacturers are now paying the price.Anyway, last month Mehrotra again reiterated that outlook when Micron reported its fiscal second-quarter results. While the company beat on lowered earnings and revenue expectations, Q3 guidance came up short for both metrics. In short, Micron is still struggling to work through its inventory, but that doesn't mean a H2 2019 recovery is off the table.Now we're seeing it in other places, as semiconductor stocks are getting a boost with expectations for a stronger second half too. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NASDAQ:TSM) is seeing strong order growth for its 7nm chip, while sources are saying Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will see a &quot;significant&quot; boost in second-half sales.This bodes well for Micron too. Valuing Micron StockOne of the main catalysts for Micron stock has always been the valuation. How does a stock with such profitability trade with such a low valuation? Well, Micron hasn't always been this profitable, but it has always been prone to booms and busts.When we're in the boom phase, life is great for the bulls, as Micron is printing money and its bottom line continues to swell. During the bust phase though, revenue is under pressure, inventories are bloated and margins take a beating.Because of the volatility in the business cycle, MU stock garners a lower valuation than the rest of the market and many of its peers in tech. Case in point, analysts expect the company to earn more than $7 per share this year. With the stock price near $44, that values Micron stock at just over 6 times earnings. What a paltry multiple!However, consider that revenue is forecast to fall almost 20% year-over-year in 2019 and another 1.5% next year and it starts to make sense. Further, earnings are expected to fall 40% this year and another 18% in 2019. Who's going to pay a premium for that?That's always been the issue with Micron stock. Even though the company churns out strong free cash flow and is healthily profitable, it's prone to these wild swings. Investors with a strong gut and a long-term outlook can justify a long position in this name when the right price presents itself. Trading MU Stock  Click to EnlargeMicron stock is moving nicely, now over the 200-day moving average and knocking on that $44 to $45 resistance zone once again. The stock has met this level twice in as many months and has put in a higher low each time after its test. That bodes well for bulls, as the more times a level is tested, the more likely it is to give way.It helps that MU is trending higher and with the latest move, is trading above all three major moving averages. That said, should MU stock pullback, it still looks healthy so long as it holds uptrend support (blue line) and the 50-day moving average.If investors really start to gobble up Micron on the belief that the second half will mark a turnaround in its business, we need to see it close above $45. If it can, that opens up the door to a few upside targets.The first isn't very high, at just $46.61 where the 50% Fibonacci retracement stands. However, a rally up to $50 would be attractive, with some follow-through potential to ~$51 to possibly $52, the former of which is the 61.8% retracement.On the downside, MU stock will need to reset should uptrend support and the 50-day not buoy the stock price.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-02-01	2019-02-01 10:01:19	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Intel Stock Awaits Likely Rebound Under Interim-Turned-Permanent CEO Swan	"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) looked around the world for its next CEO and settled for the quiet man in its own backyard. The company known as &quot;Chipzilla&quot; earned $5.2 billion, $1.12 per share, on revenue of $18.7 billion during the fourth quarter, all without a real CEO. Meanwhile, INTC stock lost 10.3% of its value -- versus a 5.34% decline in the Nasdaq Composite index -- since the June resignation of CEO Brian Krzanich.

That Q4 performance was under the interim leadership of Bob Swan, 58, who was tapped yesterday as the permanent replacement for Krzanich, who exited over an affair with a colleague.

After months of speculation around names like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su and former Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cloud chief Diane Bryant, Intel has settled on the boring insider. The reaction of traders was a giant &quot;meh,&quot; as the shares fell 2.4%

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Under Swan, Intel has glided carefully forward, a big ship on a calm sea, slowly becoming a great bargain. The shares traded on yesterday at just over 10 times earnings, with a dividend that yields more than 2.7%, and buying interest among analysts was drying up. 

If you believe in buying when they scream sell and selling when they scream buy, it's time to buy.

### Intel's Problems

Intel is two companies, a foundry and a design shop. Neither is a top performer.

The foundry makes chips. The foundry needs attention, because its technology has fallen behind rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF).

  * 7 Stocks With Too Much Riding On China 



Intel also designs chips for most major chip niches. It's behind AMD in microprocessors, behind Micron Electronics (NASDAQ:MU) in memory, behind Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in graphics, and behind Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in communications. It's a huge &quot;addressable market&quot; as Swan notes. Intel doesn't have to win the market to win sales.

Wherever analysts look they see Intel as second-rate. Yet Intel keeps moving forward, growing at 9% per year. Swan's biggest decision so far has been to invest more in Israel, with $11 billion committed to manufacturing there and a $6 billion bid for Mellanox Technologies (NASDAQ:MLNX), which makes chips for data centers.

Cloud data centers are why Intel has been able to get away with mediocrity. Clouds don't need the latest chips, they need chips that are good enough and as cheap as possible. It's an area where Intel's mass production still offers leadership, and it's an area that's still growing. 

### Which Way Swan?

Swan is the first outsider to become Intel CEO, and the first to rise from the finance side. He didn't go to Harvard or Stanford, but to the State University of New York.

Swan has executive experience at General Electric (NYSE:GE), at Northrup Grumman (NYSE:NOC), at eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), and he even led Webvan as that grocery delivery service went under after the dot-com bubble popped. He kept falling up because of his reputation as a great numbers man, and a consensus builder.

Swan now faces the hard decisions about what to do concerning Intel's internal contradictions and market problems. He is unlikely to breakup the company, as I have suggested off-and-on for six years. He is most likely to seek consensus from his managers, and to follow whatever low-risk growth path his numbers see as indicated.

  * 7 High-Dividend Stocks Yielding More Than 5% (Plus a Bonus) 



Even without a grand strategy, Intel stock is super-cheap right now. The company is highly profitable, it's doing $71 billion of business each year with an operating margin over 30%, and the market cap is under three times sales at $216 billion.

### Bottom Line on INTC Stock

Right now, Intel stock buyers can get a dividend equivalent to a 10-year government bond. The company is cheap and financially strong. There's a floor called results keeping INTC stock out of the pre-2018 trading range of the mid-30s.

Minimal risk, maximum chance of profit. That's how I speculate.

(CRUS), Skyworks Solutions Inc. (SWKS), and Qorvo Inc. (QRVO).  All three of these chip makers rely heavily on Apple for revenue, in particular from the iPhone, which is expected to see demand decelerate again in Apple’s current quarter.  While these same stocks once benefited from past Apple “super cycles” in which new generations of products would create a tail of wealth for suppliers, the breakdown of that cycle, and forecasts for falling or weaker iPhone sales, is now having the opposite effect.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/81d1652d-c90d-3bdb-aa6f-cf2a5d91b67b/apple-suppliers-face-more.html?.tsrc=rss

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



Investors have plenty of choices, but I think these are the seven best semiconductor stocks to buy now.

### Semiconductor Stocks to Buy: NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)

NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) shares trade at steeply discounted price-to-earnings multiples relative to the growth ahead. At a tailing P/E of 10.7 times and a roughly 20% EPS growth rate of next year, the PEG is 0.8X.

NXP stock is down around 37% since China failed to approve Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) overture to buy it. But the company has a multiyear plan in place for supplying chips to the automotive market which is already reaping benefits.

Fortunately, management led the company's foray in the fast-growing auto market while waiting for the QCOM-NXPI approval. Its investments over the years will result in strong end-market positioning, especially for electric vehicles and self-driving vehicles.

In the third quarter, NXP reported strong numbers in automotive. The unit brought in $990 million in revenue, up 4% from last year, offset by slower growth in Secured Connected Devices and Secure Identification Solutions.

Investors do not appreciate NXP's transformation. They are still acting as if the company relies on smartphone demand for growth. But automotive is growing at a faster pace. And if you set a 15X or 20X P/E on NXPI stock and the stock is already worth at least $90 a share. That implies upside of at least 14%.

Last month, NXPI priced $2 billion worth of unsecured notes, half of which it will use to pay down debt. A share buyback would further lower share count and help EPS.

Per Tipranks, 14 analysts have, on average, a $98.31 price target on NXP Semiconductors.

### Qualcomm (QCOM)

Markets are so bearish on Qualcomm that a short report from Kerrisdale Capital sent the stock lower by almost 5% on Jan. 23 alone. The activist fund is bearish on the smartphone chip giant because it doubts the firm will come out ahead in its trial against the Federal Trade Commission.

With QCOM stock 33% below its yearly high, the company needs a strong quarterly earnings report, scheduled for Jan. 30 after market close, to reverse the stock's fall. It also needs to beat Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the courtroom. Markets value the company as if it is monopolizing its IP and royalty rates, yet Apple depended on Qualcomm's 4G technology a few years ago. The firm has a high-performing Snapdragon processor that Android suppliers want to use for powering devices.

QCOM claims it is owed at least $7 billion from Apple, but even after reaching a settlement, Apple will still be behind in 5G.

Without Apple, Qualcomm still has an exceptionally strong business. The wireless modem industry has plenty of competition from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and MediaTek. When it comes to preference, Qualcomm has the best wireless solutions, so devices makers who want superior technology will need to work out a deal with them.

17 analysts covering QCOM stock have an average $67 price target. A 10-year DCF Revenue Exit model, which assumes single-digit revenue growth and one weak year, suggests a fair value of at least $70 a share.

### Micron (MU)

The climb in Micron (NASDAQ:MU) from the single-digit share price in 2016 to over $60 in 2018, came to an end ahead of the escalation of the U.S.-China trade war. In its first-quarter earnings report posted on Dec. 18, 2018, Micron posted sharply lower revenue guidance -- it expects Q2 revenue to be in the range of $5.7 billion-$6.3 billion. Analysts at the time had forecast revenue of $7.2 billion. Weaker demand for both NAND and DRAM is the primary reason for the disappointing outlook.

Investors now know that an absurdly low P/E is not a good enough reason to expect shares to resume an uptrend. At a $37 stock price, MU stock is valued at a trailing P/E of just 3X. Its forward P/E is just above 5X. Why should anyone bet on a chip cycle returning to high growth again?

The trade war between two giant nations created a temporary but noticeable dip in demand. The market now has excess supply, pressuring prices. However, fundamentals continue to improve. Micron bought out Intel's holdings in the 3D XPoint joint venture. And the growth in AI applications will not slow down, which creates heavy demand for very-high-density memory.

Developing 3D XPoint takes lots of time but demand will pick up when it is ready and the product works with operating systems and software. Fortunately for value investors, markets are impatient and only value Micron on NAND and DRAM dynamics.

With tax-loss selling in December now out of the way, patient investors may accumulate Micron and hold it for a few years.

### Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)

In the Semiconductor-Integrated Circuits space, Taiwan Semiconductor's (NYSE:TSM) strong fourth-quarter results are positive developments for the sector. The firm reported an EPS of 63 cents a share on revenue of $9.4 billion. More importantly, gross margin and net revenue met guidance. Revenue, gross margin (of 47.7%) and net income all rose from last year.

Communications made up 64% of revenue for the quarter. Computer brought in 11% of the total but as the 7nm manufacturer for AMD, expect the PC market to add nicely to sales in 2019.

TSMC forecast revenue of between $7.3 billion and $7.4 billion. Gross profit margin will be in the range of 43%-45%. The sequential dip is not a concern because the smartphone industry needs to work off the inventory in high-end units. Demand for smartphones is seasonally weak at this time. By the second half of this year, new devices will renew demand for TSMC's components.

TSMC could benefit if high-end smartphone manufacturers recognize that the high-demand elasticity favors lowering prices. Consumers are not willing to pay for expensive devices only to get useless features they will never use. Needless to say, TSMC and other smartphone chip suppliers would benefit from higher unit sales driven by lower average sales prices.

### ASML Holding (ASML)

With a market cap of around $73 billion, ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is a little larger than Qualcomm and more than twice as big as NXPI. The firm reported first-quarter results on Jan. 23.

ASML earned EUR 1.87 (USD $2.13) as revenue grew 22.7% to EUR 3.14 billion ($3.57 billion). The firm forecast Q1 sales falling slightly from last year. It attributed the light forecast on customers delaying orders. Similar to what other chip firms are saying, ASML said that sales will pick up in the second half of this year.

The CEO said:

&quot;We have customer demand for 30 EUV systems in 2019 and these shipments will include the first volume production systems to DRAM memory customers. We expect that chips produced on our EUV scanners will start to become available to consumers and enterprises in 2019.&quot;

ASML's near-term weakness is temporary. Slow demand in its end markets is due to delayed deliveries for its litho systems. For the full year 2019, the Logic segment will drive ASML's growth. Customers are demanding advanced nodes, driving demand for its immersion systems and EUV.

The CEO's positive outlook for DRAM, plus expectations for strong demand from China despite the U.S.-imposed trade restrictions, are good reasons investors should consider buying ASML stock.

ASML will declare a dividend of EUR 2.10 a share ($2.39 USD), up from EUR 1.40 (USD $1.59) last year. The 1.5% dividend yield is small but would suit income investors looking for exposure to semi technology stocks.

### Applied Materials (AMAT)

Considered a &quot;jack of all trades&quot; in the semiconductor space, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a diverse business in multiple sectors.  For this reason, the company delivered double-digit growth in 2018 despite a challenging second half. Near-term headwinds will continue, but the fluctuations this time around are smaller and less volatile.

Applied Materials attributes its diverse business customer sources -- customer, enterprise, industrial -- for the lower volatility in its results.

AMAT will produce the first EUV tools this year. Sales will start to add meaningfully to results, so investors may expect good revenue momentum. But even though revenue may fall in absolute terms, the company is setting the foundation for innovative materials to maintain its competitive edge.

Applied forecast a second-half recovery. Management is probably anticipating trade relations improving. More significant would be the U.S. and China agreeing on a trade deal that sees lower tariffs and fewer barriers to trade. Suppliers collectively cut orders or bought goods months in advance of the tariff war. And that is contributing to the near-term weakness.

AMAT ended the year 2018 with $5.6 billion in cash and investments. It returned $946 million to shareholders and bought back $751 million in shares. It still has a massive $4.3 billion remaining in its buyback authorization.

If shares fall again, maybe even to the sub-$30 levels, management could take advantage of the weak share price by buying back shares.

### Lam Research Corporation (LRCX)

In the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials sub-sector, Lam Research Corporation's strong second-quarter report is a bright spot for the chip sector. The firm posted Q2 earnings of $3.87 per share that beat consensus. This is sharply higher than the $3.36 a share posted last quarter. Revenue of $2.5 billion fell just 2% from last year but is up $200 million from the previous quarter. Lam Research forecast Q3 revenue of $2.25 billion-$2.55 billion. EPS will come in at $3.20 to $3.60.

Similar to Applied Materials, Lam Research is increasing shareholder value by buying back shares. The board authorized a $5 billion repurchase program. This is funded through existing cash on hand, cash flow, and from lending.

Etch and Deposition are both central to the customer technology roadmaps. Etch, or high aspect ratio etch, in memory chips are needed for critical applications. Deposition brought film quality, repeatability, and productivity. It gained momentum in DRAM and NAND thanks to ALD application wins. Lam Research very clearly has a strong pipeline.

By offering difficult technology that is not easy to achieve productivity-wise, the firm has a strong moat. Operationally, this allows Lam Research to respond to near-term macro challenges by raising its efficiency. And it is focusing on operational efficiency without sacrificing research and development efforts.­

Eight analysts on Wall Street are very bullish on Lam Research's prospects, with an average price target of about $190 a share. On Jan. 24, four of those analysts reiterated either a &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;hold&quot; rating on the stock.

As of this writing, Chris Lau held shares of NXP Semiconductors.

2019-01-23	2019-01-23 16:24:05	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Don’t Jump on Nvidia Stock Just Yet, It Might Stay Stuck Awhile	"It seems, for now, like the collapse in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has ended. Nvidia stock has bounced about 20% from late December lows. Of course, NVDA stock still sits more than 40% below October highs.

Indeed, NVDA was one of the biggest victims of the market-wide sell-off that began in early October, and it's been one of the bigger beneficiaries of the &quot;buy the dip&quot; response to late December lows. But the decline in Nvidia stock wasn't caused just by broad market fears which means the bounce is going to take more than investors looking for bargains.

And at least in the near term, I'm skeptical there's a catalyst for further upside here. NVDA fell sharply after Q3 earnings in November, largely due to weak guidance for the fourth quarter.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 7 Stupidly Cheap Stocks to Buy Now 



With those Q4 earnings on the way next month, Nvidia is likely to show little, if any growth. Pricing pressure caused by a cryptocurrency mining glut isn't going away any time soon. And news from chip rivals suggests pricing across the semiconductor space is getting worse, not better.

Longer-term, the case for NVDA stock still looks intriguing, given multiple potential drivers. But the 17% rise in NVDA in the first three weeks of 2019 might be as much as investors can expect.

### The Pricing Problem

The key question facing NVDA at the highs was whether it was an exception to the semiconductor rule. As chip stocks soared in recent years, investors seemed to forget that the semiconductor business historically has been a tough one. This wasn't just true of Nvidia, but also of rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and memory play Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU).

Pricing generally falls; performance has to steadily improve. Demand and supply imbalances often lead to cyclical booms and busts. A chip shortage leads prices to soar, production increases to meet the demand, and even as suppliers insist that this time they won't overproduce, a glut eventually emerges and prices and earnings plunge.

Chip bulls last year began to argue that the cyclical days were over, as secular demand drivers like IoT (Internet of Things) and cloud computing would lead to years of rising sales. Semiconductor stocks like NVDA now could be - and were - valued like other tech plays.

That thesis has been blown up, with Nvidia's Q4 a key reason why. And recent news suggests that pricing and supply will be a problem for some time. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) slashed guidance coming out of its Q4 report last week.

Even NVDA bulls have lowered 2019 projections. And Nvidia CFO Colette Kress seemed to give relatively muted commentary toward pricing, China, and datacenter at a recent conference.

It looks like it's going to get worse (or at best stay bad) before it gets better for Nvidia. And so it seems unlikely that Q4 results next month will do much for Nvidia stock.

### The Long-Term Case for Nvidia Stock

Long-term, admittedly, there's still a case for NVDA. The major growth drivers here, datacenter, automotive, even gaming, still exist. The valuation assigned NVDA looks much more reasonable, at about 20x earnings backing out the company's net cash. Analysts remain behind the stock, with an average price target of $228 suggesting over 50% upside.

I'm simply not sure I see a catalyst ahead. Q4 numbers are likely to be disappointing. There's pricing pressure across the industry. And I do wonder whether NVDA is the best &quot;buy the dip&quot; play in the depressed chip space.

Equipment manufacturer Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) looks attractive, as I wrote last month. Micron stock seems to have bottomed after earnings.

More broadly, Nvidia stock clearly is a &quot;show me&quot; story. Even 20x earnings, which sounds cheap in the context of tech, is a relatively high multiple for a chip stock.

It's a multiple that still incorporates long-term growth in the context of the still-real semiconductor cycle. It's going to take at least two quarters for Nvidia to show that growth and reignite investor confidence.

Some investors may see that as reason enough to buy here, and simply wait for growth to come around. Personally, I think the opportunity in NVDA will still be there for the first half of 2019 at least, and potentially at a lower price.

As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-01-08	2019-01-08 12:32:02	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	Should Semiconductor Investors Worry about Apple’s Weak Guidance?	"Semiconductor Stocks Plunge on Apple's Weak Revenue Guidance

(Continued from Prior Part)

## What’s behind Apple’s downtrend?

Previously, we saw that Apple (AAPL) has been hit by slowing iPhone demand, which sent the company’s stock on a downward path. The stock has fallen 36% to a new 52-week low of $142 between November 1, 2018, and January 3, 2019. The downtrend started on November 1 when the company reported lower-than-expected revenue guidance of $91 billion at the midpoint for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which ended December 29, 2018.

The steepest decline in Apple stock came on January 3 after the company revised its revenue guidance by 7.7% to $84 billion, representing a decline of 5% from a year ago.

## Semiconductor suppliers hit by Apple’s weak guidance 

Apple is one of the largest customers in the semiconductor industry. Companies like Qorvo (QRVO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS), and Skyworks (SWKS) depend heavily on the iPhone maker for revenue. Weak revenue from Apple will lower orders from the iPhone maker, thereby impacting suppliers’ earnings. Thus, stocks of the above three companies fell more than 8% on January 3. Broadcom (AVGO) also took a big hit, as it is one of Apple’s biggest suppliers and supplies various components for iPhones.

As the smartphone market slowed, some suppliers reduced their dependence on Apple by diversifying their revenue streams, which mitigated the impact of Apple’s weak guidance on their stocks. The stock of Apple’s sole foundry partner for A12 processors, TSMC (TSM), fell 5.9% on January 3. TSMC has been increasing its exposure to high computing processors. The declines from Apple are likely to be offset by new orders from Qualcomm (QCOM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

The stock of Intel (INTC), Apple’s sole modem supplier, fell 5.5% on January 3, as the latter’s modem business contributes little towards its revenue. Apple’s power management chip supplier, Texas Instruments (TXN), fell 5.9% on the same day, as the latter reduced its exposure to the iPhone maker by diversifying into automotive and industrial markets.

The stocks of the above suppliers could recover from the January 3 fall but are likely to see another fall when Apple releases its fiscal 2019 first-quarter earnings on January 29. Thus, investors should keep an eye on Apple’s upcoming earnings.

Custom-designed chips power top-tier smartphones from  companies such as Apple Inc and Huawei Technologies Ltd. But  they are costly to design and difficult to make, requiring huge  teams of engineers and years to complete, with special design  software that can cost millions of dollars a year.  Ming Zhang founded Mountain View, California-based zGlue Inc  after a career at Intel Corp and the chipmaking  division of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, where he  helped work on Intel's first mobile processors and the designs  for some of Samsung's chips.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zglue-pitches-chiplets-custom-chips-222055301.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-01-07	2019-01-07 20:08:23	TSM	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited	AMD Stock Rose 8% on Ryzen 3000 Series Announcement	"AMD Stock Rose 8% on Ryzen 3000 Series Announcement

## AMD’s stock rockets on Ryzen 3000 Series announcement 

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) started 2019 with the announcement of its new Ryzen 3000 H and U Series CPUs for gaming laptops and ultrathin notebooks at CES 2019 (the Consumer Electronics Show) on January 6. The excitement around the new CPU range saw AMD’s stock rise 19.5% in two days, with almost an 8% increase today. In our article dated December 31, we stated that AMD will be the showstopper at CES 2019 and that its product announcements would significantly increase its stock price.

## Reality different than rumors

AMD’s stock rose even though the product announcements weren’t what had been anticipated. According to the rumor mill, the company was expected to announce its third-generation Ryzen CPUs and second-generation Vega GPUs for desktops. These chips were expected to be built on TSMC’s (TSM) 7nm (nanometer) node. AMD was also expected to offer a hint about its next-generation Navi GPU.

But the reality was different than rumors. AMD launched its second-generation Ryzen 3000 series CPUs for laptops on GlobalFoundries’ 12nm node. AMD claims that its Ryzen 3000 series CPUs are faster than Intel’s (INTC) eighth-generation Core processors. On the GPU front, AMD made no mention of Navi—nor did it announce a 7nm Vega GPU for PCs at CES 2019.

## AMD’s other product announcements 

While AMD didn’t unveil any new GPU, it introduced two new seventh-generation A-series processors—the A6-9220C and the A4-9120C—for Chromebooks. The company also unveiled an entry-level Athlon 300U chip.

AMD’s stock rose as the company expanded its mobile processor portfolio to target all levels of the laptop segment. AMD is likely to grow further in 2019 as it launches 7nm server processors and gains market share from Intel.

Intel (INTC) is spending big on stock buybacks in 2018 driven by large cash flows coming from high PC and data center revenue.  Intel is expected to spend $15.5 billion on capex, as it has allocated an additional $1 billion worth of capital to increasing the capacity of its 14 nm (nanometer) manufacturing node.  Next year could be heavy on capital spending, as Intel plans to begin production on its next-generation 10 nm manufacturing node and produce nonvolatile memory chips in-house.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/909e209f-2b6b-3c4c-8bb9-45a6e14f63ac/what-factors-could-influence.html?.tsrc=rss

The group's fourth-quarter outlook, however, was modestly softer, with fourth quarter revenues projections of between $9.35 million and $9.45 million over the key holiday season, which usually sees a big uptick in iPhone sales from TSMC's biggest and most important customer."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b2fc7699-b799-3f95-a6e6-be8f7d109aaf/tsmc-posts-modest-q3-profit.html?.tsrc=rss

In the previous part of this series, we saw that Intel (INTC) launched it ninth-generation Core processors even though it’s facing yield issues on its 10 nm (nanometer) node.  Intel has already delayed the launch of its 10 nm products from the 2016 holiday season to the 2019 holiday season, allowing rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (or TSMC) (TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF) to go ahead of it in terms of manufacturing technology.  With the 7 nm node, AMD has tweaked its strategy and is bringing server CPUs first, which could be followed by client CPUs. On the other hand, Intel could launch its client CPUs first and then server CPUs, although the gap between the two launches would be short due to delays in the 10 nm node.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/87c1f761-1ac4-37f6-8a34-67d7a0068580/when-will-intel-launch-its.html?.tsrc=rss

Its only other rival in the market is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Intel’s 14nm (nanometer) node supply constraints opened a window of opportunity for AMD to sell its CPUs to more consumers and increase its market share, as it did during the GPU (graphics processing unit) shortage.

Some analysts stated that the delay in the launch of 10nm products shifted the demand for the 14nm products, which created a supply shortage.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/19e312ed-055f-3ea4-9ecb-f97af8e2981c/rumors%3A-intel-could-outsource.html?.tsrc=rss

As a result, a window of opportunity has opened for rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to gain market share and see better-than-expected earnings.  Although its products have delivered better price-to-performance metrics, Intel still offers some of the highest-performing CPUs.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/73caedfe-2e75-3002-ae2a-226532379b0d/intel%E2%80%99s-cpu-shortages-to.html?.tsrc=rss

Shares in TSMC shares rose 3.8 per cent on Wednesday to their highest point since March.  The move by GlobalFoundries, the world’s second-biggest foundry by sales, means production of the most advanced processors will be left to TSMC and Samsung, as the rising cost of developing ever smaller and more powerful chips prices out the competition.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f093247e-c517-36d0-97d5-3b09e4c839a9/%5B%24%24%5D-globalfoundries%E2%80%99-exit-a.html?.tsrc=rss

Applied Materials’ (AMAT) performance is an indicator of the overall semiconductor industry’s outlook, as it supplies chipmakers manufacturing equipment to build new capacity or upgrade semiconductor manufacturing technology. Semiconductor investors were already concerned that the weakness in smartphone demand and new technologies would encourage chipmakers to reduce their equipment purchases. The decline in NAND (negative AND) prices added to these concerns.  AMAT’s weaker guidance for fiscal Q4 2018 fueled investors’ concerns that the chip industry’s two-year-long growth trend is beginning to slow.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/35cb8b8a-88fa-33ed-9e07-0b82338c14fb/why-amat%E2%80%99s-weak-guidance.html?.tsrc=rss

It hasn’t been long, but a small Israeli security company called CTS Labs has discovered another threat in AMD’s CPUs (central processing unit).  On March 12, 2018, in its whitepaper, CTS Labs stated, “The vulnerabilities we have discovered allow bad actors who infiltrated the network to persist in it, surviving computer reboots and re-installation of the operating system, while remaining virtually undetectable by most endpoint security solutions.” It named these flaws RYZENFALL, MASTERKEY, FALLOUT, and CHIMERA, with the last flaw being a potential national security concern.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/61f6ae0d-dc4a-3e71-9248-30e4a9443d57/new-security-threat-detected.html?.tsrc=rss

After describing problems with getting adequate “throughput” of silicon wafers in ASML’s machines, Mullane wrote “with no near-term fixes to the throughput issues alone, there is a high risk to ASML that EUV implementation into high volume manufacturing could be delayed again."" Part of the problem, apparently, is that Apple, a big customer of TSM, which fabricates chips for the iPhone, doesn’t want to have to pay extra money it would cost TSM to make chips using the ASML technology, known as “EUV,” or “extreme ultraviolet”:  Our latest checks suggest that AAPL is not interested in paying more for 7nm+ shrink for their next generation iPhone models in 2019, given the early price increases that TSM has quoted."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f2639e06-52c9-3652-a64f-b8774701b7b9/apple-clouds-asml-earnings.html?.tsrc=rss

Just this month INTC signed a deal to build 3-D memory chips there. Its ties to China are deep, an investment of $1.5 billion.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-intc-could-huge-093155162.html?.tsrc=rss
