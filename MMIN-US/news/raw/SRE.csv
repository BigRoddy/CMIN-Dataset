2021-04-22	2021-04-22 18:31:53	SRE	Sempra	U.S. Gas Utility Ordered to Return Cash Used in Climate Lobbying	(Bloomberg) -- California regulators ruled that Sempra Energy’s Southern California Gas misused customer money to lobby against energy-efficiency standards, and ordered the utility to refund those amounts to ratepayers.SoCalGas, the largest natural gas distributor in the U.S., used customer funds for several years to advocate against stricter state energy codes that would have curbed natural gas use, according to a preliminary decision filed Wednesday by an administrative law judge at the California Public Utilities Commission. The judge also found that SoCalGas used ratepayer money to fight against proposals by cities to limit gas use in buildings.The judge stopped short of ordering a financial penalty sought by the state’s consumer advocate and environmental groups, which had called for a $255 million fine against the utility. Parties can appeal the decision and the five-member commission can review it before it’s finalized.“By failing to impose penalties the commission encourages the very bad acts for which it finds SoCalGas guilty,” said Maya Chupkov, a spokeswoman for the Public Advocate’s Office of the commission.The decision comes as California seeks a pathway to become carbon-neutral by 2045 in its effort to combat the worst impacts of climate change. To reach such a goal, the state will need to sharply reduce its use of fossil fuels including natural gas.Southern California Gas has said it supports the state’s climate goals and has pledged to become carbon-neutral by the state’s target date by replacing its fossil gas with hydrogen and gas from renewable sources such as diary farms and landfills.“We welcome the clarification provided and we appreciate the finding that no violations, fines or penalties are warranted,” SoCalGas spokesman Chris Gilbride said regarding the commission’s proposed decision.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gas-utility-ordered-return-183153698.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-04-05	2021-04-05 14:37:46	SRE	Sempra	KKR to Buy Stake in Sempra Infrastructure for $3.37 Billion	(Bloomberg) -- KKR & Co. agreed to pay $3.37 billion for a 20% stake in a Sempra Energy unit comprising the U.S. company’s infrastructure assets, including a liquefied natural gas project and a Mexican renewables and pipelines operator.It’s the latest example of a broader push among U.S. utilities eschewing diversification to focus on providing electricity and gas to homes and businesses. The deal values Sempra Infrastructure Partners at about $25.2 billion, including expected asset-related debt, Sempra said Monday in a statement.“This is an example of Sempra focusing more on their U.S. utility business and simplifying their infrastructure business,” said Paul Patterson, an analyst at Glenrock Associates LLC. “Over the past few years, there’s been a general move from utilities to focus more on their traditional domestic utility business and less emphasis on their international business.”Selling the stake also sets a market value for Sempra’s infrastructure unit, said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. “That means that Sempra’s banks, its lenders, can look at this and perhaps improve how they think about the company’s balance sheet.”Sempra rose 2.1% to $134.62 at 10:24 a.m., bringing the stock’s year-to-date gain to 5.6%.The move comes four months after Sempra announced the creation of the new unit to simplify its structure and aid development of gas and renewables projects. The company, which recently announced a $32 billion capital-spending plan focused on its Texas and California utilities, plans to use the proceeds to fund growth of its U.S. utilities and strengthen its balance sheet.“Combining our resources with KKR improves our ability to capture new investment opportunities in cleaner forms of energy and the critical infrastructure that stores and transports it,” Sempra Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey W. Martin said in the statement.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Other utilities could follow Sempra’s lead. Its move is similar to Duke’s recent sale of 20% of its Indiana utility and, in both cases, the companies raise capital from stable business to fund new projects. Utilities see major growth opportunities in the core businesses, especially with the prospect of President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan.”- Kit Konolige, BI senior utilities analyst.Read full report here.In December, Sempra announced it was buying out minority investors in Mexico’s Infraestructura Energetica Nova for about $2 billion. Sempra Infrastructure also includes Sempra LNG, which is developing a terminal to export the fuel from Mexico.Sempra has sold off multiple overseas assets in recent years, including its Chilean and Peruvian businesses to Chinese firms. Other U.S. utilities have made plans to sell assets to focus on their electric utilities, including Exelon Corp. and CenterPoint Energy Inc.KKR will invest via its Global Infrastructure Investors Funds. The deal is expected to close by mid-2021.(Updates with analyst comment in third, fourth paragraphs; share price in fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kkr-buy-stake-sempra-infrastructure-110941087.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-01-29	2021-01-29 09:00:07	SRE	Sempra	With Natural Gas in Peril, Pipeline Owners Look to Hydrogen	(Bloomberg) -- Three million miles of natural gas pipelines criss-cross the U.S., and the fight against climate change could render them all obsolete.The last two weeks alone illustrate the stakes. President Joe Biden canceled the permit for the $9 billion Keystone XL oil pipeline on his first day in office, a clear signal any new fossil fuel pipeline project in the U.S. will face long odds. His climate envoy, former Secretary of State John Kerry, warned that natural gas pipelines could become “stranded assets” within 30 years as the administration seeks to end carbon emissions from power plants. And NextEra Energy Inc. wrote off $1.2 billion of its investment in the Mountain Valley gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia, which has been tied up in regulatory and legal delays.So pipeline owners are eyeing another, possibly future-proof fuel: hydrogen.Unlike natural gas, hydrogen can be burned without pumping carbon dioxide into the air. Run it through a fuel cell to generate electricity and the only waste is water; produce hydrogen using electrolyzers powered by solar plants or wind farms and it becomes a way to store massive amounts of renewable energy—far more than any of today’s batteries can hold. And the best part for pipeline companies: getting it where it needs to be, in bulk, could require the same basic infrastructure that now carries natural gas.It could, in other words, be a savior for the businesses behind our fossil fuel infrastructure. Even as those same companies insist gas will play a role for years to come, many of them are talking up the potential of hydrogen. They’re launching projects to blend small portions of hydrogen into their existing networks to see how the equipment behaves. They’re running experiments to strip hydrogen out of that blended gas, for use at specific locations. And they’re exploring how they might eventually transition from one fuel to the other. “We see our gas network as an energy system that delivers molecules to our customers, and by 2050, the source of those molecules will be very different,” said Sheri Givens, vice president of U.S. regulatory and customer strategy at National Grid. “We see hydrogen as the low-carbon molecule of the 21st century.”But the hype is far from the reality.Some climate activists battling the industry over gas bans call the companies’ talk of hydrogen greenwashing. Gas businesses are downplaying the difficulty of switching from one fuel to the other, they say, trying to convince investors they’ll still be relevant in a zero-carbon world. “The industry’s always putting out things that might happen—if we just keep using gas right now,” said Matt Vespa, staff attorney with Earthjustice.So far, there’s more actual hydrogen activity in Europe and the U.K. than there is in the U.S., where some companies have expressed interest without revealing many specific plans. The then-chief commercial officer of Energy Transfer, the largest U.S. pipeline operator by revenue, last fall called hydrogen “a head scratcher” that, at least for now, doesn’t make sense. “At this point, we don't see anything close on the horizon around hydrogen,” said Marshall S. McCrea, now the company’s co-chief executive officer.The questions involved in hydrogen transport go beyond merely the will to pursue it. Gas pipeline owners can’t simply switch from one gas to the other without cutting off existing customers, so any transition would start with blending hydrogen into the existing stream of fuel. “We see hydrogen as the low-carbon molecule of the 21st century”But even mixing the two—let alone replacing one with the other—poses technical problems that would need to be overcome. Compressors designed to move natural gas don’t work well with hydrogen, the lightest of all elements, and would likely need to be replaced. Some types of steel pipe become brittle and crack when exposed to hydrogen over time, whereas polymer pipes can easily handle hydrogen.“We must investigate this for every single pipe we put hydrogen into,” said Jack Brouwer, director of the advanced power and energy program at the University of California, Irvine, “but it’s a phenomenon we can manage because it’s slow.” Problem pipes and compressors could be replaced over the course of years, he said. Or pipes could be protected with coatings applied from the inside by robotic devices called pigs that are currently used for pipeline inspection and maintenance. “Just put some spray-painting equipment on that same device, and there you go, right down the whole pipeline,” he said.Pilot projects around the world have been designed to flush out problems and give companies a better sense of what other obstacles might lie ahead. In California, for instance, Sempra Energy has planned a series of demonstration projects that will test various concentrations of hydrogen in fuel blends—possibly up to 20%—in isolated pipeline segments made of polyethylene, steel, and a combination of the two. Another project will test technology to strip and compress hydrogen from the blended gas.“Since the infrastructure already exists and serves customers, we would submit that it’s in the public interest to keep using that infrastructure to help us decarbonize,” said Jonathan Peress, senior director of regulatory affairs for Sempra’s Southern California Gas Co.In July, a group of eleven European gas infrastructure companies presented a plan to build a dedicated hydrogen transport network, saying existing gas infrastructure can be modified to transport hydrogen at an affordable cost. The hydrogen network is set to reach 4,225 miles (6,800 kilometers) by 2030 and nearly 14,300 miles (23,000 kilometers) by 2040, three-quarters of which will consist of converted natural gas pipelines.National Grid in the U.K. has launched a series of hydrogen demonstration projects, including using the gas to heat homes, and has discussed establishing a hydrogen pipeline transmission network connecting the industrial centers along Britain’s east coast. In the U.S., the company is partnering with six national labs and other companies on a gas-mixing research effort called HyBlend.“The one thing that we have in the U.S. that we should be very proud of and is of huge value to us is we have a tremendous natural gas transportation and storage network,” said Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of the Williams Companies, Inc., an energy infrastructure giant whose core business is natural gas. “It's a tremendous opportunity for us to really take advantage of and to make hydrogen more economical.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/natural-gas-peril-pipeline-owners-090007907.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-12-24	2020-12-24 22:46:45	SRE	Sempra	California Christmas Eve Blackout Ends as Winds Give Way to Rain	(Bloomberg) -- After cutting power to more than 26,000 homes and businesses during a Christmas Eve wind storm, Southern California utilities started restoring service Thursday afternoon as the gusts gave way to the region’s first rain this month.It marked a welcome change in a region that has battled drought and fires for much of the year, and where one of the nation’s worst coronavirus outbreaks has cast a pall over the Christmas holiday.The blackout, intended to prevent live power lines from sparking fires in the high winds, affected far fewer people than feared. Utilities in advance of the storm had warned they might need to shut off electricity to more than 200,000 homes and businesses, or about 600,000 people, considering the size of the average household.With gusts above 60 miles (96 kilometers) per hour, the Santa Ana winds fanned one new fire overnight, a blaze in northern San Diego County that quickly grew to 3,000 acres and forced some residents to evacuate. But the winds faded after daybreak, and by afternoon, light rain showers drifted across the region.By mid-afternoon, only 3,000 customer accounts of Edison International’s Southern California utility remained without power, down from a peak of 19,902. Sempra Energy’s utility serving San Diego County had 346 homes and businesses without electricity, after cutting power to 6,797 earlier in the day.California utilities have increasingly resorted to switching off power lines in advance of high winds rather than risk live wires falling into dry brush and sparking fires. And while December is typically one of California’s wettest months, a La Nina in the Pacific Ocean has shifted weather patterns, starving Los Angeles of rain through the fall and keeping fire danger high. All of California is abnormally dry, and drought covers more than 95% of it, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-670-000-californians-face-000820203.html?.tsrc=rss

(SoCalGas) today applauded the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) for including use of renewable natural gas (RNG) in the latest beta version of its LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) green building rating system. RNG is a low-carbon fuel produced from waste that can be used just like traditional natural gas. With the new system, a project may utilize RNG to earn LEED points by capturing and using biogas on site, sourcing biogas from a third party, or by purchasing biogas to store in the project's own storage system. The RNG can be used for heating, hot water and cooking in commercial buildings, and for stoves, clothes dryers, water heaters, fireplaces and heating in homes. The number of LEED points determines the level of LEED certification the project can achieve.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/socalgas-applauds-recognition-renewable-natural-182600292.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-17	2020-11-17 15:09:27	SRE	Sempra	P/E Ratio Insights for Sempra Energy	Right now, Sempra Energy Inc. (NYSE: SRE) share price is at $135.43, after a 0.09% decrease. Over the past month, the stock increased by 4.43%, but over the past year, it actually fell by 8.41%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio. The stock is currently above from its 52 week low by 53.90%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Multi-Utilities stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year.  The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings. Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries. Sempra Energy Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 21.24 of the Multi-Utilities industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued.  Price to earnings ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance. Depending on the earnings makeup of a company, investors can become unable to attain key insights from trailing earnings.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * P/E Ratio Insights for Southern  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For November 17, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-08	2020-10-08 21:15:10	SRE	Sempra	Chemical Coast Braces for Third Pummeling This Storm Season	(Bloomberg) -- An already turbulent hurricane season is poised to deliver the third blow in just six weeks to the pandemic-battered natural gas export and chemical industries along the U.S. Gulf Coast.Hurricane Delta has strengthened into a Category 3 storm as it barrels across the Gulf of Mexico on a course for Cameron Parish, Louisiana, a nexus of gas exporters and petrochemical plants. Delta will be the 10th named storm to hit the American mainland in a hyperactive hurricane season when it crashes ashore on Friday evening.Fueled by booming shale extraction that flooded the region with inexpensive gas, the coastline of Louisiana and southeast Texas is home to two of the nation’s six liquefied gas export terminals, as well as a quarter of U.S. oil-refining capacity and half the continent’s output of ethylene used in plastics, according to Independent Commodity Intelligence Services.Rapid investment in new and expanded petrochemical capacity during the past decade has delivered good-paying jobs to an impoverished, mostly agricultural region. But with that has come increased risks to life, limb and the environment.“It is very clear that southwest Louisiana is going to get more of a punch from this than we would like to see,” Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards told reporters during a media briefing.On its current track, Delta will clip Cheniere Energy Inc.’s Sabine Pass LNG terminal, the largest in the U.S., as well as Sempra Energy’s Cameron LNG facility. Both complexes are still at varying stages of recovery from Hurricane Laura in late August and Tropical Storm Beta in September.Knocked out of service by Laura, Cameron LNG has now shut down for a second time in six weeks, the company said Thursday. The closure came one day after the three-unit facility made its first drops of liquefied gas since the Category 4 storm cut across a vast swath of southwest Louisiana.Force MajeureSempra declared a force majeure event on the Cameron Interstate Pipeline, which feeds its Cameron LNG plant. Gas flows to Cameron were down by 98% as of Thursday afternoon, according to a Bloomberg NEF estimate.Meanwhile, Kinder Morgan Inc. declared a force majeure event and shut down Louisiana Line, one of eight pipe networks that supply Cheniere’s LNG complex. Gas flows to the Cheniere facility fell 13% on Wednesday and another 13% by Thursday afternoon, Bloomberg NEF estimates show.Cheniere plans to use a skeleton crew to continue operations, the company said in a email.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Hurricane Delta’s impact on U.S. LNG exports should be temporary as vessels avoid the storm and cargo loadings are delayed, in our view, but Sempra’s Cameron facility could take longer to restart.”\-- Talon Custer, BI analystRead the research here.The Sabine Pass plant enjoys an advantage over Cameron during major storms in that it’s self-sufficient in electricity supplies. The liquefaction plant and its docks were able to return to service within a week after Laura.Almost half a dozen LNG tankers that had been anchored in the Gulf of Mexico awaiting access to Sabine Pass or Cameron moved to safer waters late Wednesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.This storm season has added to the woes of U.S. LNG producers already battered by coronavirus lockdowns that curbed global gas demand. As a result of that slump, there were more than 110 canceled LNG cargoes through the summer season, data intelligence firm Kpler reported.(Updates storm’s strength in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chemical-coast-braces-third-pummeling-211510579.html?.tsrc=rss

Gas prices surged over 60% in Europe and Asia last month, causing U.S. LNG exports to jump from a 21-month low of 3.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in July to 3.7 bcfd in August and an expected 3.8 bcfd in September, according to federal data.  Several U.S. LNG export plants stepped up to supply more of the super-cooled fuel even though Cameron LNG's facility in Louisiana remains shut due to lingering power problems after Hurricane Laura slammed into the Gulf Coast in late August.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-lng-exports-rise-coronavirus-192129427.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-31	2020-08-31 11:00:16	SRE	Sempra	The Gas Industry’s Survival Plan: Make Fuel From Cow Poop	(Bloomberg) -- Polly is a 10-year-old black-and-white Holstein cow, the oldest in a herd of about 300 on the Bar-Way Farm in Deerfield, Mass. Together they produce 2,000 gallons of milk each day. They also make enough poop to fill about two garbage trucks. The farm makes money off of both.In 2014, Bar-Way began working with Vanguard Renewables to install a biodigester, which uses specialized bacteria to convert organic material—for example, cow poop—into biogas, a versatile fuel. Once it’s purified, this biomethane, also known as renewable natural gas (RNG), is chemically identical to the main ingredient in the fossil-based natural gas that comes out of your stove or heats your water.“My grandfather always told me that to be successful, you’ve got to use every asset you have to its fullest,” says Peter Melnik, whose family has owned Bar-Way Farm Inc. for 101 years. He won’t disclose how much he’s profited from the arrangement, but he will say it’s made the business “that much more viable.”“Without a doubt, small family farming in the United States is incredibly tough,” he adds.So is pumping natural gas, at least these days. Under intense pressure from investors, customers, and climate activists, three interstate gas pipelines worth about $10 billion were canceled, choking off Appalachian producers’ access to new Northeast and Southeast customers. More than 30 cities have banned gas in new buildings since July 2019.“It’s gotten to the point they need a proactive decarbonization strategy,” says Jigar Shah, co-founder of clean energy financier Generate Capital Inc., one of the largest RNG owners in the country. “Natural gas producers now believe their growth prospects are more limited—to the degree that some people said we should be planning for the obsolescence of the natural gas utility.”That’s where renewable natural gas is supposed to come in. Bovine waste is typically stored in vast open lagoons that emit methane—a greenhouse gas more than 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide over 20 years— making agricultural waste the single biggest contributor to the country’s total methane emissions from human activity. Both biogas and fossil natural gas are mostly methane, and though they burn more cleanly than the megapolluter coal, they still emit carbon dioxide. But by diverting cow poop into biodigesters in the process of making RNG, gas companies argue, the effect is a net climate win. Virginia-based utility giant Dominion Energy Inc. claims that supplying only 4% of its customers with biogas would be enough to offset the emission from its entire gas system.That’s the type of math that irks Matt Vespa, an attorney for the nonprofit climate litigation group Earthjustice. “Just 4% of the gas needs to be renewable gas, and then all of the sudden you have 100% clean energy,” he says, “requires some shoddy assumptions”—for instance, that all the methane coming out of all those lagoons is inevitable in factory farming. But there are plenty of other ways to solve this problem that don’t extend our reliance on polluting fuels, Vespa says.Earthjustice is far from the only climate organization ringing the alarm bells about RNG. Mark Kresowik, a deputy director of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign, says RNG is a costly distraction that will only slow the energy industry’s transition away from hydrocarbons. (The Sierra Club has received funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charitable organization created by Michael R. Bloomberg, founder and owner of Bloomberg News parent company Bloomberg LP.) “This is the last gasp of the gas industry. They know that electrification is superior,” Kresowik says. “If you go down that dead-end route, it increases the cost to consumers in the long run.”That said, getting rid of gas won’t be easy. It’s enjoyed unprecedented growth over the past decade as the boom in shale oil and gas production made costs plummet. Today gas accounts for about a third of America’s total energy consumption, and it’s projected to rise to 40% this year, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show.Nationwide, RNG could be used to displace 13% of total U.S. gas demand by 2040, according to a study commissioned by the American Gas Foundation last year, along with EIA data. Generate Capital’s Shah, who keeps a map of all viable U.S. RNG spots, says that cap is likely closer to 3% of U.S. gas demand. Still, that’s a sizable market. “People have a hard time understanding what 3% is,” but that’s enough to put RNG on par with where solar is today, he says.Over the years, RNG has had an uneasy relationship with the fossil fuel industry, much as solar and wind have clashed with traditional utilities. It’s also a tougher sell as an investment: A typical RNG project costs about $17 million, but can top out as high as $100 million, according to industry lobbying group RNG Coalition. That’s compared to the $6 to $8.5 million price tag for an Appalachian gas well, which can also pump many times more gas in a day than a digester can produce, according to BloombergNEF. The name “renewable natural gas” itself is a marketing term, coined a decade ago to play off the name recognition of its fossil fuel twin.But the name also points to what makes RNG many gas companies’ lifeline of choice: They can use their existing infrastructure to deliver it. “The more you deploy renewables, the more you need the gas grid,” says Jonathan Peress, senior director of regulatory affairs with Sempra Energy’s SoCalGas, the largest U.S. gas utility, who was formerly senior director of energy markets and utility regulation at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group.SoCalGas has been campaigning the state to embrace RNG amid a push to electrify buildings. So far the effort appears to be paying off. The California Public Utilities Commission is considering a rule that would require the state’s gas utilities to procure a certain percentage of RNG. SoCalGas is also pushing for an RNG credit for both residential and commercial customers, and it’s announced plans to replace 5% of its gas supply with RNG by 2022 and 20% by 2030.California is by far the biggest market for RNG, but others are coming up. Over the summer, Oregon finalized rules that will allow utilities to supply as much as 30% of gas customers with RNG by 2050, and several other states are considering paying fees to those adding RNG to the grid, similar to existing credits for wind and solar power. Dominion Energy announced it will invest as much as $2 billion in RNG over the next decade, in part through partnerships with Vanguard Renewables and pork-producing giant Smithfield Foods Inc. Utility owner Duke Energy Corp. made its first investment in the renewable gas sector by acquiring a minority stake in SustainRNG in July.Melnik started looking into biodigesters more than a decade ago with other Massachusetts farmers as a way to diversify their income and make their operations more sustainable. He spent more than five years researching digesters, traveling to plants in Germany and across the U.S., to figure out the right technology to use, then how to pay for it and permit it. It was through the financing process that he came across Vanguard.Each week, Melnik adds about 175 tons of manure, mixed with about 15 to 20 trucks’ worth of food waste from 19 Whole Foods Market stores, a Cabot Creamery plant, New England Natural Bakers, Tree House Brewing, the MGM Springfield casino, and Hood ice cream. What’s left behind is a liquid fertilizer, which can then be further processed to create fluffy dry bedding for the barn. Polly, the grande dame of the herd, had most of her joint pain disappear once Melnik subbed in the biodigester bedding for the hardwood chips she used to sleep on. She’s now one of the farm’s top milk producers. Extracting the methane eliminates almost all of the odor, so neighbors no longer complain about the scent.The farm has drawn visitors from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; utility representatives; national, state, and local regulatory officials; and businessmen from Japan to learn about the process, according to Vanguard Chief Executive Officer John Hanselman. The company currently runs biodigesters on five Massachusetts farms, including Bar-Way, and is in the final stages of setting up another one in Vermont; yet another one planned for upstate New York is in the permitting stage.“Every farm that we worked with and met with, they all want to be good stewards of the land—they understand climate change better than anybody,” says Hanselman, who’s also working on projects in Georgia and Texas.The thing with the bedding, though, is just a happy accident. “We knew we would be able to get the energy out, we knew we would be able to recycle food waste, but we didn’t know how valuable the bedding material is,” Hanselman says. “It’s like unintended consequences.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gas-industry-survival-plan-fuel-110016467.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-26	2020-08-26 09:37:01	SRE	Sempra	Hurricane Laura Strengthening Rapidly to Category 4 Storm	(Bloomberg) -- Hurricane Laura is poised to become a life-threatening Category 4 storm before coming ashore along the Texas-Louisiana coast this week, potentially inflicting as much as $18 billion in damage on the region and keeping some of America’s largest oil refineries shut for months.Laura’s winds were forecast to peak at 130 miles (209 kilometers) per hour over the Gulf of Mexico, but may weaken slightly before hitting the coast on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm has already disrupted offshore oil and natural gas production, shut a third of the Gulf Coast’s refining capacity, halted exports and prompted mandatory evacuations. It’s set to be the first major system to hit the Gulf Coast since Michael in 2018.“Laura has become a formidable hurricane,” the NHC said on its website. A “life-threatening storm surge with large and dangerous waves is expected to produce potentially catastrophic damage from San Luis Pass, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.”Even when it was forecast to become no more powerful than Category 3, Laura was predicted to cause anywhere between $6 billion and $18 billion in losses, according to Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. About 10% to 12% of U.S. refining capacity could be shut for more than six months, he said.“It is going to be a hard hitter, and it is going to cause some devastating impacts,” said Jim Rouiller, lead meteorologist with the Energy Weather Group. “Louisiana is going to have a lot of damage with this storm.”After Laura rips across the Gulf Coast, it will leave a path of destruction through the Mississippi Valley before turning on the Mid-Atlantic region that just recovered from Hurricane Isaias, Rouiller said. There is a possibility Laura will re-intensify once it makes it to Maryland, New Jersey and possibly New York, he said.The tropical threat has prompted more than 84% of oil output and nearly 61% of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico to be shut, according to the Interior Department’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.Gulf Coast refineries and petrochemical plants are often located in low-lying areas vulnerable to flooding. In 2017, an Arkema SA chemical plant about 25 miles east of Houston had a fire and explosion after it was flooded by Hurricane Harvey. Last September, Exxon shut its Beaumont refinery in Texas because of flooding from Tropical Storm Imelda.Laura could push sea levels as high as 15 feet (4.6 meters) in the Sabine Pass area and along parts of the Texas coast where the Henry Hub is located, the hurricane center said at 5 a.m. New York time. Storm surge kills nearly half of all people who die in hurricanes.This surge could penetrate as much as 30 miles inland from the immediate coastline in southwestern Louisiana and far southeastern Texas, Jack Beven, a senior hurricane specialist at the center, wrote in his forecast. “Actions to protect life and property should be rushed to completion this evening, as water levels will begin to rise on Wednesday,” he wrote.The last hurricane to hit Texas as a Category 4 storm was Harvey in 2017, which came ashore and then got pinned in place by larger weather patterns, causing it to send record rains across the eastern half of the state for days. The last hurricane to hit Texas was Hanna in July.Some of the largest U.S. refineries are winding down in advance of Laura, shutting in nearly 2.9 million barrels a day of capacity. That’s about 30% of U.S. Gulf Coast refining capacity, according to Lipow Oil Associates.Energy platforms in the Gulf of Mexico that account for as much as 17% of America’s oil production and about 3% of gas output are designed to withstand storms of this magnitude.The energy industry is “very well prepared for this type of storm,” U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. President Donald Trump has ordered him to make the Strategic Petroleum Reserve available for such situations, he said.The city of Port Arthur, Texas, will order some residents to flee the storm starting Tuesday, according to the city’s website. Jefferson County in Texas put in place a mandatory evacuation order for all except essential personnel, it said in a statement. Houston-area government officials urged resident of the city’s eastern suburbs to evacuate.Laura will be a record seventh system to hit the U.S. by August, and more are coming, Rouiller said.Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

2020-08-22	2020-08-22 11:30:00	SRE	Sempra	The Day California Went Dark Was a Crisis Years in the Making	(Bloomberg) -- Signs of a problem within California’s power system emerged a full day before the blackouts hit.Trader Dov Quint sat in his basement outside Boulder, Colorado, scouring the state’s day-ahead power market for opportunities to profit from California’s heat wave. He saw something strange: Prices for electricity to be delivered the next day – the day of the blackouts – were nearing $1,000 a megawatt-hour, more than 26 times higher than last year’s average.The last time that happened, in July 2018, the forecast for demand had been much higher. Something was amiss -- were energy supplies lower than usual?In Folsom, California, system operators for the state’s vast electrical grid were looking at the same numbers -- and forecasting a significant power shortfall starting at 6 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 14.They had a full day to act. And yet, when Friday evening rolled around, nearly 2 million Californians were plunged into darkness in the first rolling blackouts to hit the state since the energy crisis 20 years ago. Without warning, utilities cut power to blocks of communities in a bid to save the state’s electric grid from cascading power failures amid the worst heat wave in generations.There’s plenty of blame to go around, from the state’s grid operator who failed to prevent the crisis in spite of market signals presaging it, to regulators who for years ignored pleas from power generators to line up more emergency resources, to a human-led climate crisis that’s producing extreme, unpredictable weather. Breakdowns across the board resulted in a power emergency that could have implications for how the state manages electricity from here on out.On that Friday morning, grid operators weren’t panicking -- yet. While the heat was certainly driving up demand, they had seen far worse days, such as in July 2006 when demand hit an all-time high of 50.3 gigawatts during a deadly heatwave.The California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state’s grid, asked neighboring utilities if they had any extra power to spare, John Phipps, director of real-time operations at the ISO, said at a public meeting the following Monday. But there was none. If utilities had any extra supplies, they were keeping them to themselves in case they needed the power as the heat intensified. So the ISO sent out an alert asking residents to conserve.108 DegreesBut as temperatures rose, peaking at 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 Celsius) in Sacramento, demand climbed and supply looked more and more inadequate.Gas users began pulling fuel from the Aliso Canyon storage facility, operated by Sempra Energy’s SoCalGas utility and which supplies gas-fired power generators. That was an unusual move for the time of year, according to traders, but the supplies likely cushioned the shock to power prices in Southern California.At 2:56 p.m., a gas-fired plant unexpectedly tripped, sucking 475 megawatts of power from the grid. The state ordered power suppliers to fire up reserve gas units to make up the difference, Phipps said.But there wasn’t enough reserve gas generation to go around. The state, guided by one of the most ambitious climate policies in the U.S., had retired 9 gigawatts of gas capacity -- enough to power 6.8 million homes -- over the past five years. The state is also looking to shut down Aliso Canyon, which has been operating at reduced capacity after the biggest gas leak in U.S. history was discovered there in 2015.The ISO had been warning state regulators for years that there weren’t enough power supplies during the net peak period in summer and that it faced a potential shortfall of 4.7 gigawatts in the evening hours starting in 2020, said Steve Berberich, head of the grid operator. While the California Public Utilities Commission, which is responsible for making sure the state’s big investor-owned utilities buy enough power, has approved 3.3 gigawatts of new capacity, that won’t come online until 2021.READ: California’s Next Electricity Headache Is a Looming ShortageThe commission pushed back on Berberich’s comments, saying utilities and other power distributors had procured the resources that were required to meet the demand forecasts on Friday and Saturday, according to spokeswoman Terrie Prosper.“This is a shared responsibility, and we are working with our sister agencies to better understand why this occurred,” she said.Solar SetsBy the late afternoon Friday, when the state’s substantial solar production began to drop off as the sun set, California ISO grid operators in its control room in Folsom knew they were in trouble.The renewable supply was falling, and there wasn’t enough gas to replace it. The only recourse left was to import power from neighboring states. Unfortunately, imports on a major transmission line connecting Northern California to resources in the Pacific Northwest had been curtailed as grid operators across the region lined up supplies due to the extreme heat, according to Wood Mackenzie analyst John McMahon and the ISO.Another problem emerged, too: In order to import power through the Energy Imbalance Market, which schedules deliveries across regions in real-time, California had to pass what’s called a flexible ramping sufficiency test -- a way of proving that it isn’t overly dependent on imports to meet demand.The ISO failed the ramping test at 15-minute intervals from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m., according to data reviewed by Bloomberg. That reduced imports by about 446 megawatts during the peak demand hour.The grid operator had warned about imports before, saying in June that the state could be vulnerable to blackouts if there was a regional heat wave that limited supplies from neighboring states.“We have told regulators over and over again that imports were drying up and more imports should be contracted for,” Berberich said. “That was rebuffed.”The commission made changes to the way it’s forecasting imported energy that will go into effect in 2021, said Prosper.Rolling BlackoutsPower prices surged, making that Friday the most profitable day ever to sell electricity from a gas-fired plant to the grid -- until the following Monday, when prices rose even more, according to McMahon.With no more resources to tap, the shift manager in Folsom declared a Level 3 emergency at 6:36 p.m. -- which meant the state needed to use rolling blackouts to keep the whole grid from crashing. It was the first time California had to use such an extreme measure since the energy crisis of 2000 and 2001, when hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses went dark, power prices surged to a record and the state’s largest utility was forced into bankruptcy.Utilities Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. cut power within minutes, using software that rotated outages in blocks throughout their service territories. They had little time to warn customers what was coming.In Santa Clarita, the ventilation system at the Salt Creek Grille tripped and the eatery quickly filled with smoke, killing 70% of that night’s business. Forty miles away, 82-year-old Bob Proulx and his wife found themselves trapped in a more than 90-degree house when their air conditioner unexpectedly shut off and the garage door wouldn’t open. Further south, Yasmine Hairat looked up from her laptop to find every light in her neighborhood had gone dark.“We had no notice,” said Jennifer Chadwick, director of sales and marketing for the Salt Creek Grille. “We looked at each other and said, ‘Oh my God another thing. Can anything else happen?’”The lights were only out for a few hours, but the blackouts weren’t over yet -- and they added to a long list of miseries for Californians already grappling with the most coronavirus cases in the country, the worst unemployment rate in the West, and rampant wildfires displacing tens of thousands of people.Round TwoOn Saturday, it happened all over again.Grid operators began the day confident they could avoid another round of outages. Demand was lower than the day before, and supplies appeared sufficient. But shortly after 5 p.m., a 1-gigawatt wind farm suddenly went down. An hour later, a natural gas unit shut. Nearly 1 million people lost power.Over the next few days, as the heat wave persisted, the risk of more blackouts loomed large. At one point, the ISO warned it might have to shed 4.4 gigawatts, blacking out as many as 10 million people. But by then, big electricity users had started cutting back their energy use in respond to personal pleas from people in Governor Gavin Newsom’s office. It was enough to put an end to the outages, for now.In a letter sent to Newsom late Wednesday, the heads of the agencies that oversee the state’s electricity system said they would investigate what went wrong. One question repeatedly comes up. Why did this happen when California has seen much hotter days, and much higher demand? Put simply, experts say, it was a problem years in the making -- from killing gas plants without replacing them to designing a market that’s more focused on thwarting manipulation than incentivizing back-up generation.Regulators, grid operators, utilities and industry experts all saw this moment coming. They just didn’t think it would get here so fast.“I thought this was going to be a 2021, 2022, 2023 problem,” said Quint, who formerly worked as a senior market engineering specialist at the ISO. From here, “the ramp is only going to get steeper and it’s not going to go away.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/day-california-went-dark-crisis-113000960.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-16	2020-08-16 03:17:44	SRE	Sempra	California Faces Second Night of Blackouts Amid Heat Wave	(Bloomberg) -- California endured another round of rolling blackouts after the operator of the state’s grid issued an emergency order for utilities to throttle back power to prevent a heat wave from overwhelming the system.It’s the second night in a row that the California Independent System Operator has taken the drastic step as temperatures soar across the U.S. West and people blast fans and air conditioners to keep cool. About 352,500 customers were affected, based on the estimated amount of power cut, affecting about 1 million people based on the average household size.The outages are the latest example of how climate change and the extreme weather it triggers take a profound toll on electrical grids. Just days ago, millions of people lost power in U.S. Midwest after a wall of lightning, hail and deadly winds tore a path of ruin from central Iowa to Chicago. Before that, Tropical Storm Isaias darkened homes from the Carolinas to Connecticut.For California, the problem is heat. An unrelenting high-pressure system is pushing temperatures upward, leaving the region facing what’s expected to be its hottest two weeks in 70 years. That’s driving up power demand to extreme levels, making it hard for generating plants to keep pace.Before Friday, California hadn’t imposed rolling blackouts since the energy crisis of 2001.Read More: One Million Lost Power in Storm That Spawned Chicago TornadoThe California Independent System Operator, which runs the state’s grid, had announced late Saturday afternoon that blackouts weren’t needed. Then the system unexpectedly lost generation, and it become clear it couldn’t meet demand, said Anne Gonzales, a spokeswoman for the California ISO said in an interview.The grid operator said it the emergency was declared at 6:28 p.m. local time following an unexpected loss of a 470-megawatt power plant, and 1,000 megawatt of wind power. The order ended 20 minutes later as wind resources increased, it added.The state’s largest utility, PG&E Corp., said about 220,000 customers in portions of the Central Coast and Central Valley, including Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Joaquin counties were affected. Edison International’s Southern California Edison utility said about 70,000 customers were impacted in the short-lived event.“At 6:28 p.m., we dropped load, we de-energized about 70,000 customers, then we were directed by CAISO to restore them by 6:44 p.m.,” Southern California Edison spokesman Robert Villegas said in a phone interview.Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric utility said shutoffs were “widespread” across its territory in San Diego and southern Orange counties, though customers who had their power cut on Friday night were not impacted Saturday. Power was fully restored as of 6:55 p.m., it said.On Friday, the state’s grid operator ordered blackouts after a 500-megawatt generator tripped offline unexpectedly while a 750-megawatt unit was already down. If both had been in service, grid operators wouldn’t have had to call for outages, Gonzales said.The heat and the blackouts are hitting at an especially vulnerable time, with Covid-19 forcing millions to remain at home.The last time such a declaration was made during the electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001, hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses took turns going dark, power prices surged to a record and the state’s largest utility was forced into bankruptcy.Widespread HeatRegions around the world have been grappling with extreme heat, including parts of Europe and the eastern U.S., where temperatures last month were expected to set records for New York and Boston.Last month was tied for the world’s second-hottest July on record and the hottest ever in the northern hemisphere, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But few authorities, if any, resorted to rotating outages.In addition to mass blackouts to protect the grid, a prolonged hot spell could trigger scattered outages as aging utility equipment fails in the heat. Transformers -- the metal cylinders sitting atop power poles -- can break down and even catch fire if they can’t cool off at night. During a 10-day heatwave in 2006, California utilities lost more than 1,500 of the devices, with each knocking out one neighborhood in the process.(Adds details of outages beginning in the sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-faces-second-night-blackouts-020525955.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-08-15	2020-08-15 06:28:17	SRE	Sempra	Two Million Californians Go Dark and the Heat Is Just Beginning	(Bloomberg) -- As many as two million Californians were plunged into darkness over the course of four hours late Friday in the first rolling blackouts to hit the state since the 2001 energy crisis.And that was only Day One. A relentless heat wave is expected to blanket California through the middle of next week, sending temperatures soaring past 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) in some parts. People blasting their air conditioners and fans to keep cool are straining the region’s power system and raising the specter of a repeat of Friday’s sudden and largely unannounced outages.It started at about 6:30 p.m. local time on Friday, when California’s grid operator determined through a complex calculation that the state’s power reserves had fallen below a critical threshold and called a Stage 3 grid emergency, which triggers what it describes as “load interruption.” The last time such a declaration was made during the 2000 and 2001 electricity crisis, hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses took turns being plunged into darkness, power prices surged to a record and the state’s largest utility was forced into bankruptcy.“We had an energy shortfall,” Anne Gonzales, a spokeswoman for grid manager California Independent System Operator, said in a phone interview late Friday. The agency put the call out to the state’s utilities to cut demand by about 1,000 megawatts. That’s enough to power about 750,000 homes, by California ISO’s estimates, affecting well over 2 million people based on the average household size.The heat and the blackouts are hitting at an especially vulnerable time for the region with the pandemic forcing people to remain at home. They’re also coming less than a year after utilities in the region deliberately cut off power to millions of customers in an effort to prevent their power lines from igniting wildfires amid unusually strong winds -- another consequence of increasingly extreme weather brought on in part by climate change.Widespread HeatRegions around the world have been grappling with extreme heat in recent weeks. What was forecast as one of the worst heat waves in more than a century gripped parts of Europe in August. The eastern U.S. is just emerging from July temperatures that were expected to topple daily records in Manhattan and Boston dating to the 19th century. But few, if any, have had to resort to the rotating outages that California orchestrated late Friday.The bulk of the shutoffs came from PG&E Corp. The state’s biggest utility said it expected as many as 250,000 customers to be shut off in rolling outages, with power to be fully restored by 11 p.m. “Unfortunately, because of the emergency nature of this, we weren’t able to notify customers in advance,” Jeff Smith, a company spokesman, said in a telephone interview. The outages occurred for 60 to 90 minutes on a rotating basis through the utility’s Northern and Central California service territory, he said.Edison International’s Southern California Edison utility began shutting off customers shortly before 7 p.m., with about 132,000 powerless as of 7:45 p.m. “It’s happening pretty fast,” said spokesman David Song. Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric utility said shutoffs were “widespread” across its territory in San Diego and southern Orange counties.Temperatures climbed to a record in parts of the Bay Area on Friday, according to the National Weather Service, with San Francisco reaching 95 degrees Fahrenheit and San Jose at 103.California won’t see a respite from the high temperatures until later next week, based on National Weather Service forecasts. The weather agency had posted excessive heat warnings for much of California from Friday through Wednesday.Electricity prices have already hit two-year highs as weather forecasters called for extreme temperatures. Spot power prices surged past $1,000 a megawatt-hour across California on Friday evening. Natural gas prices in Southern California more than doubled on the increased need for the fuel for power production, according to report from BloombergNEF.Grid operators will continue to monitor the situation throughout the weekend and into next week, Gonzales said. The odds of rolling outages on Saturday and Sunday might prove lower as demand is typically weaker outside of work hours. Asked whether the California ISO will need to call for additional power shutoffs, she said: “We don’t expect one, but we are prepared for one.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-calls-rolling-blackouts-first-020606005.html?.tsrc=rss

The Sempra Energy Analyst: Julien Dumoulin-Smith upgraded Sempra Energy from Neutral to Buy and raised the target price from $127 to $135.The Sempra Energy Thesis: Sempra Energy is among the handful of energy utilities and infrastructure companies to reaffirm its topline guidance for 2020 and provide visibility into 2021, with potential upside at the California utilities, Dumoulin-Smith said in the upgrade note.The company may raise its earnings guidance during its second-quarter earnings call, and the current Street expectations appear too conservative, the analyst said. Sempra Energy is poised for historical earned returns on equity levels at the California jurisdictions, while the Texas load has been resilient, he said. Although new COVID-19 cases in Texas Wednesday hit a record high and the oil market has been declining, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas has shown a meaningful improvement in load after the easing of lockdown restrictions in the state, Dumoulin-Smith said.These trends further affirm underlying positive load trends, the analyst said. The analyst expects upward revisions in earnings estimates to be &quot;a clear catalyst for value oriented names&quot; like Sempra Energy.SRE Price Action: Shares of Sempra Energy were up 0.81% at $124.48 at the time of publication .Related Links:Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For June 12, 2020Recap: Sempra Energy Q1 EarningsLatest Ratings for SRE  DateFirmActionFromTo  Jun 2020B of A SecuritiesUpgradesNeutralBuy  Jun 2020UBSMaintainsBuy  May 2020JP MorganMaintainsNeutral    View More Analyst Ratings for SRE   View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from Benzinga  * 7 Reasons Why BofA Is Raising Apple's Price Target As Stock Reaches New Highs  * KeyBanc Downgrades Starbucks Amid Slower Recovery  * Why This Ayala Pharmaceuticals Analyst Is Bullish(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The Calgren facility now collects methane— a potent greenhouse gas that would otherwise escape to the atmosphere and contribute to climate change—from more than 66,000 cows at 10 area dairy farms. The additional dairies are projected to nearly double the amount of RNG produced at the facility, further reducing greenhouse gas emissions and displacing more traditional natural gas.

The group will make the acquisition in three tranches through a unit called China Huadian Engineering, the people said, asking not to be identified as the talks are private.Stoneway’s management team will remain in place and the consortium plans to use the company, incorporated in Canada, to make acquisitions across Latin America. The deal is being negotiated by a member of the family that owns Stoneway, Rogelio Nores, who is in Beijing for the talks, one of the people said.Stoneway’s bonds surged after the report, with notes due in 2027 jumping to 66 cents on the dollar from 53 cents.A representative for Stoneway declined to comment. Representatives for Huadian and its engineering unit didn’t reply to emails and several calls seeking comment.Once completed, the takeover will expand China’s reach in the region’s power sector. In Argentina it previously acquired a pair of hydroelectric dams, and Chinese State Grid Corp. just concluded a $2.2 billion acquisition from Sempra Energy, which included some of Sempra’s Chilean energy businesses.The Stoneway deal was originally planned for earlier in the year but was postponed amid political volatility after the presidential primary elections in Argentina. At the time Huadian was seeking to purchase 50% of Stoneway on its own.Stoneway, with approximately 687 megawatts of power generation capacity, operates in Argentina through its Araucaria Energy SA and SPI Energy SA units. The company has built four power plants in the past three years and is expanding capacity at one of them.To fund the projects, the company’s Stoneway Capital unit sold 10-year junk bonds in 2017, and about $588 million of those notes remain outstanding. While the bonds have a change-of-control clause that would require owners be paid off at 101 cents, that provision is unlikely to be triggered because it’s the parent company that’s changing hands, not the unit that issued the securities, two people said.Stoneway also has an outstanding loan of almost $200 million from Gramercy Funds Management LLC and Gemcorp Capital LLP. That debt does require an instant payoff in the event of the sale, allowing the funds to exit their bet, one of the people familiar said.Representatives for Gramercy and Gemcorp declined to comment.(Updates to include bond price move in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Jasmine Ng and Sydney Maki.To contact the reporter on this story: Pablo Gonzalez in Sao Paulo at pgonzalez49@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Brendan WalshFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-consortium-close-buying-argentine-151104288.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-03	2019-11-03 11:00:00	SRE	Sempra	Edison Once Again Seeks to Limit Liability From California Fires	(Bloomberg) -- Edison International once again will try to sway a California state court judge to rule that it can’t be held liable for all the damage to private property caused by a wildfire, if it isn’t allowed to pass on some costs to ratepayers.With this year’s fire season already causing havoc in communities up and down California, Edison is making a preemptive bid to limit its liability from the Woolsey Fire that tore through Malibu last year and destroyed 1,600 structures, including homes of singer Miley Cyrus, rocker Neil Young and actor Gerard Butler. Losses from the fire total $4 billion, according to a CoreLogic Inc. estimate.The hearing Tuesday in downtown Los Angeles comes a week after Edison’s Chief Executive Officer Pedro Pizarro disclosed on an earnings call with investors that county investigators have found that the Woolsey fire was caused by Southern California Edison’s equipment.The finding could leave Edison on the hook for billions of dollars in damages. California’s so-called inverse condemnation doctrine holds utilities 100% responsible for damage caused by their equipment whether or not they were negligent.The same legal principle has driven the state’s biggest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., to file for bankruptcy protection after its equipment was linked to devastating wildfires in Northern California.It’s not the first time Edison has tried to avoid liability for a fire. The utility failed to convince a judge a year ago to dismiss inverse-condemnation claims for the massive 2017 Thomas Fire that scorched parts of Santa Barbara County and Ventura County. That fire was blamed for a subsequent mudslide that destroyed part of the affluent coastal enclave of Montecito. The first trials in both the Woolsey and Thomas Fire litigation are scheduled for next year.The strict liability the utilities face under California law for damage caused by their power lines has become an existential threat to them in recent years as widespread wildfires have become the new normal in the state. It’s become an even more pressing issue after the California Public Utilities Commission refused a request from Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric to increase its rate to compensate for payouts over a 2007 wildfire.Sempra’s yearslong fight to overturn the state commission’s decision ended last month when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case.Inverse-condemnation liability is based on the idea that losses will be spread throughout society, Edison argued in the court filing. That’s something Edison can’t do on its own, the utility said.“Edison’s rates are regulated by the PUC and it lacks the power to control market price,” it said.Lawyers representing the people who lost their homes in the Woolsey Fire predictably weren’t impressed by Edison’s argument and have called it an “improper challenge to established California law and the California constitution” that has failed in all other wildfire lawsuits involving investor-owned utilities.Edison also can’t rely on the PUC’s decision in the Sempra case because each case is different, they said.“As Edison is well aware, that decision has no application outside that proceeding or those particular fires,” the plaintiffs’ lawyers said.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysEPS in 3Q was hurt by 10 cents due to wildfire-related equity issuance, and 21 cents more from wildfire operating costs. The company is applying to regulators to recover these unauthorized costs, but that may be difficult. The outages now sweeping southern California make recovery potential more difficult.&#92;-- Kit Konolige, Senior Analyst: UtilitiesFor full report click hereThe final investigation report on the causes of the Woolsey Fire hasn’t been made public yet and the company and the plaintiffs’ lawyers have only been given a redacted version. The California Forestry and Fire Protection Department and the Venture County Fire Department have fought requests to turn over the full report because it relates to an ongoing criminal investigation.Southern California Edison isn’t aware of any basis for felony liability related to the fires, Pizzaro said during the Oct. 28 earnings call.The case is Woolsey Fire Cases, JCCP 5000, California Superior Court, County of Los Angeles (Los Angeles).To contact the reporter on this story: Edvard Pettersson in Los Angeles at epettersson@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Joe Schneider, Peter BlumbergFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edison-once-again-seeks-limit-110000863.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-23	2019-10-23 20:00:42	SRE	Sempra	California Starting Another Mass Blackout to Avoid Wildfires	(Bloomberg) -- Parts of California will go dark Wednesday afternoon in a mass blackout that could eventually leave more than a million people without power. And more shutoffs could come over the weekend.PG&E Corp. will begin cutting power to 179,000 customers in 17 northern and central California counties on Wednesday afternoon in an attempt to keep its power lines from sparking wildfires amid hot, dry winds. In Southern California, Edison International is warning that it may cut service to another 308,000, and Sempra Energy is considering a shutoff in the San Diego area. In all, about 1.5 million people may be affected.The threat of widespread shutoffs is hitting just two weeks after PG&E carried out the biggest planned blackout in California history, plunging about 2 million people into darkness, knocking out traffic lights and forcing businesses to shut. The outages have ignited a debate over how far California and its utilities are willing to go to avoid catastrophic fires.PG&E’s cutoffs are scheduled to start around 2 p.m. in the Sierra Foothills, and they are expected to spread into other areas through early Thursday. The worst of the winds are forecast to slow by noon Thursday. Meanwhile, high winds could return over the weekend, and into next week, according to the National Weather Service. PG&E has warned that there’s an “elevated risk” of shutoffs in eight of of its nine geographical zones starting Sunday. It said that storm may prove even bigger and stronger. “A small shift in the track will make a big difference,” said Spencer Tangen, a weather service meteorologist in Monterey, California. “There is a pretty high threat Saturday night into Sunday and possibly Sunday night into Monday and it is looking like they could be stronger than what we are seeing with this current one.”The threat of wildfires was listed as critical across the state Wednesday with dry winds set to “ramp up considerably” with Thursday forecast to be the worse day for storms across Southern California, the weather service said.Edison didn’t say when it may decide on a shutoff Wednesday.The blackout had one entirely predictable effect: Generac Holdings Inc., which provides back-up generators and saw a spike in demand during the last California blackout, rising as much as 3.7% to a record $90.26.Other businesses were affected more negatively: Pipeline giant Kinder Morgan Inc. said it’s halting flows on a major fuel line between California and Nevada because of the cuts. The segment will restart when power returns, the Houston-based company said.The state’s largest power company has been taking more extreme measures to prevent fires since its equipment was identified as the cause of blazes that devastated California in 2017 and 2018. That saddled the utility with an estimated $30 billion in liabilities, forcing it into bankruptcy.The Camp Fire in November 2018, which killed 86 people and destroyed an entire town, was among the tragedies sparked by power lines.Once the storm is over, the utility will have to inspect and repair lines before restoring service. It has a goal of returning power to the vast majority of customers within 48 hours of the weather passing -- potentially just in time for another wind storm to hit.Early next week, winds are expected to restrengthen after a relatively mundane weekend as a new front rushes in, according to Bob Oravec, a senior branch forecaster at the U.S. Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “The threat is going to be there,” Oravec said.Meanwhile, PG&E Chief Executive Officer Bill Johnson said late Tuesday that he didn’t want to get too far ahead “when we’ve got tomorrow to think about.”The blackout threat has spurred a debate between California Governor Gavin Newsom and the utility over who should make the call on shutoffs. In a letter to Newsom last week, PG&E Chief Executive Officer Bill Johnson said California should discuss the idea of a state agency deciding when to carry out widespread outages.Late Tuesday, Newsom shot down the idea, saying transferring control of the decision-making would be a “bailout” for PG&E.The PG&E blackout that struck earlier this month drew outrage from residents and state officials who accused the utility of cutting service to more customers than necessary and failing to properly communicate its plans.(Adds Edison estimate in second paragraph and Generac shares in eighth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Robert Tuttle.To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Chediak in San Francisco at mchediak@bloomberg.net;David R.

The utility “has experienced significant damage to power lines” that have made it difficult to estimate restoration times, the company said in a statement on its website.Utilities in Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee reported another 105,000 customer cutoffs scattered throughout their service areas as storms moved east. There were 204 reports of storm damage across the central and southern U.S. through Sunday as the front passed through, said Bob Oravec, a senior branch forecaster with the U.S. Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.Large, damaging hail was reported across Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas, according to the U.S. Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Meanwhile, tornado watches stretch from Illinois to Mississippi, and severe thunderstorms are possible as far south as central Louisiana.A strong low pressure trough that pushed the thunderstorms and wind in front of it was “a very good set-up for pretty widespread heavy rain and thunderstorms,” Oravec said.&#92;--With assistance from Brian K.

About 100,000 people were displaced, police said.The fire has burned more than 7,500 acres and is about 13% contained, authorities said. A cause hasn’t been determined. It comes after California utilities cut power to more than 2 million people to avoid having live wires topple during windstorms and spark wildfires in the state’s largest-ever preemptive blackout. Power has been restored to 97% of PG&E Corp.’s affected customers.East of Los Angeles, another fire -- named Sandalwood -- in Riverside County has burned 823 acres. Further west, the Wendy blaze in Ventura County has burned 91 acres, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.For more, listen to this mini-podcast on California’s wildfire blackouts.Edison International’s Southern California Edison utility had begun to restore power to customers it had cut power, but about 14,000 homes and businesses remained in the dark as of late Friday. The company warned 110,000 were still at risk of losing service. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the Saddleridge fire broke out in Edison’s territory or that of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Both operate in the area. The Los Angeles Fire Department said it was investigating reports of sparks flying from a transformer at the time of the blaze, which began along the 210 Freeway near Yarnell Street in Sylmar.READ MORE: Governor Slams PG&E as Epic Blackout EbbsAs they battle the blaze, crews have staged firefighting equipment around the Aliso Canyon storage site, according to SoCalGas. The facility does not appear to have suffered damage, and there are no indications of leaks, the utility said in a statement at 10 a.m. local time Friday. The company said it doesn’t anticipate that any of the field’s wellheads will be damaged.The blaze also prompted authorities to partially close several freeways including parts of Interstate 5, the West Coast’s main north-south artery.In 2015, employees discovered a massive gas leak at Aliso Canyon, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate for months. Sempra has already reported more than $1 billion in costs associated with the incident.(Updates with PG&E restoration in third paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Christopher Palmeri, Naureen S.

Are a cascade of troubling headlines and fears of Wall Street volatility making you nauseous? A regular stream of cash distributions can help smooth out your returns and restore your sanity.But investors also are increasingly targeting a more direct solution to volatility: low-volatility funds. These products are designed to piece together a basket of stocks whose movements aren't as exaggerated as the rest of the market, and they're gaining in popularity. The iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV), for instance, had enjoyed nearly $6 billion in net inflows through 2019's midway point. Invesco S&P; 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV), which is roughly a third of the size of USMV, had brought in $2 billion.Fortunately, dividends and low volatility aren't an either/or proposition. You can get both, and DIVCON can help us discover these more stable dividend stocks.The DIVCON system from exchange-traded fund provider Reality Shares examines the payout health of all dividend stocks among Wall Street's 1,200 largest companies. It does that by poring into metrics including profit growth, free cash flow (how much cash companies have left over after they meet all their obligations) and even the Altman Z-score, which helps assess a company's likelihood of a bond default or bankruptcy. The resulting rating system (a 1-5 scale in which DIVCON 5 indicates the healthiest of payouts and DIVCON 1 indicates dividends at the most risk) provides a measure of a dividend's sustainability and chance of future growth.Here are seven dividend stocks for a little peace of mind. All seven stocks not only boast strong DIVCON 4 ratings, but have exhibited lower volatility and total-return outperformance (that's price plus dividends) versus the S&P; 500 over the past year.

2019-08-21	2019-08-21 11:37:38	SRE	Sempra	5 Utility Stocks to Buy for an Extra Durable Portfolio	[Editor's note: This story was published in July 2018. It has since been updated and republished.]Utility stocks were supposed to be yesterday's favorite investment. The theory regarding utility stocks was simple: Robust economic growth coupled with a full labor market was supposed to spark rising inflation.The Fed was supposed to fight rising inflation with rate hikes. Fixed income yields were supposed to rise. Utility stocks, which were long viewed as bond substitutes in an era of ultra-low interest rates, were supposed to fall.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut that theory hasn't fully materialized into reality.The result? Utility stocks haven't lost their shine. With inflation relatively contained and investors ducking into safety, stocks in utilities are still attractive assets to own for dividend yield hunters. Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund(NYSE: XLU), a utilities ETF, has jumped  13.5% in 2019.The markets' recent volatility has contributed to the XLU's gain, as investors flee toward any safe haven. Not to mention, a number of other catalysts are in play.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill Inflation isn't soaring higher because technology giants are suppressing inflationary pressures (just think about the downward pressure Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is putting on all consumer goods prices). This trend won't reverse any time soon, and thus, inflationary pressures should remain subdued for the foreseeable future. With those forces subdued, utility stocks have room to rally.With that said, what are the best utility stocks to buy for your portfolio? Here's a list of five stocks that I think are worth a look: American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Shutterstock Considered one of the industry's heavyweights, American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) is a massive electric utility company that delivers electricity to more than five million customers across eleven states.Over the past three months, AEP stock is up 4.8% and it's up a whopping 24% year to date.The business right now is doing pretty well, as robust economic strength in the company's core markets has boosted the business. Overall, sales and earnings are both trending higher at a healthy rate. Sempra Energy (SRE)Source: Shutterstock   Another one of the industry's heavyweights is Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE), the multi-faceted energy company that provides energy services to more than 40 million customers globally across Southern California, Texas, Chile and Peru. In 2019, SRE stock is up nearly 31%. Sempra's business is doing well: Both revenues and earnings are trending higher amid a favorable economic backdrop.Plus, the company is continuing its energy diversification efforts by expanding its liquid natural gas (LNG) business, something which the company feels can help fuel sustainable long-term growth.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential The dividend yield on SRE stock sits right around 2.8%. That isn't great, but it's right around where the yield has been over the past several years. Duke Energy (DUK)Source: Shutterstock Next up is electric power and gas utility giant Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). Much like the other names on this list, Duke's operations are stable and healthy. That said, DUK stock is up more than 7% year-to-date with a dividend yield of 4.15%.Business remains fine, mostly thanks to favorable weather and strengthening economic conditions. And Duke's revenues and earnings have been trending consistently higher at a slow and stable rate.This level of growth should persist for the next several years as economic conditions remain solid. American Water Works Company (AWK)Source: Shutterstock Although electricity and power are very important utilities, another utility of equal importance is water, and that is where American Water Works Company (NYSE:AWK) comes into the picture.American Water provides waters services to 15 million people across 46 states and Canada. That makes American Water the largest and most diverse publicly traded water company.Moreover, American Water is planning on spending a whole bunch of money over the next several years to modernize water distribution infrastructure, an investment that will likely lead to rate hike approvals and robust long-term earnings growth.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On AWK stock has a dividend yield of 1.62%. That isn't great. But, what the company lacks in dividend yield, it makes up for in earnings growth, which should be able to run around 10%-per-year for the next several years. It's already up nearly 40% this year. That combination of healthy earnings growth and stable yield should make AWK stock a winning investment. NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: Shutterstock Perhaps the utility stock with the most long-term earnings-growth potential on this list is NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). That is because not only does NextEra operate a massive utility business like the other utility players on this list, but the company is also a leading player in renewable energy and battery storage.Over the past decade, this company has grown earnings and dividends at an 8%-per-year clip, and that robust growth should continue so long as the company's renewable business continues to scale.The one thing to be worried about when it comes to NEE stock is that the dividend yield is at 2.4%, which is a five-year low. But earnings growth is robust, and it is large enough to compensate for a historically low dividend yield.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN and AWK.

(SoCalGas) and Electrochaea today announced the commissioning of the nation's first scalable biomethanation reactor system at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Energy System Integration Facility in Golden, Colo.  The technology uses renewable electricity to convert hydrogen into pipeline quality methane for use in homes, businesses and in transportation.  Over the next 24 months, the project will assess the commercial viability of this power-to-gas approach to energy storage and decarbonization and provide insights into potential mega-watt scale system designs.  The announcement was made in conjunction with NREL's third annual Partner Forum.  Biomethane, or renewable natural gas, is created through this bioreactor system in a two-step process.  First, renewable electricity, generated by the sun, passes through an electrolyzer where water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen, storing the renewable electricity as hydrogen gas.  The newly-created ""green"" hydrogen is combined with carbon dioxide and piped into the reactor where archaea microorganisms produce renewable natural gas by consuming hydrogen and carbon dioxide and emitting methane.  The system is capable of recycling carbon dioxide from a myriad of sources, such as ethanol plants and anaerobic digesters, preventing greenhouse gas emissions and displacing the consumption of fossil methane."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/socalgas-electrochaea-announce-commissioning-biomethanation-210000265.html?.tsrc=rss

The U.S. National Weather Service issued heat advisories for much of the Southeast.  The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), grid operator for much of the state, reported demand hit 74,531 megawatts (MW) at 5 p.m. CDT (2200 GMT) on Monday and could approach 75,000 MW on Tuesday.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-texas-power-demand-sets-215442080.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-04	2019-08-04 11:35:21	SRE	Sempra	Goldman Sachs: 5 Stocks To Buy, Even If Markets Stall	Goldman Sachs has just revealed a valuable investing strategy that’s worth keeping a close eye on in the coming months. The firm is now recommending stocks with the fastest expected return-on-equity growth (or ROE). That’s because market upside is increasingly limited from current levels, says Goldman Sachs. “We forecast flat S&P 500 margins through 2020, with risks tilted to the downside. ... Amid concerns about the growth and profitability outlook this year, investors have assigned a premium to companies able to expand ROE,” the firm’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin said. He directed investors to the firm’s basket of 50 S&P 500 stocks with the highest consensus estimates of ROE growth. This basket is already proving its worth and is currently beating the index by 5 percentage points year-to-date. In essence, ROE reflects the return a company generates on capital that is owned by the shareholders.“The basket typically outperforms in weakening growth environments as investors assign a scarcity premium to firms that are able to expand ROE despite index-level headwinds,” Kostin told investors. So with this outlook in mind, here are five stocks that feature on the firm’s ROE basket list:  1&#92;. Under Armour (UA)Athletic apparel retailer Under Armour has had a volatile time recently. Shares plunged 20% after the company reported disappointing revenue, on weaker-than-expected North American sales. Rising trade tensions haven’t helped either, although shares are still trading up 23% year-to-date.Don’t give up yet, says top Stifel Nicolaus analyst Jim Duffy. He has just reiterated his buy rating on the stock with a $30 price target (56% upside potential). He remains adamant that the bullish investing thesis ‘remains in-tact’ and advised investors to focus on UA’s ‘green pasture opportunities’ and ‘capacity for margin improvement and multi-year earnings power’. “Bears will cling to concerns over growth in North America… [but] we remain confident that Under Armour is building a healthier revenue base in North America, upon which it can grow more meaningfully in future periods, and continue to believe North America revenue can accelerate into 2020 and beyond,” Duffy wrote. Citigroup analyst Paul Lejuez also focuses on the long-term picture: “With Under Armour in the early stages of its five-year plan, choppiness quarter-to-quarter is not unexpected,” he wrote. The analyst upgraded UA from Hold to Buy back in April, stating at the time “Under Armour has grown up, with a renewed focus on driving profitability and return on invested capital.” From the Street’s top analysts, UA shows a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy analyst consensus. That’s with 3 buy ratings vs 1 hold rating and 1 sell rating. Meanwhile the average analyst price target stands at $26 (35% upside potential).  2&#92;. Apple (AAPL)iPhone maker Apple is another key stock highlighted by Goldman Sachs for its ROE potential. Investors rejoiced as Apple reported excellent 3Q:FY19 results and served up a strong outlook.  Although the iPhone portfolio continued to struggle in the quarter, Apple grew its non-iPhone revenue by 17% with notable strength in Wearables and further progress in Services. Following the quarter, five-star Monness analyst Brian White increased estimates, while raising his 12-month price target from $245 to $265 (30% upside potential). “We found the tone of the call upbeat with Apple serving up a strong outlook and voicing enthusiasm around the innovation pipeline” cheered White. He also noted that the launch of a 5G iPhone in 2020 has the potential to drive a healthy upgrade cycle. Meanwhile Daniel Ives tells investors not to panic about President Trump’s latest tariff tweets. While AAPL remains the &quot;poster child&quot; for the US/China UFC trade battle, “seeing the forest through the trees the fundamental impact on iPhone production and the potential cost increases are thus far containable in our opinion” Ives said. Best performing analysts score the stock a ‘Moderate Buy.’ In the last three months, AAPL has received 12 buy ratings and 8 hold ratings. These 20 top analysts have a $228 average analyst price target, indicating 12% upside potential for AAPL stock.  3&#92;. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Worldwide IT leader Cisco has just announced a $2.6 billion deal to buy high-speed optical components maker Acacia Communications. The acquisition should reinforce Cisco’s position as the leader in enterprise networking, enthuses five-star Robert W Baird analyst Jonathan Ruykhaver. “With the explosion of bandwidth in the multi-cloud era, optical interconnect technologies are becoming increasingly strategic” explained Cisco’s executive VP, David Goeckeler. He added: &quot;The acquisition of Acacia will allow us to build on the strength of our switching, routing and optical networking portfolio to address our customers’ most demanding requirements.”However, as Ruykhaver points out, the deal will have to go through the standard regulatory process, which includes a Chinese review. He has a buy rating on the stock and $57 price target. Even though Emerging Markets (~20% of revenue) continues to be an area of inconsistency, the analyst believes Cisco remains very well positioned. That’s as the company makes important strides towards a recurring revenue model, which today account for 30% of the company’s revenue.Like Apple, Cisco shows a Moderate Buy consensus with 12% upside potential from the $60 average price target. Twelve top analysts have published buy ratings on the stock recently, with 5 analysts staying on the sidelines.  4&#92;. Sempra Energy (SRE)Serving approximately 40 million consumers worldwide, California-based Sempra Energy focuses on electric and natural gas infrastructure. RBC Capital’s Shelby Tucker has a buy rating on Sempra with a $145 price target. He made the bullish call despite the company’s recent earnings miss, noting that Sempra maintained its guidance for full year 2019.“The main driver of the miss to our estimate comes from weaker-than-expected results at SoCalGas and the Texas utilities, partially offset by stronger performance at Sempra LNG. Despite the miss, SRE has reaffirmed its 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.70-$6.30” noted Tucker. Only a couple of analysts have published recent ratings on Sempra stock- with the consensus working out at Moderate Buy. Their average price target works out at $147 (8% upside potential).  5&#92;. Global Payments (GPN) Last but not least comes fintech giant Global Payments. The stock is buzzing right now following solid earnings results. Analysts responded with a wave of positive sentiment and price target hikes. Notably, SunTrust analyst Andrew Jeffrey raised his price target to $190.00 (from $175), while Susquehanna’s James Friedman now has a Street-high price target of $200.00 (up from $170 previously).“The quarter represents yet another beat-and-raise as Global Payments continues to deliver upside on both the top and bottom-line, and we view the updated FY19 targets as likely conservative based on our belief that there is margin upside for the [fiscal year] even beyond the upwardly revised margin outlook,” wrote Jefferies’ Trevor Williams, who rates the stock a buy with a $190 target price. “While the bar for the quarter was relatively high given the run in shares, we think that the results will be enough to sustain the momentum in the stock.” What’s more the massive $21.5 billion merger with Total System Services (TSS) is now fast-approaching. “Importantly, the TSS merger is set to close as early as the beginning of 4Q19 and preliminary work has led to mgmt. being incrementally more confident in delivering and potentially exceeding targets” commented Deutsche Bank’s Bryan Keane on July 31. Out of all the stocks highlighted by Goldman Sachs, GPN is the only stock with a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus. Indeed, 14 of 15 top analyst ratings in the last three months are a ‘buy.’ Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $180 suggests 11% upside potential lies ahead.

At the new facility, Calgren collects cow manure – a potent source of greenhouse gas emissions - from four local dairy farms and processes it in an anerobic digestor that accelerates the natural decomposition process.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/socalgas-calgren-announce-completion-dairy-203500636.html?.tsrc=rss

Sempra Energy said last week that it would commit $450 million. Edison International was the last to chime in, confirming late Thursday that it would participate and pitch in $2.4 billion.The fund was a crucial part of legislation that California lawmakers rushed to pass earlier this month as the state heads into yet another wildfire season. Without it, utilities owned by both Edison and Sempra were facing junk ratings and PG&E faced the threat of more liabilities on top of the estimated $30 billion that it’s already dealing with. PG&E’s equipment has been tied to the Camp Fire -- the deadliest blaze in state history that killed 85 people in November.Edison’s Southern California Edison said it will put an initial $2.4 billion into the fund by September 10 and make additional annual payments of $95 million for ten years, according to a statement Thursday. Edison said the initial contribution will take a bite out of its profits with the company lowering its adjusted 2019 earnings-per-share guidance range to $4.61 to $4.81 from an earlier estimate of $4.72 to $4.92.In total, the three utilities were required to provide $10.5 billion with an additional $10.5 billion coming from state bonds if they wanted an insurance fund.To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Chediak in San Francisco at mchediak@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Simon CaseyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/three-california-power-giants-sign-205407016.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-23	2019-07-23 17:26:55	SRE	Sempra	De Blasio’s ConEd Threat Is a Sign of What’s to Come	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- On reflection, New York Mayor Bill De Blasio didn’t choose the best day to spitball about a government takeover of Consolidated Edison Inc.’s grid. Hours after he made those comments on TV, some New Yorkers were emerging from long-delayed subway trains to find their neighborhoods transformed into a dystopian Venice, light on gondolas but heavy on garbage, as the city’s sewers struggled to cope with heavy rains.Recent blackouts, including during the weekend’s heatwave, have put ConEd in the mayor’s crosshairs, and things sure have escalated quickly. Raising the prospect of effective municipalization of the company’s main asset is akin to threatening a nuclear strike – and just as likely, given the not-obvious benefits of having New York’s grid run from City Hall.Perhaps more consequential, given ConEd is regulated at the state level, is the parallel displeasure of Governor Andrew Cuomo. ConEd is in the middle of one of its periodic rate-setting procedures, essentially where it makes a case to regulators to be allowed to raise bills to pay for capital spending and the return its investors earn on that. As it stands, regulators have recommended less-generous terms than the company wanted for the New York City utility, which provides the vast majority of its income. ConEd sought a financing structure of 50% equity and an allowed return on that equity of 9.75%. Regulators have instead preliminarily recommended 47.3% equity and a return of 8.3% – small tweaks, seemingly, but enough to drop the implied net income by roughly a fifth, all else equal.With those recommendations made in late May, the market has priced this in to some degree already. Where the blackouts and subsequent political ire could potentially come into play is in the negotiations this summer over where those numbers settle. It could also prompt greater scrutiny of how the utility is allocating its budget with regards to updating and replacing older equipment. Even if staff on the Public Service Commission aren’t inclined to take their cues from the latest news cycle, we all tend to take notice when our boss is mad.For investors, such considerations matter especially because ConEd’s stock trades close to the all-time high it hit a month ago. ConEd has undergone a big re-rating upward over the past five years, jumping from 12 times forward earnings to almost 20 times, overtaking the broader regulated utilities sector. That performance acts as a headwind to ConEd’s regulated return due to the formula used by the PSC in setting it (a higher multiple essentially reads as a lower rate of return demanded by investors). The bigger issue, however, is that, as with any stock, a higher multiple leaves little room for error. Greg Gordon, who covers utilities for Evercore ISI, noted in a recent report that, even assuming the allowed return comes in above the PSC’s recommendation, his model implies the company needing to issue $2.6 billion of new equity – about 9% of the current market cap – over the next two years if it wants to protect its current credit rating. In part, that is a result of ConEd’s decision to buy Sempra Energy’s California renewable-energy assets late last year – just before they got mired in the bankruptcy of PG&E Corp.The latter is also currently facing calls by politicians in one of its big urban markets, San Francisco, to take over their grid. That situation is clearly an acute crisis compared to what’s been happening in New York, and yet there are also good reasons to be wary of thinking municipalization is a silver bullet there (see this).Nonetheless, as my colleague Mark Chediak points out, several cities across the U.S. have now raised the prospect with a greater or lesser degree of seriousness. Besides politicians letting off steam, other factors may be fueling such talk. In part, it reflects the flatlining of electricity demand over the past decade or so, which has raised questions about how power is paid for and led some prominent companies to break away from their local grid, or attempt to. It is also a function of technology, as notions of what may be possible outside of the traditional regulated utility model expand. Indeed, Cuomo’s own Reforming the Energy Vision strategy for the state’s power sector reflects this. (Disclosure: My wife runs a company developing a distributed energy platform in New York.) There is also the issue of climate change and the balkanized response to it across the U.S. Patchwork policy is inevitable in America’s federal system, especially as utilities are regulated mostly by the states. This tendency is given added impetus by the current federal administration preferring to ignore the problem. Individual locales don’t necessarily have that luxury.While it takes a leap to pin this or that extreme weather event specifically on climate change, the West Coast’s wildfires and the East Coast’s heatwave and heavy rains unequivocally tell us one thing. With such events due to occur more frequently as a result of climate change, it is becoming abundantly clear that our 20th-century infrastructure isn’t built to handle it. Don’t expect the battle over how we address that, who pays and gets compensated for it, to let up.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2019-07-14	2019-07-14 12:21:08	SRE	Sempra	Barry Brings Life-Threatening Floods, Tornadoes to Louisiana	(Bloomberg) -- Barry risks causing life-threatening floods after making landfall in Louisiana on Saturday, as the tropical storm lashes the state with as much as two feet of rain. The system is forecast to weaken further on Sunday as it treks inland.The storm came ashore near Intracoastal City -- about 125 miles west of New Orleans -- in Louisiana and has top winds of 65 miles (105 kilometers) per hour, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory at 5 p.m. in New York. Up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain could fall in some areas of the state, according to the NHC.The National Hurricane Center looks for a few tornadoes to be triggered across Louisiana, Mississippi, western Alabama and eastern Arkansas as Barry slowly marches north, although flooding is the primary threat. Early Sunday, Barry was near Peason Ridge, Louisiana, moving north at about 6 miles (10 km) per hour, and that general motion is expected to prevail, carrying the storm as far as Arkansas tonight and Monday, the center said. Barry, which was earlier a Category 1 hurricane, has cut energy production in the Gulf of Mexico, helped lift oil and natural gas prices, threatened crops from cotton to sugar and disrupted ship traffic on the Mississippi.While it had threatened to raise the river’s levels in New Orleans to the most in almost seven decades, the National Weather Service now estimates a peak of about 17 feet, or almost three feet below prior forecasts. That would still be the highest since 1995.“The worst is yet to come,” said Jim Rouiller, chief meteorologist at the Energy Weather Group near Philadelphia. “This is a very different kind of storm. It will continue to consolidate and be a severe flooding event for the state of Louisiana.”Over 110,000 utility customers across Louisiana are being affected by power outages, according to data compiled from company maps.Entergy Louisiana LLC, the main provider in the state with a total of 1.08 million customers, reported that about 71,600 were affected. Almost 43,500 out of Cleco Corp.’s nearly 285,000 customers were without power.The storm is now about 20 miles southwest of the city of Lafayette. It’s expected to move generally northward through the Mississippi Valley through Sunday night.Barry will weaken to a depression by Sunday and could degenerate completely by Monday or Tuesday, the hurricane center said. Moisture from the storm will still bring rain through the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys.“Life-threatening, significant flash flooding and river flooding will become increasingly likely later today and tonight as Barry moves inland, especially across portions of south-central and southeast Louisiana and Mississippi,” Jack Beven, a senior hurricane specialist at the NHC in Miami, wrote in an earlier forecast analysis.In the last three years, 83% of storm deaths have been a result of inland flooding, Ken Graham, the NHC’s director, said in an online presentation. The moisture heading toward the Gulf coast “is off the charts,” he said.For more, listen to this mini-podcast on the stormCompanies have cut 70% of oil and about 56% of natural gas output in the Gulf. Tropical-storm-force winds are reaching as far as 175 miles out of Barry’s center, according to the NHC’s advisory.While New Orleans -- where an emergency was declared Wednesday -- hasn’t undergone a mandatory evacuation, Mayor LaToya Cantrell had urged residents to be prepared to shelter in place because the slow-moving storm could bring heavy rain for 48 hours.Also read: New Orleans Told ‘Do Not Drop Your Guard’ as Barry Brings RainsWhile the threat to levees along the Mississippi isn’t as great, many secondary rivers throughout Louisiana are going to rise rapidly and flood, said Graham at the NHC. “We’re still dealing with Barry. It isn’t a hurricane anymore but it doesn’t matter, there is going to be a ton of rain out there,” he said.The storm will likely cause about $800 million to $900 million in damage, Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research in Savannah, Georgia, said on Friday.For a map showing assets in the storm’s path, click here(Updates with storm weakening, threat of tornadoes.)&#92;--With assistance from Sheela Tobben, Michael Hirtzer, Kevin Varley, Shruti Date Singh, Will Wade, Mark Chediak, Stephen Stapczynski, Rachel Adams-Heard and Andres Guerra Luz.To contact the reporter on this story: Brian K.

Together, the terminals account for about 70% of America’s capacity to ship LNG overseas. Two gas tankers are waiting to approach Sabine Pass, while a third recently departed, according to ship tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.Another terminal, Venture Global LNG Inc.’s Calcasieu Pass in Cameron Parish, is under construction. Sabine Pass continues to operate and Cheniere doesn’t expect major impacts to operations from Barry, the company said Thursday. Gas flows to the facility via pipeline have dropped about 20% since July 9, BloombergNEF data show. Sempra said it’s monitoring the storm, while a Venture Global spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment.LNG exports from the U.S. have surged, reaching buyers from Mexico to Japan, with three new terminals starting up since December. The cargoes provide an important outlet for gas producers as supply from shale basins soars, pressuring prices lower.Sabine Pass has five tanks for storing super-chilled gas, but two have been unavailable since the beginning of last year, when plant workers discovered a crack in one of the them. Investigators later found that a second tank had also had LNG released from its inner wall.Earlier this week, U.S. regulators told Cheniere that more work is needed before the tanks can be returned to service. That means the company has less flexibility to stock up on LNG when ships can’t reach the terminal to load cargoes during bad weather.(Updates with Sabine Pass flows in third paragraph, tank repairs in fifth.)&#92;--With assistance from Ryan Collins, Naureen S.

2019-07-05	2019-07-05 20:48:31	SRE	Sempra	PG&E, Edison May Not Get California Help on Fires by July 12	(Bloomberg) -- California’s biggest utilities -- PG&E Corp., Edison International and Sempra Energy -- may not get the help they need to deal with multi-billion dollar wildfire liabilities before lawmakers adjourn July 12 for recess.Governor Gavin Newsom signaled that pending legislation may not be finalized by then, a date around which S&P Global Ratings has indicated it might downgrade the utilities to junk absent state action. “The bond-rating agencies have marked the 12th and 13th as important days,” Newsom said Wednesday at an unrelated bill signing event, according to CALmatters, a nonprofit news organization. “But if we make a tremendous amount of progress in the next two weeks and it bleeds over for a few days, I imagine that will be considered.”Asked about the comments Friday, Newsom spokesman Nathan Click said the administration was “continuing to work toward the 12th” but that it’s “also important to get it right.”California’s utility giants are counting on the legislation to save them from mounting liabilities tied to wildfires that their equipment keeps igniting. The state’s largest power company, PG&E, was forced to declare bankruptcy in January to deal with an estimated $30 billion in fire damages. Both Edison International’s and Sempra Energy’s utilities face junk ratings should the state fail to come up with a fix in time.In California, a legal doctrine known as inverse condemnation holds utilities liable for wildfires that their equipment sparks, even if they aren’t proven negligent. Newsom has proposed a sweeping plan to help power providers pay for future wildfire damages and make it easier for them to recover costs if they obtain a safety certification. The bill is scheduled for a committee hearing Monday after being postponed twice.S&P said in June that it may cut Edison’s Southern California Edison and Sempra’s San Diego Gas & Electric to below investment grade “on or about July 12” absent legislative action reducing the exposure to fire liabilities.“The downgrades would reflect the higher wildfire risks that California’s electric utilities are facing without adequate regulatory protections to effectively reduce those risks,” the company said.Legislative leaders, who like Newsom are Democrats, on Friday pointed to the work on the bill underway. “Substantial progress has been made,” said Kevin Liao, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.Senate President pro Tempore Toni Atkins said in a statement that the Senate is “unified” with the governor to finish the legislation “as quickly as possible.”“We know wildfire season is upon us and we must move quickly to resolve all of these issues,” she said. “We trust that the progress we have made is clear indication that we are taking this seriously.”(Updates with legislative comments starting in third to last paragraphs.)&#92;--With assistance from Mark Chediak.To contact the reporter on this story: Romy Varghese in San Francisco at rvarghese8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Elizabeth Campbell at ecampbell14@bloomberg.net, Michael B.

2019-06-22	2019-06-22 00:10:23	SRE	Sempra	One Thing California's Chief, PG&E Agree On Is a Wildfire Fund	(Bloomberg) -- California’s governor and bankrupt power giant PG&E Corp. agree on one thing: The state needs a fund to deal with the liabilities utilities are facing because their equipment keeps igniting catastrophic wildfires.Both Governor Gavin Newsom and PG&E are floating plans that would establish a wildfire fund for utilities to tap to pay out fire claims. But it’s Newsom’s proposal in particular that comes with a deadline fast approaching.The governor is rushing to sell his idea to California lawmakers before a July 12 recess. If he can’t, the state’s two other major utilities - Edison International’s Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric - may wind up with junk credit ratings. And with the state heading into another wildfire season, any one of them may be a power line-sparked blaze away from financial ruin. PG&E, the state’s largest power company, has already filed for Chapter 11 to deal with an estimated $30 billion in liabilities from fires its equipment ignited in 2017 and 2018.Newsom told reporters at an event in San Francisco on Friday that he has “hope and confidence” that California’s policy makers can get legislation passed in time -- that is, he said, “if they’re committed to this issue.”The governor is proposing two alternatives for a fund. One would be a $10.5 billion liquidity fund that would serve as a line of credit for utilities. The state would fund it by extending a charge on utility bills and securitizing the revenue through state-issued bonds, according to the governor’s aides. The other option is a $21 billion insurance-like fund. Utilities would kick in an additional $10.5 billion of their own money for that one, with PG&E shelling out the most because of its higher fire risk. SoCalEd and San Diego Gas & Electric would get to decide which kind of fund to form, with PG&E bound to the decision.PG&E, meanwhile, is floating the idea of a fund that would be financed with $14 billion in state bonds. The company would stick $3 billion in it, and the rest of California’s utility owners would contribute another $3 billion. That proposal is a part of a $31 billion reorganization plan that the company hopes will have it exiting bankruptcy in March, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg.$3 Billion InvestmentNewsom’s proposal comes with strings attached, including $3 billion in shareholder money that the governor wants the state’s utilities to pony up for safety measures before tapping the fund. Under his proposal, PG&E would have to spend the most. The companies would also have to earn an annual certificate by tying executive compensation to safety performance; pass a “safety culture assessment” and comply with approved fire plans, among other things.There are parts of PG&E’s and Newsom’s proposals that appear to be perfectly aligned. PG&E is proposing to emerge from bankruptcy by March, and Newsom is calling for an exit by June. He also wants the company to settle its existing wildfire claims before gaining access to the fund, and PG&E’s bankruptcy plan would create a $14 billion fund to do just that.“That, to me, says they’re talking,” said Kit Konolige, a Bloomberg Intelligence utilities analyst.But if it’s any indication of how far along PG&E is in the settlement process, the company has only reached one major settlement from the last two fire seasons -- an agreement to pay $1 billion to 14 cities, counties and other local government agencies.Newsom said Friday that he remains concerned about the credit ratings of SoCalGas and SDG&E. S&P Global Ratings has warned that they both face downgrades below investment grade should California legislators fail to act. San Diego Gas & Electric said it’s working with the governor and lawmakers to get legislation passed by July 12, and Edison said it appreciates Newsom’s “continued sense of urgency.”PG&E said it’s “looking at all options when it comes to working with the governor and legislature.” On Friday, the company’s shareholders approved a new board crafted by hedge-fund investors that will now be responsible for steering the company through the largest utility restructuring in U.S. history.As for the legislature itself, Bill Dodd -- the California senator who has taken lead on wildfire issues -- stopped short of saying whether he would back Newsom’s plan on Friday. He instead offered up in a statement, “We look forward to carefully vetting the details of his draft and engaging in a collaborative process to develop a solution.”To contact the reporters on this story: David R.

2019-06-20	2019-06-20 20:53:38	SRE	Sempra	California Governor Pitching a Wildfire Fund to Help Utilities	(Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gavin Newsom is pressing lawmakers on a wildfire fund that may be financed through bonds to help utilities pay for the catastrophic blazes their power lines keep igniting, according to people familiar with the proposal.Newsom is proposing a so-called liquidity fund that could be seeded by at least $10 billion in Department of Water Resources bonds, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. The administration may also ask utilities to contribute about $7.5 billion in equity, the people said.The bonds would be backed by a charge that utility customers have been paying since the 2000-2001 energy crisis, they said. The fund is part of a larger plan to address the mounting costs of intensifying wildfires that may be presented as soon as this week and is subject to change, the people said.Newsom has been pressing for lawmakers to act since utility giant PG&E Corp. went bankrupt in January to deal with an estimated $30 billion in wildfire liabilities -- stemming largely from the November Camp Fire that was ignited by one of its power lines. The blaze, the state’s deadliest, killed 85 people and destroyed the Northern California town of Paradise. The governor has called on the legislature to pass a bill by July 12 as ratings companies threaten to downgrade Edison International’s Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric.Nathan Click, a spokesman for the governor, declined to comment, saying details of the proposal will be released in the coming days.PG&E surged as much as 16%, the most intraday since April 12. Edison was up as much as 2.6%.As part of the larger plan, Newsom is also pressing for regulatory changes that would make it easier for utilities to recover the costs of wildfire damages from their customers. Based on the changes that have been discussed, companies may be allowed to charge ratepayers for their expenses unless they’re proven to have acted imprudently, people with direct knowledge said.Meanwhile, Edison on Thursday warned that it may need to shut service to 6,500 customers across the high desert as gusty winds, hot temperatures and dry conditions raised the risk of wildfires in its territory. PG&E similarly shut power to hundreds of homes and businesses earlier this month to keep its own lines from sparking fires.Former state assembly member Mike Gatto said Newsom has the potential to push the legislation through by mid-July. “I can’t imagine the legislature would want to break for the recess in the height of the summer wildfire season and not solve this issue,” said Gatto, who led the utility committee while in office.It’s possible a second, larger catastrophic wildfire fund that power companies could tap to pay damages to victims may be established, but utilities would have to be willing to contribute to it, they said.PG&E, Edison and Sempra have all supported the idea of a fund, but PG&E has largely blamed a state legal doctrine known as inverse condemnation for its collapse. The doctrine holds power companies liable for claims from fires sparked by their lines, even if they weren’t negligent. A California commission recommended that the doctrine be changed, but Newsom and legislative leaders have signaled that they won’t immediately take up the issue.“The governor has been signaling maybe we should expect a fund instead of changes to inverse condemnation,” said Kit Konolige, a utility analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.“The idea of having state-backed bonds has been raised as a way to deal with what are hopefully relatively rare and big exposures like the liabilities from the wildfires,” Konolige said.(Adds Edison warning of shutoffs in eighth paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Chediak in San Francisco at mchediak@bloomberg.net;Romy Varghese in San Francisco at rvarghese8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-governor-pitching-wildfire-fund-184311336.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-05-24	2019-05-24 18:02:52	SRE	Sempra	7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement	Utility stocks include companies that provide essential services -- electricity, energy and water -- to communities across the U.S. Because doing this in a country as big as the U.S. is no mean feat, most states have one or two exclusive providers. For this monopoly power, the utilities are regulated not only by the state government but also by the federal government.Their rates are set and their growth plans have to be approved by state regulators since utilities' expansion plans are generally funded by their customer bases.In return for reining in their operations, the state provides a healthy annual growth target for the utilities and also allows them to operate unregulated businesses that can sell power to customers in the open market. This gives utilities good avenues for profits above and beyond their regular business.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat investors get are rock-solid companies that have no trade war drama attached to them, only growing demand for electricity and reliable dividends to add to their capital gains.  * 10 Names That Are Screaming Stocks to Buy The seven utility stocks to trust for retirement below are all A-rated in my Portfolio Grader for momentum. That means the smart money is starting to roll in and will continue to as global growth and tech stocks lose their shine. PNM Resources Inc (PNM)PNM Resources Inc (NYSE:PNM) is an electric utility that operates in Texas and New Mexico.While this doesn't seem to be a top place to get into the power business, just remember two words: Permian Basin.The Permian is one of the hottest oil and gas regions in the U.S. today. There is a huge amount of activity going on there now and housing is going up to hold all the workers and supply them with what they need, and want.Tales of waitresses earning $15 an hour and oil workers in the six digits is already happening and the boom is just starting.That spells huge growth for PNM, since it's selling all this new power to the industry and all the businesses that are coming to the region.This explains why PNM is up more that 20% in the past 12 months, which is a pretty nice run for a utility. Its 2.4% dividend may not be spectacular, but right now, this is about the safest energy play around for long-term investors. Evergy Inc (EVRG)Evergy Inc (NYSE:EVRG) is a classic example of a solid energy company that posts reliable returns and delivers a solid dividend. It's the poster child for compounding.Having started its life as Kansas City Power & Light and serving the Kansas market for many years, in 2018 it merged with Westar Energy. Now it has 1.6 million customers in both Kansas and Missouri.This merger will help EVRG grow its base and exercise greater efficiencies that will help it squeeze more profit from its production.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains The stock is up 6% in the past year and delivers a solid 3.1% dividend, which adds up to a steady near-10% growth return annually. That's a lot better than a money market or a CD without taking on a great deal of risk. Middlesex Water (MSEX)Middlesex Water Co (NASDAQ:MSEX) is a water utility. There aren't a lot of these, but they had a run in the 1990s when the economy was weak and municipalities were finding it hard to run and maintain their water systems.After some consolidation over the years, MSEX remains a long dependable player in the sector. Basically, instead of a city or county managing water resources -- wastewater, filtration, distribution, maintenance, etc. -- they contract out the work to MSEX.It currently operates in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania and has been doing so since 1897.This is an enduring business, because, like electricity, potable water and wastewater management are crucial to operating a city or town. But it's generally overlooked by Wall Street.That's good news for us. Although a few investors have seen the opportunity here since the stock is up 40% in the past year. Its dividend comes in just shy of 1.6%.With the U.S. in a steady growth mode, that's good news for local governments and that's good news for MSEX. Exelon Corp (EXC)Exelon Corp (NYSE:EXC) is a $36 billion utilities network that operates throughout the United States supporting existing utilities as well as operating power generation, marketing and delivery businesses.Instead of having a traditional home market, EXC moves into markets where the current utility isn't able to manage its base or can't find a way to make it.For example, in Washington, D.C., Potomac Gas & Electric was having a hard time balancing its growing demand with its ability to deliver electricity efficiently. EXC took over the utility and because of its scale, could modernize and upgrade the aging utility.The company's flexibility to run or help support utilities is a unique part of EXC's strategy. And it has been working.  * Top 7 Service Sector Stocks That Will Pay You to Own Them The stock is up almost 23% in the past year and it delivers a reliable 2.9% dividend. And there are still plenty of opportunities out there. Sempra Energy (SRE)Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) is another hybrid energy company. It has utility operations in the U.S. -- San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Company -- but it also has a variety of other operations that fall more on the unregulated energy side.For example, it has natural gas pipelines in the South and Southeast. It has a division that focuses on generating renewable energy in the Midwest that it distributes around the country. It also has significant operations in Latin America, supplying infrastructure equipment and gas utilities operations.It also just signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia to provide 5 million tons of liquified natural gas (LNG) to the kingdom for the next 20 years out of the Port Arthur, Texas LNG export terminal when it's completed.Its exposure to the natural gas market, especially the export sector makes this a great choice for anyone interested in stepping into the energy patch without all the volatility that would go along with a dedicated natural gas exploration and production company.Up 28% in the past 12 months and still delivering a 2.8% dividend, this is a great long-term play on growing energy demand. Duke Energy Corp (DUK)Duke Energy Corp (NYSE:DUK) has been delivering power to the people of the Carolinas and beyond since 1900. Today, it remains a classic example of the traditional energy utility that has grown up with the region and has great relations with its state regulators.Today, DUK has operations in the Carolinas -- it started and is based in North Carolina -- as well as Florida, Indiana and Ohio. It has also developed a strong group of unregulated energy businesses that help add a little juice to earnings.While there are some legacy challenges that come along with a utility that has been around so long, they're not as challenging for DUK because it has such a long history with regulators. Plus, its former longtime CEO Jim Rogers was very far-sighted when it came to investing in renewable energy and a decentralized grid.  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy And remember, the Research Triangle in North Carolina is the Silicon Valley of the East, so there's plenty of growth in its backyard. Up 17% in the past year and delivering a 4.1% dividend, this is a blue chip utility. Southwest Gas Holdings (SWX)Southwest Gas Holdings Inc (NYSE:SWX) represents a pure play on the natural gas sector.Coal was the traditional fuel for most utilities' power plants but as natural gas supply has grown in the U.S. and environmental laws became stricter, cleaner burning and cheap natural gas became increasingly popular.Now, natural gas is the go-to fuel for most utilities and large companies. SWX focuses its operations in Nevada, Arizona and California. It also has distribution channels to supply other customers around the U.S., but the lion's share of its business comes from these states.The natural gas focus is a good way to diversify these long-term picks, since each region and each piece of the grid brings on its own challenges and opportunities. The natural gas market should continue to grow for many years to come and as tensions in Asia and the Middle East grow, an accessible supply of domestic natural gas becomes a prized asset.SWX is up almost 19% in the past year and delivers a dependable 2.5% dividend.

Because Southern California Gas, a unit of Sempra Energy  , had failed to investigate and analyze leaks since the  1970s, the consequences of such corrosion were not understood,  leading to the 2015 incident, the report found.  The report was commissioned by two state regulatory  agencies, the California Public Utilities Commission and the  Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources, and conducted by  a third party, Blade Energy Partners.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/utility-failed-probe-gas-leaks-195914465.html?.tsrc=rss

The report also concluded there had been more than 60 leaks in the field dating back to the 1970s, and Sempra didn’t carry out detailed inspections after they occurred, the California Public Utilities Commission and Department of Conservation said in a joint statement.  The company’s Southern California Gas lacked “any form of risk assessment” to manage the integrity of its wells and hadn’t established systematic practices to protect against corrosion and monitor well pressure, the agencies said.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corrosion-led-worst-u-gas-201920494.html?.tsrc=rss

The SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF  shed 1.0% in afternoon trade, with 27 of 28 equity components losing ground. The biggest decliner was NRG Energy Inc.&apos;s stock  which slumped 5.1%. Among other more active utilities ETF components, shares of AES Corp.  lost 2.3%, Excelon Corp.  gave up 0.9% and Southern Co.  shed 0.6%. The lone gainer was Sempra Energy&apos;s stock  which tacked on 0.6%. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 3.6 basis points to 2.484%, after falling 10.4 basis points the previous three sessions, as a bounce in the stock market helped calm risk-off trades. Utilities stocks tend to have relatively high dividend yields, so a rise in yields on low-risk Treasurys make them less attractive.

2019-02-27	2019-02-27 12:25:30	SRE	Sempra	3 Big Stock Charts for Wednesday: Cabot Oil & Gas, Incyte and Sempra Energy	Much like Monday, on Tuesday, traders weren't quite sure which direction they wanted to go. And, when all was said and done, they didn't really go anywhere. The S&P 500 ended yesterday's action 0.07% lower than Monday's close, and more or less in the middle of the day's high/low range.That doesn't mean there weren't big movers though. Holding the market back in a big way was Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Shares of the home improvement retailer fell nearly 1% in response to a fourth quarter earnings miss and lackluster profit outlook for 2019.At the other end of the spectrum, China's upscale electric carmaker Nio (NYSE:NIO) rallied 8.6% following Monday's 60 Minutes interview with CEO William Li. For some investors, it was the first they'd ever heard of the company, driving a sudden wave of interest. Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) fared even better though, up 16.3% following a fourth-quarter earnings and revenue beat. There was just more bearish volume than bullish volume on Tuesday, and more advancers than decliners.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs Wednesday's action gets going, it's the stock charts of Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG), Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) and Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) that offer the most trading potential. Here's why, and what to look for. Sempra Energy (SRE)At first glance Sempra Energy is little more than a volatile mess. But, a closer inspection reveals there's actually a relatively organized effort underway.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market One more good shove and months worth of consolidation could readily turn into a nice breakout thrust.  Click to Enlarge • Though apparent on the daily chart, it's better appreciated on the weekly chart that SRE shares are being ushered higher by a set of parallel support and resistance lines, plotted in blue. Sempra shares just pushed off the lower edge of the range near the end of last year.• In the meantime, clear resistance has formed around $120, plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts.• While we've seen bullish thrusts fail before, this one is different. This time, the pullback seen earlier this month was halted and reversed at a convergence of several key moving average lines. It's a sign that the bulls have finally drawn a line in the sand. Cabot Oil & Gas (COG)If Cabot Oil & Gas rings a bell, there's a reason. It was one of the stock charts featured back on Feb. 20, after several weeks' worth of volatility finally began to make discernible progress. While more up and down was in the cards, the undertow had turned bullish.COG shares promptly pulled back the very next day, calling the thesis into question. But since then, the uptrend has been rekindled after COG found support right where it needed to.  Click to Enlarge • Last week's pullback stopped at the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white, and was firmly reversed.• While still volatile, notice the 200-day moving average as well as the gray 100-day moving average line are both sloped upward now, confirming the overall trend is bullish.• Zooming out to the weekly chart we can see the slow, U-shaped reversal that has been taking shape since the middle of last year, aided by a long-standing support line.• Though the tide is bullish here, Cabot Oil & Gas still faces minor resistance at $25.20 and major resistance right around $26. Incyte (INCY)Finally, Incyte has been featured several times since the middle of last year as a breakout candidate. It didn't happen in earnest until January though, and it ultimately took a bearish headfake to set the move up. And even then, there was doubt.The breakout thrust has really firmed up over the course of the past month, however, and is worth a refreshed look. While some profit-taking is likely to be in the cards, the recent gain has developed enough cushion to make a small setback not only palatable, but productive.  Click to Enlarge • The big line in the sand was at $74.90, plotted in red on both stock charts. Shares punched through that ceiling in early January, and have put some distance between them and it in the meantime.• While the divergence sends a statement, it's also clear that even just the move since early January has brought INCY to the brink of being overbought. A dip that burns off that froth would actually be bullish, in the bigger picture.• Any pullback would ideally (and probably would be) stopped and reversed either the purple 50-day moving average line or the gray 100-day average.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(SoCalGas) today announced the company has joined the Hydrogen Council, a global initiative of leading energy, transport and industry companies with a united vision to foster the role of hydrogen technologies in the global energy transition.  The announcement was made during the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco where SoCalGas representatives participated in the Council's annual meeting.  The prime focus of the meeting was discussion and planning geared towards delivering on the Council's vision of utilizing hydrogen to avert 6 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 emissions, create a $2.5 trillion market and provide employment for more than 30 million people worldwide by mid-century.  Over the last three years, SoCalGas has commissioned numerous hydrogen-related research and development projects.  One of the company's first hydrogen projects was a partnership with the University of California, Irvine on power-to-gas (P2G) technology.  P2G converts renewable electricity from solar or wind which would otherwise go to waste into hydrogen.  This renewable hydrogen can then be blended with natural gas for use in everything from home appliances to power plants.  Additionally, this hydrogen could also be used in fuel cell vehicles or converted to methane for use in a natural gas pipeline and storage system.  Hydrogen from the P2G projects helps fuel the UC Irvine campus power plant.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/socalgas-builds-clean-energy-advancements-200000901.html?.tsrc=rss

(SoCalGas) and Food Express, Inc.

The company has an additional 35 trucks on order.  Funding was received from the Prop 1B program administered by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District and the California Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Program (HVIP).  The purchase of 46 new trucks represents about 50 percent of FXI's California fleet.  The company is on the wait list for an additional $900,000 in Prop 1B grants from the San Diego Air Pollution Control District, which would be used to purchase another 9 trucks.  Replacing 55 diesel trucks with new ultra-low emission natural gas trucks is the equivalent of taking more than 3,100 passenger cars off the road.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ultra-low-emission-heavy-duty-180000281.html?.tsrc=rss

Range anxiety– the concern that your car battery will run out of power before reaching your destination or an available charging station – is a leading barrier to more people being able to switch to clean transportation, which is critical to meeting local and state climate action goals.  Yesterday, SDG&E submitted an application to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for approval to implement two pilot programs to make EV charging stations more readily available.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sdg-e-seeks-install-more-203000738.html?.tsrc=rss

(SoCalGas) today introduced an innovative new solar-powered hydrogen generation system during the California Air Resources Board Technology Expo and Symposium at the University of California, Riverside.  The project is a partnership between SoCalGas, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and the STARS Corporation.  The generation system uses sunlight to convert natural gas and water into hydrogen and capture the carbon dioxide (CO2) to prevent carbon emissions.  Hydrogen has many applications, including powering vehicles and homes, but unlike methane, it is not typically found on its own in nature so researchers have developed ways to produce it from other compounds.  SoCalGas supports efforts to increase hydrogen production, particularly for use along ""California's Hydrogen Highway,"" a series of hydrogen-fueling stations throughout the state.  Currently there are 35 hydrogen fueling stations in the state, with another 29 stations in development.  Increasing this fueling infrastructure could help speed the deployment of zero emission hydrogen fuel cell vehicles which play a significant role in reducing California's greenhouse gas and smog emissions, according to the California Air Resources Board."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/socalgas-introduces-innovative-solar-hydrogen-173000588.html?.tsrc=rss
