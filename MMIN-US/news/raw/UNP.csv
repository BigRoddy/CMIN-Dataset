2021-03-24	2021-03-24 14:10:00	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Savage and Union Pacific Collaborating to Build and Operate Idahoâs First Intermodal Rail Terminal in Pocatello	Terminalâs rail access improves export economics for Idaho producers and shippers Union Pacific's Pocatello, ID rail yard where Savage will build and operate the Savage Railport â Southern Idaho, the state's first intermodal rail terminal. POCATELLO, Idaho, March 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Savage will immediately begin construction of Idahoâs first intermodal rail terminal in Pocatello, ID. The Savage Railport â Southern Idaho will benefit Idaho farmers and families by improving the economics of exporting containerized hay and other agricultural commodities, providing faster access to Asia and other world markets. Savage has entered into an agreement with Union Pacific Railroad to construct and operate the terminal at Union Pacificâs rail yard in Pocatello, ID. The terminal is expected to be operational by mid-year 2021. âIdaho's agricultural and business communities need dependable transportation to get product into global markets,â said Idaho Governor Brad Little. âTransportation infrastructure projects like this rail terminal in Pocatello can create opportunities for Idaho businesses to grow and can help âsupport export prospects for more agriculture producers.â âWeâre excited to serve Idaho producers and shippers with intermodal export service,â said Kirk Aubry, Savage President and CEO. âThe ability to ship containers out of Idaho directly to the Pacific Northwest by rail will open up supply chains and allow more Idaho businesses to access global markets.â Savage teams will place loaded containers onto railcars at the Pocatello terminal that will be transported by Union Pacific to the Northwest Seaport Alliance ports in Tacoma and Seattle, Washington. Utilizing a direct rail connection will be more efficient, cost-effective and environmentally friendly than trucking products across multiple states. âThis new business is uniquely focused on Idaho shippersâ needs and the global economic impact Pacific Northwest exports have around the world,â said Kari Kirchhoefer, Union Pacific Vice President â Marketing and Sales Premium. âUnion Pacificâs unique collaboration with Savage uses intermodal containers heading to the Northwest ports. This partnership makes the most of the containerâs round trip and saves truck drayage costs for Idaho shippers by providing a direct rail option.â âWeâre excited that Savage chose Pocatello for their intermodal facility,â said Mayor Brian Blad. âWith the new facility, goods from businesses across Idaho will have an easier time getting to markets overseas.â âAs one of the top agricultural export gateways in North America, the Northwest Seaport Alliance congratulates Savage, Union Pacific Railroad, the city of Pocatello and the State of Idaho for partnering on this innovative project to support U.S. farmers and agricultural exports,â said Commissioner Dick Marzano, Northwest Seaport Alliance Co-Chair. âThe new service will help lower export costs and increase volumes through our gateway. The Northwest Seaport Alliance looks forward to the successful launch of this new initiative.â For business opportunities at the railport, please contact Brig Skoy, Savage Director of Business Development, at brigskoy@savageservices.com or 801-944-6535.

2021-03-22	2021-03-22 21:33:38	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	3 Railroad Stocks To Watch Amid Canadian Pacific And Kansas City Southern Merger	Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (NYSE: CP) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU) announced on Sunday they would merge in a deal valued at about $29 billion in cash and shares. What Happened: The new company, Canadian Pacific Kansas City, will create a Canada-Mexico-U.S. railroad with a combined 20,000 miles of rail. Canadian Pacific Kansas City will be a larger competitor to other rail service providers and will ease supply chain difficulties between the three member countries of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). It will also provide the companiesâ customers with an eco-friendlier alternative to truck transportation, according to Canadian Pacific's press release. Why It Matters: The Canadian Pacific Kansas City rail service will have three main competitors to keep on watch: Canadian National Railways (NYSE: CNI), headquartered in Montreal, Quebec operates 20,000 miles of rail across Canada, the Midwest and the Southern United States and through Mexico. Canadian National has a market cap of $80.89 billion and was trading down 2.25% at $113.90 at last check. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UCP), headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, boasts 32,340 miles of route track across the Midwest, West and Southwestern United States. Union Pacific has a market cap of $139.37 billion and was trading down 1.87% at $206.86 at last check. Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE: NSC), headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia, operates 19,500 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia. Norfolk Southern has a market cap of $66.24 billion and was trading up 0.96% at $262.96 at last check.

2021-02-02	2021-02-02 15:29:33	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Analyzing Union Pacific's Unusual Options Activity	"Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) shares experienced unusual options activity on Tuesday. The stock price moved up to $204.17 following the option alert. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-03-19 Strike Price: $165.00 Volume: 25 Open Interest: 39 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. ""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-01-22	2021-01-22 08:38:08	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Union Pacific Slips 5% On Weak 4Q Freight Revenues	"Shares of Union Pacific Corporation fell 4.7% on Thursday after the freight-hauling railroad company posted a decline in 4Q revenues due to lower freight revenues. Nevertheless, its 4Q revenues and earnings topped the Street's estimates. Union Pacificâs (UNP) 4Q earnings of $2.36 per share jumped 16.8% year-over-year and beat analystsâ expectations of $2.22 per share. Its revenues of $5.14 billion exceeded the consensus estimates of $5.08 billion but declined 1% year-over-year. The companyâs freight revenues took a hit, reflecting unfavorable business mix and lower fuel surcharge revenues. However, volume growth and an increase in core pricing supported the freight revenues in 4Q. Notably, a 7% decline in the Industrial category more than offset the growth in Bulk and Premium categories. (See UNP stock analysis on TipRanks) Union Pacific reported an operating ratio of 55.6%, which improved by 410 basis points year-over-year due to the lower fuel prices. As for 2021, the company's CEO Lance Fritz said, ""We expect our enhanced service product will support both solid core pricing gains while also increasing our share of the freight transportation market."" Earlier on Jan. 15, Raymond James analyst Patrick Brown raised the stockâs price target to $250 (20.3% upside potential) from $220 and maintained a Buy rating. In a note to investors, the analyst said that he remains âenamoredâ with the companyâs faster-than-anticipated implementation of Precision Scheduled Railroading. He believes that the changes in the network will yield profits. Meanwhile, the analyst consensus of a Moderate Buy is based on 12 Buys and 6 Holds. The average analyst price target of $223.59 implies upside potential of about 7.6% to current levels. Shares gained 14.6% in the last year.

2021-01-21	2021-01-21 12:13:26	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	What Does Union Pacific's Debt Look Like?	Shares of Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) increased by 20.57% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Union Pacific has.Union Pacific's Debt According to the Union Pacific's most recent balance sheet as reported on October 22, 2020, total debt is at $28.06 billion, with $26.08 billion in long-term debt and $1.98 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $2.60 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $25.46 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Union Pacific has $63.71 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.44. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-01-20	2021-01-20 15:17:12	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Earnings Preview for Union Pacific	"Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) announces its next round of earnings this Thursday, January 21. Here is Benzinga's look at Union Pacific's Q4 earnings report.What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.Earnings And Revenue Union Pacific EPS is expected to be around $2.23, according to sell-side analysts. Sales will likely be near $5.09 billion. In the same quarter last year, Union Pacific reported EPS of $2.02 on revenue of $5.21 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin.View more earnings on UNPThe analyst consensus estimate would represent a 10.4% increase in the company's EPS figure. Sales would be down 2.34% from the same quarter last year. Union Pacific's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this:Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020  EPS Estimate 2.05 1.52 1.90 2.06  EPS Actual 2.01 1.67 2.15 2.02  Revenue Estimate 4.96 B 4.37 B 5.08 B 5.27 B  Revenue Actual 4.92 B 4.24 B 5.23 B 5.21 B  Stock Performance Shares of Union Pacific were trading at $215.22 as of January 19. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 15.82%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably happy going into this earnings release.Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call.

2021-01-08	2021-01-08 21:11:48	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Court Sides With Union Pacific, Thwarting Potential Strikes	"Union members affiliated with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way â Employes Division (BMWED) can't strike against Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) over their concerns about how Union Pacific (UP) has handled the COVID-19 pandemic among its workforce.In a Thursday decision by Judge Brian C. Buescher of the U.S. District Court in Nebraska, Buescher sided with UP's request asking for a preliminary injunction that would prevent BMWED from taking actions that would disrupt operations, such as picketing or taking part in strikes or a sickout.Â The union, which is affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, had argued that its right to strike fell under the Federal Railroad Safety Act.Â But UP countered that the union can't take disruptive actions because of the Railway Labor Act (RLA).Â The judge sided with UP, and he said that the Federal Railroad Safety Act also supports UP's argument.""Union Pacific's COVID-19 response itself does not constitute a âhazardous safety or security condition' as BMWED argues. While BMWED takes issue with certain aspects of Union Pacific's COVID-19 protocol, it does not dispute that Union Pacific has, in fact, implemented numerous safety measures, including some requested by BMWED,"" Buescher said in his decision.Â ""Furthermore, witnesses testified that Union Pacific has continued to improve its response to the pandemic, including securing higher-quality masks, locating hand sanitizer when it was in short supply, and updating social-distancing requirements as CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance has evolved. BMWED seeks additional safety precautions that are either of marginal benefit because of the measures already in place or, as in the case of on-site COVID-19 testing, unworkable. Furthermore, as set forth above, BMWED's primary demands are related to pay and leave time, not measures relating to safety and health,"" he said.Buescher later continued, ""the purpose of the RLA and of the requested injunctive relief is to protect the status quo while CBA [collective bargaining agreement] negotiations are ongoing. The risk of harm to Union Pacific in allowing an unlawful strike outweighs the harm to BMWED in not allowing it to pursue self-help in order to gain the additional COVID-19 accommodations it seeks.""He said, ""Lastly, the Court concludes that the public interest favors issuance of a preliminary injunction as well. As previously stated, the threatened strike could have severe repercussions for numerous individuals and industries which rely on railroad transportation. Thus, the public interest favors maintaining the status quo and avoiding major disruption to the nation's rail lines.""The decision will remain in effect as long as the case is pending unless otherwise directed by the court.Â In response to the court decision, BMWED National Vice President Jed Dodd issued the following statement:""We are very disappointed with Judge Buescher's decision and believe that it will lead to more COVID-19 infections and death in our membership on the Union Pacific Railroad. It is infuriating that as essential workers required to go to work he found that COVID-19 was not life threatening. We have four dead members on Union Pacific Railroad and nearly 1,000 infected who would disagree. Union Pacific would rather protect their obscene profits instead of taking all reasonable measures to protect us from this terrible disease on the job and they have themselves a Judge who values their profits over our health and safety.Dodd continued, ""We have not decided on our future legal options but our struggle for decent and safe conditions on the Union Pacific Railroad is not over until Union Pacific does everything possible to protect our members from this terrible disease while they require us to go to work.""Â Meanwhile, UP issued this statement in response to the court decision:""Union Pacific is pleased with the court's decision to issue a preliminary injunction that will prevent the Brotherhood of Maintenance Way Employes Division/IBT (BMWED) from striking. This order will allow Union Pacific to continue to meet the country's freight demands, while we work with the BMWED towards our common commitment to ensure the safety of our employees,"" UP said.Subscribe to FreightWaves' e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related articles:Court action prevents union from striking against Union PacificRail union mulls action against Union Pacific over COVID-19 woesUnion Pacific expects Q4 OR in mid-50s, details Brazos yard plansSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Airlines Reinstate Collection Of Federal Excise Tax For Air Cargo  * Union Pacific Expects Q4 OR In Mid-50s, Details Brazos Yard Plans(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

2021-01-08	2021-01-08 21:06:08	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Union Pacific Expects Q4 OR In Mid-50s, Details Brazos Yard Plans	"Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) expects an adjusted operating ratio (OR) of 55.6% for the fourth quarter of 2020, the company said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.The preliminary figure comes as the company factors into its calculations a noncash impairment charge of approximately $278 million related to its investments in its Brazos yard in Texas. Prior to the changes, Union Pacific calculated an OR of 61%.Â OR, which is a company's operating expenses as a percentage of its revenue, is a metric sometimes used to describe the profitability of a company, with a lower OR implying improved financial health. UP says the OR of 55.6% is a 4.1 point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2019.UP has decided that instead of proceeding with its plans to make the Brazos yard a major classification yard, it will use the investments it has already made on the property for freight car block swapping activities.Â UP said in May 2019 that it was adding block swapping capability at its Santa Teresa intermodal complex in New Mexico.""While the company's long-term growth outlook in the southern region of its network remains unchanged, the implementation of Unified Plan 2020 has created capacity at existing facilities to effectively handle that growth,"" UP said in the filing signed by CFO Jennifer Hamann.In addition to describing its plans for the Brazos yard and announcing a tentative fourth-quarter OR, UP also gave other preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter. UP expects operating revenues of approximately $5.1 billion, operating expenses of $3.1 billion and an operating income of approximately $2 billion. Excluding the $278 million noncash impairment charge, adjusted operating expenses would be $2.9 billion.UP will release its fourth-quarter financial results on Jan. 21.In response to UP's announcement, Deutsche Bank maintained its buy rating for the company.""The bottom line is this is exactly the release UNP needed to recover for the relatively lackluster performance of 3Q (and Jim Vena's transition announcement),"" the Friday note said. ""To be sure, much of this reflects the power of recovering revenue and mix, as we highlighted in our positive 4Q preview in [mid-December] ... where we specifically called out higher grain and beer volumes as contributors to a likely better-than-expected 4Q. But the more consequential point, in our view, is that UNP is achieving a sub-55% OR in the first inning of a volume recovery, when mix is still challenging, albeit recovering.""UP had initially planned to spend $550 million on the Brazos yard to turn it into one of its highest capacity classification yards on its network, with the ability to switch up to 1,300 railcars per day. But UP's implementation of precision scheduled railroading, an operating model that seeks to streamline operations, may have contributed to UP's decision to slow down the pace of the project. UP expected to spend around $550 million on the facility, and construction was expected to be completed in 2020.Subscribe to FreightWaves' e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related articles:Construction pace slows down at Union Pacific's Brazos classification yardUnion Pacific eyes Upper Midwest for intermodal opportunitiesUnion Pacific seeks to sweat its assetsCourt action prevents union from striking against Union PacificSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Rail Roundup: Lineage, Patriot Make Acquisitions; CP, CN Set Records(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

2020-12-24	2020-12-24 17:58:15	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Court Action Prevents Union From Striking Against Union Pacific	"A U.S. federal court has temporarily restricted union members from striking against Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) over concerns about the railroad's response to the COVID-19 pandemic among a category of workers.The U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska Wednesday sided with Union Pacific's (UP) petition to prevent members of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division (BMWED) from striking against UP. The union had warned last week that it could take action against UP on allegations that the railroad hasn't done enough to protect workers against the COVID-19 pandemic.The court order restricts BMWED, which is affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, from striking or taking disruptive actions until January 8, 2021. A hearing on UP's request for a preliminary injunction will be held January 5 on whether to extend that restriction. A preliminary injunction enables the status quo to be preserved until a final judgment is reached.The union had said previously that it would take action if UP didn't respond to safety demands by this Sunday. It alleged that hundreds of UP employees contracted COVID-19 at work, with two members dying from the virus. BMWED is asking for full quarantine pay and ""common sense COVID-19 safeguards on the job"" such as access to testing on the job site, temperature taking and contact tracing.But the court said BMWED's proposal to take action or strike isn't allowable under the Railway Labor Act and the Federal Railroad Safety Act (FRSA). The court also said that UP has implemented safety guidelines related to COVID-19.""Even if the FRSA were to apply to threatened labor stoppages like the one at hand, the Court does not find the statutory requirements would be satisfied,"" U.S. District Court Judge Brian C. Buescher said in his ruling. .""First, the COVID-19 pandemic does not present a âhazardous safety or security condition related to the performance of the employee's duties,'""Â ""The pandemic is not a work-specific safety concern for the BMWED employees under the FRSA. Instead, the pandemic is, unfortunately, a worldwide and widespread problem confronting not just the BMWED employees, but individuals of all walks of life. Thus, it does not constitute a condition ""related to the performance of the employee's duties"" for purposes of the FRSA,"" the decision added.Â Subscribe to FreightWaves' e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related articles:Rail union mulls action against Union Pacific over COVID-19 woesClass I railroads grapple with COVID-19 as unions seek safety assurancesFreight interests, pilots press for priority vaccinationsLabor union presses railroads on additional coronavirus measuresCOVID-19 vaccine distribution could start in mid-December, official saysSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Rail Union Mulls Action Against Union Pacific Over COVID-19 Woes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-12-22	2020-12-22 20:22:49	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Rail Union Mulls Action Against Union Pacific Over COVID-19 Woes	"The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division (BMWED) is threatening to take action against Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP), saying that the railroad hasn't done enough to protect workers against the COVID-19 pandemic.The union, which is affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said it would take action if Union Pacific (UP) didn't respond to safety demands by Sunday.Â ""Hundreds of Union Pacific employees have contracted COVID-19 at work,"" with two members dying and ""dozens"" hospitalized, BMWED said on Friday. UP employed 32,000 workers total in mid-November, according to data submitted to the Surface Transportation Board, including over 8,000 maintenance of way employees. The union is asking for full quarantine pay and ""common sense COVID-19 safeguards on the job.""""Our union leadership has urged UP management to do more to ensure our safety since the start of the Pandemic. Management is clearly more interested in grinding profits out of us for the shareholders than investing in our safety. Management's greed in this moment WILL NOT STAND,"" BMWED said.Â ""Federal law protects our right to withdraw from service if dangerous workplace conditions present an âimminent danger of death or serious injury,'"" the union continued.In a Thursday letter to UP President and CEO Lance Fritz, BMWED outlined several measures that the union would like UP to adopt. They include:  * Continuation of pay, which would encourage employees to be tested for contracting the coronavirus since they would not feel compelled to go to work because of fear of losing their earnings.  * Access to testing on the job site and on company time.  * Temperature testing prior to work shifts.  * Contact tracing following an exposure at work.  * Daily access to personal protective equipment such as face masks and hand cleaners, as well as adequate sanitation supplies in group areas and for machines and locomotives.  * Social distancing requirements in public-use areas.Union Pacifc's responseAlthough the union didn't specifically say on Friday that it would strike, UP said Monday that it has filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska to stop BMWED from striking.""Union Pacific had no choice but to take this threat seriously, and we were forced to seek court intervention to prevent the BMWED from acting on its threats. We have worked hard to ensure the safety of our employees, while continuing to move the goods and products that our country needs to support current freight demands and recover from the pandemic,"" UP said.The railroad continued, ""We implemented a robust pandemic response to ensure that our employees remain safe and are compensated if required to be off of work because of a work-related exposure to the virus. We are unwilling to allow BMWED to unilaterally shut down Union Pacific's 23-state operations â which are critical to the recovery of the American economy â based on concerns that have been, and will continue to be, addressed.""UP has said previously that it provided union-affiliated ""agreement employees"" who have worked at least 30 days during the pandemic a one-time $1,000 gross bonus in December. The bonus applied to all current agreement employees, including those who have been furloughed, who have worked at least 30 days between March 1 and Nov. 30.BMWED responded to UP's comments by saying that UP's COVID-19 protocols are ""inadequate,"" especially since the nature of the work of maintenance-of-way employees requires workers to be in close proximity with others. As a result, the union argues that continuing to work under those protocols creates an imminent threat of serious injury or death as defined under the Federal Railroad Safety Act.Subscribe to FreightWaves' e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related articles:Class I railroads grapple with COVID-19 as unions seek safety assurancesFreight interests, pilots press for priority vaccinationsLabor union presses railroads on additional coronavirus measuresCOVID-19 vaccine distribution could start in mid-December, official saysSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Amazon Opening Three San Antonio Facilities  * Daily Infographic: Flights Take Off 2H2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-25	2020-11-25 15:08:37	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Class I Railroads Grapple With COVID-19 As Unions Seek Safety Assurances	"With coronavirus cases rising sharply in the U.S. and Canada in recent weeks, the Class I railroads have also been grappling with managing increased COVID-19 exposure on their networks.Meanwhile, some rail union members contend that the railroads have been inconsistent with how safety precautions have been applied throughout the rail network (see below).A CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) executive recently said his company has been seeing a lot of cases within the U.S. rail network, particularly in the Midwest.Indeed, in the past seven days, coronavirus cases have shot up in the Upper Midwest, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For instance, the CDC determined that there have been 9,656 cases per 100,000 residents in North Dakota over the past seven days. In contrast, New York City, an early COVID-19 hotbed, has seen about 3,598 cases per 100,000 residents.""We've seen some hot spots of employees that are having to go out because they've got the disease. And so we're dealing with it,"" said Mark Wallace, CSX executive vice president of sales and marketing, at the Baird investor conference on Nov. 12.Wallace continued, ""The most important thing that we've learned, and my sales and marketing team has done a remarkable job and a great job of, is really communicating with customers and keeping everybody abreast of what's going on, the challenges that we've experienced, what we're doing, the action plans that we're putting in place to monitor and to recover and to get their service back up and going. So we're all learning from this.""CSX told FreightWaves it has implemented safety protocols that align with CDC guidelines. But with case numbers climbing in many states and localities, CSX ""has taken swift action to enhance vigilance and to best ensure we keep our employees safe and protect our operations,"" the railroad said.Those safeguards include ""rigorous"" sanitation practices and a mandatory face-covering requirement whenever employees are in common areas or within 6 feet of another person. Other safeguards include restricting visitor access and isolating employees who have tested positive for the coronavirus or who have been in contact with a confirmed case.""We maintain ongoing communication with our customers to keep them informed and to be able to quickly address any service- or pandemic-related issues that may impact changes to their operations. In addition to the measures aimed at protecting employee health and safety, CSX has taken steps to ensure we are adequately staffed throughout the pandemic,"" CSX said.Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) has adopted safety protocols similar to CSX, such as required facial coverings in public work areas, social distancing and increased access to hand sanitizer. The railroad also said employees are using disinfecting wipes to frequently wipe down work surfaces. Locomotive cabs have also been supplied with disinfectant spray and cloths so that train crews can wipe down throttles, arm rests and other surfaces, Union Pacific (UP) said.UP said its rail network is currently fluid and service hasn't been impacted as a result of COVID-19.""We continue to ask employees to stay home if they experience symptoms consistent with COVID-19,"" UP said. ""Union Pacific's health and medical team works with employees diagnosed with the virus, conducts contact tracing to identify employees who may have been exposed and guides them during the quarantine process. We also have procedures in place to decontaminate work areas when someone tests positive.""BNSF (NYSE: BRK) told FreightWaves that its two main objectives throughout the pandemic have been to protect the health of employees and to keep trains running. The railroad said it has been grounding operational decisions in CDC guidance and making adjustments as needed.""Some of the actions we have taken over time ensure that we are better prepared and able to move quickly when conditions change. As we look to the future, the lessons of resilience and perseverance we learned will stay with us,"" BNSF said. ""As the economy has started to recover and volumes return, we will remain focused on deliveringÂ  strong service performance across our network so we are well positioned to handle our customers' freight. We have, and continue to, work with customers to identify and closely monitor critical shipments and take action to ensure that they make it to their destination on time.""Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU) echoed those sentiments, saying its two primary objectives are to protect the health and well-being of employees and ensure the continuity of essential business operations.Â The railroad said it has seen the number of COVID-19 cases rise at KCS in the U.S. and Mexico, but despite that, ""it has not impacted our ability to provide crews for essential train operations.""KCS has aggressively implemented important health and safety measures, like required maskÂ wearing, social distancing, handwashing, medical management, intensified cleaning of equipment and facilities, etc. All of these efforts combined are helping KCS keep people healthy, while maintaining essential operations for our customers and the larger economy,"" KCS said.Railroads inconsistent in COVID-19 responses: BMWEDAlthough the railroads have been stocking employees with sanitation equipment, rail workers see several problems with how the railroads have responded to the pandemic, according to Jed Dodd, vice president of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division (BMWED). BMWED is affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.One concern is that the railroads have been inconsistent with how they deploy CDC's safety protocols. Dodd argues that while some industries and individual companies such as Amazon have required employees to undergo temperature tests and contact tracing, the railroads have been haphazard in deploying those measures.Since March, BMWED has determined that there have been 10 coronavirus-related fatalities, with ""hundreds"" of people out sick.""It's the complete lack of direction on the use of these [cleaning] supplies and how to get them,"" Dodd said. ""There is an effort to get cleaning supplies out but it's not a major focus of the railroad company and so a lot of people fall through the cracks.""Another problem is that the burden of ensuring a safe work environment falls on the employee, which is due in part to the broader industry's culture, in which injuries are the fault of the employee because the employee violated the rules, according to Dodd.But the biggest problem is that the railroads differ in their lost-time policies, with some companies offering those policies while others don't. But even if companies offer lost-time policies, it can take months for an employee to collect those benefits, Dodd said. He cited CSX as one company where members have encountered challenges with lost-time policies.As a result, ""we believe there are many more people who are very reluctant to report symptoms in fear that they won't be able to work,"" Dodd said.Dodd attributes what he considers the inconsistent response of the rail industry to the lack of direction from the federal government and the White House on how to cope with the pandemic.Â ""In the beginning, I don't think you could hold the railroads responsible. But a month later, it's time to wake up,"" Dodd said, adding that if the railroads require employees to come to work, they should be the ones responsible for keeping employees as safe as possible.CSX responded to Dodd's assertions about lost-time policies, saying, ""Our highest priority is the safety and well-being of our employees, their families and the communities where we operate. Employees unable to work due to the impacts of COVID may use paid time off entitlements provided under their respective collective bargaining agreements and sickness benefits provided by the Railroad Retirement Board.""Separately, UP said it is giving union-affiliated ""agreement employees"" who have worked at least 30 days during the pandemic a one-time $1,000 gross bonus in December. The bonus applies to all current agreement employees, including those who have been furloughed, who have worked for at least 30 days between March 1 and Nov. 30.""While many fellow citizens were sheltering in place, our craft professionals rolled up their sleeves and answered the nation's call during one of its greatest times of need,"" said UP President and CEO Lance Fritz. ""The pivotal role these essential employees play delivering critical supplies and keeping the economy open cannot be emphasized enough. This recognition reflects how notable their efforts are and how much their great work is appreciated.""Meanwhile, the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) said it is working with the railroads to address pandemic-related safety concerns.Â Coronavirus cases totaled 337,555 nationwide as of Monday, according to the Canadian government, with cases climbing sharply after Oct. 1.""In collaboration with the rail companies, we enhanced cleaning and disinfecting protocols for locomotives, rest facilities and other locations. We also lobbied for paid time off for members who are asked by the company to self-isolate,"" said Lyndon Isaak, TCRC president. ""Although we found common ground for many issues, we are still attempting to address others. Outstanding challenges include safe training methods and maintaining consistent cleaning and disinfecting protocols across the various rail systems.""Isaak continued, ""With cases rising at a dramatic rate in Canada, our goal is to protect rail workers at all costs. We will do this by maintaining pressure on the carriers to ensure that the pandemic protocols are strictly followed and continue to be effective in this fast-changing situation. The stakes are high when it comes to the health and safety of our members. If our rail systems go down, what will happen to our country?""The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, SMART-Transportation Division and the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO didn't respond to requests for comment. Canadian Pacific (NYSE: CP), CN (NYSE: CNI) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) also didn't return requests for comment.Subscribe to FreightWaves' e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related articles:COVID-19 vaccine distribution could start in mid-December, official saysThe Daily Dash: COVID's unexpected impact on the supply chainCOVID lockdown sequel threatens shipping demandSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Weekly Fuel Report: November 23, 2020  * Several C-suite Changes At J.B.

2020-11-16	2020-11-16 20:56:50	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Pan Am, Conversions To Rail And Train Lengths â Oh My!	"A CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) executive confirmed that CSX has talked with short line Pan Am Railways about a possible future involving both companies, but he declined to comment further on the issue.""You might have seen what we've sort of said publicly on Pan Am. We did confirm that we have had discussions with Pan Am about that property. Beyond that, I'm not going to comment any further,"" said CSX's Mark Wallace at the Baird investors conference Thursday. Wallace is the executive vice president for sales and marketing for CSX.Â Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) executives also spoke at the conference (see below).Wallace continued, ""But more broadly, listen. We evaluate how we deploy cash the same way that we always have and we always will, right? We look at investments, whether they're internal investments or things that we're going to do strategically. We look at high-return projects and whether ... it's a great return for our shareholders and whether it helps our customers longer term.""Wallace was referring to recent reports that CSX has been inquiring about acquiring Pan Am. Pan Am has come up in recent months as a company that could be open to an acquisition or for leasing.Wallace added that as CSX evaluates potential investments, the company looks at whether the investment would extend the company's reach and how the investment would benefit shippers.""If we can take our model and overlay that model onto another property and produce the types of returns and results that we have at CSX or ShipCSX, then I think those are things that we would consider doing. So we're always on the lookout for interesting projects. But that's sort of how we evaluate those options, whether it's internal investments or things that we're considering externally,"" Wallace said.Recently, CSX competitor Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) responded to CSX's actions via a Nov. 6 letter to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) saying that it is concerned about a potential acquisition because Norfolk Southern (NS) has joint control with Pan Am over Pan Am Southern, an affiliate. NS is concerned that the way in which CSX is seeking ownership avoids the board's approval of the acquisition.In response to NS' letter to the STB, CSX said it ""has been in discussions with Pan Am Railways Inc. regarding a possible transaction. As part of this effort, CSX has engaged directly with Norfolk Southern to understand any issues they might have.""Besides offering comments about CSX's dealings with Pan Am, Wallace also talked about how it is seeking more highway-to-rail conversion opportunities. CSX has taken steps recently to ""revamp"" and enhance its marketing efforts, utilize new technologies and focus on data and analytics to win customers. Coupled with CSX's efforts to improve rail service, CSX is ""winning share even in this challenging environment,"" Wallace said.To find those conversion opportunities, CSX is looking at where it currently operates and asking existing customers that use both truck and rail whether they would consider moving more volumes to rail. CSX is also speaking with potential customers that have traditionally relied on trucks but are open to talking with CSX about rail because of the tightening truck market, Wallace said.CSX has been able to convert customers to rail in the aggregates sector, as well as in metals and forest products, Wallace said.Â CSX is having conversations with potential and existing customers and is ""really turning tables a little bit and saying, âWe want to be a bigger part of your overall transportation spend and what else can we do to you to improve your flow to get your products to market?'"" Wallace said. ""So those are conversations that are ongoing and we expect to have more success in the coming quarters and years on that front.""Union Pacific watching train lengthsOne of the ways that Union Pacific (UP) has been able to reach productivity savings has been to lengthen trains. UP has also been focusing on freight car velocity and reducing terminal dwell.Â To achieve longer train lengths, UP has been constructing 15,000-foot sidings along some areas of its network and it intends to continue lengthening sidings in 2021, according to Jennifer Hamann, UP's chief financial officer.But while UP's physical infrastructure is one factor toward lengthening trains, others factors include ensuring volume density along the lanes and providing good service to customers, according to Hamann.Â ""I don't know that we know the limit of what that [train length] can be. It has to be kind of a composite look in terms of what are all the factors that are available to us. The footprint, the physical infrastructure: Is it going to limit us?"" Hamann asked last Tuesday. ""It's really going to be dictated more by the volumes that are coming off where they're coming on and how we're able to design the transportation plan around that, to have that long train length as we meet our customers' demands.""During the presentation, Hamann reiterated UP's volume guidance for the fourth quarter, saying that volume growth will be in the ""low single digits, which would be the first quarter with positive year-over-year growth in two years.""As a result, UP expects full-year volumes to be down by 7% or so. Productivity savings will also exceed $700 million and that, coupled with UP's pricing strategy and the volume outlook, could result in an operating ratio in the 50s, Hamann said. Operating ratio (OR) is a tool some investors used to gauge the financial health of a company, with a lower OR implying improved health.Meanwhile, the surcharges that UP placed upon certain intermodal services on the West Coast were in order for UP to protect some of their network capacity, according to Hamann.""We have programs with some of our domestic intermodal customers where they commit to giving us so much volumes over the course of the year and we commit to giving them box availability. And that's really what the surcharges are about, helping protect those customer commitments,"" Hamann said. ""I think they achieved what we wanted them to achieve. It's really about better control of the flows. And I think that they were successful in that and we'll keep them in place as long as we think we need to relative to the rail environment.""Subscribe to FreightWaves' e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related articles:CSX looking to take advantage of tight truck capacityUnion Pacific seeks to sweat its assetsCommentary: Railway insight from New EnglandSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * USPS Limps Away From FY 2020  * 5 Trucking Sustainability Trends For 2021(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-31	2020-10-31 12:00:22	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	The Power of Wind and Women in Wyoming	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- No one warned us about the Wyoming wind. With both hands wrapped tight on the wheel, Iâm fighting gusts that are jerking and shaking the Winnebago, rattling everything, including our nerves. I slow down â 45, 40, 35 â but weâre still getting pushed around. A thumping starts on the roof. Did something come loose? Weâre too close to our camping spot for the night, the Terry Bison Ranch, to stop now.The ranch, just south of Cheyenne, is part Old West theme park and animal zoo, more campy than when Teddy Roosevelt visited in 1910 â feasting on pike, prairie chicken, roast elk and sherbet â but still a respite after a rough ride.When I open the driverâs side door, the wind takes it and tests the strength of the hinge. The door holds but, I now see, the outside canopy did not â it sprang loose from its coil during the drive and is flapping furiously. I attempt to secure it with duct tape but the wind is too strong. Even keeping my balance is difficult, and as the RV shakes back and forth, I wonder: Could this thing tip over on me? Maybe itâs OK to lose the canopy.The ranch hand at check-in is unfazed by the wind â âThatâs Wyomingâ â but the woman behind me delivers some startling news: âWe saw two semis blown over on 80,â the interstate. The obvious is now dawning on me: We should not have been on the road. I finally check the weather report: âHigh Wind Warning â¦ Winds 40 to 50 mph with gusts up to 75 mph â¦ a high risk for vehicle blow overs.â We dodged disaster, though not entirely unscathed. I have no idea how to fix the canopy, but itâs late in the day and Iâm drained. Is the saloon open?âWe donât call it winter here. We call it âwinderâ because when the fall comes, itâs just the winds blowing.â Itâs the next morning and Iâm with Steve Hrkach, a wind energy instructor at Laramie County Community College in Cheyenne. Becoming a wind technician takes two years of science and engineering mixed with critical thinking and hands-on skill development â brains and brawn, Hrkach says. Today, his class of three is practicing emergency rescues on a ladder.âOne of the things we stress in this program is: I guarantee youâre going to get a job. Thereâs tons of jobs. I have companies, recruiters calling me all the time. As a matter of fact, I got an email yesterday asking for names.âThe wind industry is booming in Wyoming. Hrkach says the region has some of the best winds in the country. No kidding. But controversy around wind farms abounds. To skeptics, he says: âHereâs an opportunity for our young people to stay in Wyoming. Weâre great at exporting resources. We have wheat, cattle, coal, natural gas. Unfortunately weâre also exporting our people to get jobs at other places. OK, maybe youâre against green energy and wind. I get that, Iâm OK with that. But 50 years ago, if I told you I was going to sell wind to California, youâd think I was a snake oil salesman.âHe tells me a story to illustrate the difficulty of persuading the opposition.âThe Roundhouse Wind Project is just west of town. They put in 82 turbines, theyâre trying to put in another 20-some turbines. A woman living in that area came to talk to me about wind energy and to get some information, but really she just came to voice her displeasure. But she would keep saying, âWell they say thisâ and âThey say that.â And I said, âWell, who are they? Tell me who are you getting your facts from?â She said, âJust they.â She didnât have anything. And so I started presenting her with some facts, like the Federal Wildlife does a study on bird kills and how many birds are actually killed by turbines and how weâve tried to mitigate that. And that was a big problem. And so she said, âI donât believe that.ââI said, âWhat do you mean you donât believe that?âââI donât believe that.ââI said, âWell youâre willing to believe âthey,â who we donât know who they are, but when I give you actual organizations that have done studies, you just discredit them.ââRusty is up on the ladder practicing a rescue, secure in a harness, weighed down by tools, and handling pulleys and clamps. At 35, heâs the senior statesman of the class. He previously worked as a heavy-equipment operator for a company that staged mass gatherings, including concerts and festivals. The live entertainment industry collapsed in March, and with no return to work in sight, he enlisted in the program.âI really wanted to keep in an industry that was going to allow me to travel, and something that I could take internationally if I wanted to. And coming from a company that has a real focus on environmentalism and conservationâ â the events company worked to minimize waste â âI really didnât want to jump into a field that was the antithesis of that. I didnât want to jump into oil or gas or any non-renewable resources, and wind really stuck out. ... Iâve always been mechanically inclined. Iâve always liked taking things apart and putting them back together. And I think this is going to be a fun thing to go and troubleshoot and have a different problem every day, in a different place every day.âThe chance for upward mobility within the profession also appealed to him. âThatâs definitely been a consideration. One of my goals for doing this is to be a crew lead so that I can assemble a crew of people that I trust and people that work well together to go and do the best job that we can. Having worked in live music, Iâve run into nearly every problem that you can run into when you have people gathered and people working.âHas he faced any of the criticism that Hrkach has dealt with? âSome of my family does work in oil. So, thereâs been some pushback there. Thereâs been some passive-aggressive Facebook posts saying how oil is so much better than wind and stuff like that. But for the most part, a lot of my friends and family have seen this as sort of a natural progression and are very supportive of this. Very supportive.âI ask Hrkach if they ever talk about climate change in class. âWeâre mechanics, weâre not politicians, weâre not corporate business people, weâre not shaping public opinion, weâre just out there to do a job. And we want to do it well. In order for turbines to be successful, they have to run. And if theyâre not running, that gives opposing sides ammunition. So if we can keep those turbines running, operating at peak efficiency, making power, providing energy for the United States, who can argue with that?âJust past the highest point on the Lincoln Highway â marked by a Lincoln monument sculpted in Mexico and originally placed on the two-lane road, only to be moved to an I-80 rest stop beside the bathrooms, perhaps the most American of all tributes â lies Laramie, Wyoming, home to the University of Wyoming Cowboys and the first woman to cast a ballot in an election: Louisa Swain in 1870, a year after Wyoming became the first government in the Western world to legalize female suffrage. Democrats pushed it through the territorial legislature at least partly to embarrass the Republican governor â they expected him to veto it, even as he supported Black suffrage and the passage of the 15th Amendment. Instead, he signed the bill and vetoed the Democratic effort to repeal it two years later, when legislators realized that Wyoming women strongly favored Republican candidates. They came within one vote of overriding the veto.Voting laws have always been tied up in partisan politics. In Laramie, sitting in Susan Simpsonâs backyard, she and Katie Morgan â the president and treasurer of the Wyoming League of Women Voters, respectively â are telling me about their efforts to make it easier to register to vote and cast a ballot.Says Simpson: âIn Wyoming, people who apply to be a registered voter have to have their signature notarized. And the county clerks think that they are the only people who can register votersâ â all but requiring people to visit the clerkâs office to register. There is no online registration, and voter registration drives are effectively illegal. âWe would like to be able to do voter registration drives, because then we could ask permission to have peopleâs phone numbers or emails. And we could text them and remind them to vote on Election Day, and that increases turnout. â¦ Our turnout is despicable.âThis year because of Covid-19, the Republican secretary of state sent out absentee voter applications to every registered voter in the state. âItâs wonderful,â says Simpson. âHe said 66,000 absentee ballots had been turned in.â They would like to see the state adopt vote by mail.Morgan makes the case: âMy daughter lives in Colorado, sheâs a college student there and she loves it. She says, âThis is great, mom â they send you your ballot, you fill it out, thereâs all sorts of drop boxes or you mail it.â Voting by mail would certainly be great in Wyoming for a couple of reasons. We are so physically distanced, sometimes itâs hard for people to get in to vote. And in November, we can have horrible weather here and that makes it difficult for older people, or even younger people.âBut they are realists, says Morgan. âIâm not optimistic that will happen in the short term, given our current state government.â Why? Partisan politics. âThe pushback against some of the voting reforms that we see now arise more out of input from the national policy of the Republican Party. Thatâs whoâs in charge in Wyoming and has been for a while. So, itâs not really arising out of any issues that we can see in Wyoming per se, but pushback from the national party pushing into the state.âAs Iâve seen elsewhere along the route, itâs become hard to say that all politics is local.We are grounded in Laramie for an extra day because of another high-wind advisory, time enough to visit the old prison that once housed Butch Cassidy. Iâm now checking the forecast every hour and realizing that for the next few days the morning hours will be the only safe time to drive, and even that will be tense.After dropping off our absentee ballots at the Laramie post office, we take the Lincoln Highway north to Medicine Bow, seeing dozens of wind turbines, a herd of antelope, the nearly deserted town of Rock River, and not a lot else â even the distant mountains are shrouded in clouds. The old Virginian Hotel, an elegant holdover from the heyday of the Lincoln Highway and the Union Pacific, which stopped across the street, is open for business and serving what may the largest pancake and egg sandwich in the world. Business is good, the cook-waiter-busser-cashier tells us, though we have the restaurant nearly to ourselves.By the time we get to Rawlins, Wyoming, the winds are back up above 25 mph â time to call it a day. The KOA campground has already closed for the season, and the owner, Marilyn Godfrey, says the year ended on a high note after a tough start. Not only did campers end up coming en masse, but temporary wind industry workers, some building towers but more installing transmission lines, came and stayed for months.âA lot of them travel with their families. They live in their trailers and theyâre pretty much transient workers. They just move from job to job. And with the wind farms being across the country, they have to go from one place to the other. A lot of young kids in their early 20s.âItâs been good for the town. âRawlins is a boom-and-bust economy. And so our boom times are when the transient workers come, or the oil field workers. The bust is when they are not here. Economically, [wind] is a huge driver for Rawlins.âWe plan to leave Rawlins at daybreak to avoid the worst of the wind, but we still wake up to a shaking RV. Another morning of stressful driving lies ahead, but at least we wonât have to worry about thumping on the roof. The main RV dealer in town wouldnât see us â too busy with appointments â but a mobile repairman was willing to take a look at our canopy and happened to have the part needed to re-secure it.Wind techs may be in high demand, but RV repair seems like a pretty good career opportunity, too.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Frank Barry is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion.

2020-10-23	2020-10-23 19:18:24	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Union Pacific Seeks To Sweat Its Assets	"With rail volumes expected to improve year-over-year in the fourth quarter and into 2021, Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) will seek to fine-tune its deployment of precision scheduled railroading (PSR) by continuing to focus on asset productivity. This includes taking measures such as lengthening trains farther and speeding up the network.UP expects ""positive year-over-year growth"" in the fourth quarter. Coupled with positive volumes in the first quarter, the company expects full-year volumes to be down by around 7%.""Locomotives are going to be way more productive. Our train length, I see 10,000 feet, OK? I see our car freight velocity up another 5% or 10%. So I think that we are just starting,"" said Union Pacifc (UP) Chief Operating Officer Jim Vena during the company's third-quarter earnings call Thursday.Â UP announced earlier in the week that Vena, who joined UP in January 2019, would be moving into a senior advisory role at the start of 2021 before retiring in June.Vena continued, ""The mechanisms, the measures, the culture is all there to succeed. And I am not worried about it. And I am going to keep my Union Pacific stock. I'm not going to go out there and sell it because I'm very confident that we're going to do the right thing.""While productivity measures are anticipated to help UP next year, other factors could determine how much profit will arise from moving different types of commodities. How much volumes improve is one uncertainty, while another is the commodity mix.Â ""Productivity is going to continue. That will be a help. We haven't nailed down that target, but it's going to be healthy. And we've got plenty of initiatives moving into next year that we'll keep a shoulder into,"" Vena said.Â But ""mix is a real big question mark. I don't see much reason to change our current mix experience until the industrial economy really starts recovering a little bit quicker and with more strength than we've seen so far post our trough in May,"" Vena said. ""So that's the biggest question mark, I think, that will dictate just how much margin improvement we are able to attain next year.""Meanwhile, efficiency measures such as consolidating intermodal operations in Chicago and improving network speed will help UP compete against its competitors, including not just Western U.S. railroad BNSF (NYSE: BRK) but also Canadian Pacific (NYSE: CP) and CN (NYSE: CNI) for businesses seeking access to the U.S. or Canadian West Coast ports, Vena said.""The railroad is as fluid as it ever has been. We do not have a capacity issue. And in fact we are spending money to actually make it more efficient,"" Vena said. In the third quarter, UP and others within the supply chain got tangled from congestion at the U.S. West Coast ports as inland customers were restocking their inventories.Measures such as improving customer visibility at the ports and working with the ports to ensure more efficient service and moving containers out quicker will also help UP compete, he said.UP executives also said the company has gotten more domestic and international intermodal business, including a contract win for international intermodal. UP has also grown its e-commerce business and increased its exposure to retailers in the parcel sector, executives said.""The team has done a great job of inserting [intermodal] product into our supply chain. Whether it's match-backs in Dallas, whether it's reloads out of the Midwest, we're doing everything we can to make it sticky for our customers,"" said Kenny Rocker, executive vice president of marketing and sales.""We've worked with the ports to set some really strong standards to get out of the port, working with Jim's team. I talked about the technology on the API side, where we're working with our largest international carriers so that we can have visibility [as] to when they come in. ... So we're taking a ... very proactive approach to winning in those markets,"" Kenny said.Meanwhile, as Canadian Pacific and CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) shared in their third-quarter earnings call this week, UP is also developing its real estate assets.Â View more earnings on UNP""We've been assessing our land, looking at our land. I won't go into details of where we are and how we think about it longer term, but I can tell you that we would expect to take advantage of the resources near the port,"" Rocker said.Vena pointed to UP's work with a property developer to develop land around the Dallas intermodal terminal.Â ""There's opportunities like that that we either have in the hopper or have already executed or are beginning development plans for,"" Vena said.Third-quarter financial resultsIn the third quarter, average train length increased by 28% to approximately 9,000 feet. UP has also completed 28 15,000-foot sidings, which allow for longer trains in both directions and will result in reducing train starts.

2020-10-23	2020-10-23 07:19:56	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Union Pacific Slips 6% As Lower Freight Volumes Drag On Earnings	Shares of Union Pacific Corporation plunged 6.2% on Thursday after the company reported weaker-than-expected 3Q results, reflecting lower freight volumes. The freight-hauling railroad companyâs earnings per share of $2.02 fell short of Street estimates of $2.06 and marked a year-on-year decline of 9%. Its 3Q revenues declined 11% year-over-year to $4.92 billion and missed analystsâ expectation of $4.93 billion.Union Pacificâs (UNP) freight volumes took a hit from lower economic activities amid COVID-19 pandemic. However, the increase in core pricing partially offset the aforementioned negative impact during the quarter.Union Pacificâs total 3Q volumes, as measured by total carload revenue, dropped 4% year-over-year. The largest publicly traded US railroad company recorded freight revenue decline across all its three major categories. During the quarter, Bulk, Industrial, and Premium revenues slipped 12%, 18%, and 1%, respectively. (See UNP stock analysis on TipRanks).Nonetheless, Union Pacific recorded 0.8 points year-over-year improvement in operating ratio and achieved an all-time quarterly record operating ratio of 58.7% during the quarter. A 35% year-over-year decline in per gallon average quarterly diesel fuel prices positively impacted 3Q operating ratio by 100 basis points.Following its quarterly results, Cowen & Co. analystÂ Jason SeidlÂ raised the stockâs price target by $1 to $216 (15.4% upside potential) and reiterated a Buy rating. In a note to investors, Seidl wrote, âThe company has made great strides towards improving its OR (operating ratio) through the adoption of Precision Scheduled Railroading. With better rail service, we believe the focus will shift towards growing the top-line.âCurrently, the Street has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus is based on 15 Buys and 4 Holds. With shares up 3.5% year-to-date, the averageÂ price targetÂ of $204.16 implies a further upside potential of over 9% to current levels.Related News:   CSX Approves $5B Share Buyback; Shares Gain 4%   American Airlines Posts $2.4B Quarterly Loss; Street Sees 22% Downside   Landstarâs 4Q Profit Outlook Tops Estimates; Street Sticks To Hold More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Kimberly Clark Sinks 7% On 3Q Earnings Miss   * BJâs Restaurants Shares Drop Despite 3Q Revenue Beat   * Gileadâs Covid-19 Remdesivir Drug Scores FDA Approval; Shares Surge   * Intel Sinks 9% As 3Q Data-Center Sales Disappoint	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-slips-6-lower-071956180.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-22	2020-10-22 16:04:55	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Union Pacific Slumps on Drop in Lucrative Auto, Coal Shipments	(Bloomberg) -- Union Pacific Corp. slumped the most in four months after declines for some of its most profitable cargoes dragged on the railroadâs profit.Adjusted earnings for the largest publicly traded railroad in the U.S. fell to $2.01 a share for the third quarter, missing analystsâ expectations by 4 cents. Sharp drops in volume for coal and autos sent sales tumbling 11% from a year earlier, even though total carloads fell just 4%. Union Pacificâs $4.92 billion in revenue was in line with estimates compiled by Bloomberg,Intermodal cargo climbed 9.4%. But that category, mostly consumer goods handed off to trucks for final delivery, is a lower margin business than moving coal hoppers and car transporters.âUP was able to outperform our more cautious expectations on mix in the quarter but still fell short of consensus expectations,â Brian Ossenbeck, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a note to clients Thursday.Railroads were whipsawed by a historic plunge in second-quarter volume because of coronavirus lockdowns and a snap back in the third quarter as businesses began to reopen. Union Pacificâs carloads jumped 19% in the third quarter from the second, according to a statement.The stock fell 6.3% to $186.93 at 11:45 a.m. in New York after tumbling as much as 6.8%, the biggest intraday drop since June 11. The decline was the sharpest on the Standard & Poorâs industrials index.Union Pacific has held the line on costs, in part by keeping its workforce 18% below least yearâs levels even as volume returned. Operating ratio, a measure of efficiency in which a lower number is better, improved to a record 58.7% from 59.5% a year earlier.The company forecast volume will be down 7% for the year, better than the 10% decline projected in July.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-slumps-drop-lucrative-160455817.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-22	2020-10-22 14:11:44	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Union Pacific Sets All-time Quarterly Record For Operating Ratio	"Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) eked out an all-time quarterly record operating ratio (OR) in the third quarter despite a 11% drop in operating revenue.Union Pacific's (UP) OR was 58.7% for the quarter, compared with 59.5% in the third quarter of 2019, amid lower fuel prices.Â Investors sometimes use OR, which is operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, to gauge the financial health of a company. A lower OR implies improved financial health.Meanwhile, net income was $1.4 billion, or $2.01 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $1.6 billion, or $2.22 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2019.  (Union Pacific)""Our third-quarter results represent another step in our company's transformation. We demonstrated our ability to efficiently adjust to a sharp rebound in volume, which increased 19% from the second quarter, while operating expenses, excluding fuel price changes, increased only 11% sequentially,"" said Lance Fritz, Union Pacific chairman, president and chief executive officer.Â Operating revenue fell 11% year-over-year to $4.9 billion amid a 4% decrease in revenue carloads. Although volumes from UP's premium segment, which includes intermodal, rose 1% year-over-year, industrial volumes slipped 18% and bulk volumes fell 12%.Freight revenue in the third quarter also fell 11% ""as core pricing gains were more than offset by lower volumes, a less favorable business mix and decreased fuel surcharge revenue,"" UP said.But operating expenses were lower in the third quarter year-over-year, falling 12% to $2.9 billion. Meanwhile, UP's average quarterly diesel fuel price was 35% lower, at $1.36 per gallon. Indeed, UP's fuel expenses fell 40% to $301 million year-over-year.

2020-10-21	2020-10-21 14:14:46	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Earnings Outlook For Union Pacific	"On Thursday, October 22, Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) will release its latest earnings report. Here is Benzinga's outlook for the company.Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equates to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.Earnings And Revenue Wall Street analysts see Union Pacific reporting earnings of $2.05 per share on sales of $4.96 billion. Union Pacific reported a per-share profit of $2.22 when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $5.52 billion.What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values.View more earnings on UNPIf the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Thursday, earnings would be down 7.66%. Revenue would be down 10.08% from the same quarter last year. Union Pacific's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this:Quarter Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2019  EPS Estimate 1.52 1.90 2.06 2.33  EPS Actual 1.67 2.15 2.02 2.22  Revenue Estimate 4.37 B 5.08 B 5.27 B 5.63 B  Revenue Actual 4.24 B 5.23 B 5.21 B 5.52 B  Stock Performance For a full 12 months, the return has risen by 18.61%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably relaxed going into this earnings release. Long-term shareholders are already enjoying 12-month gains prior to the announcement.See more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Operating on more than 30,000 miles of track in the western two thirds of the U.S., UP generated $22 billion of revenue in 2019 by hauling coal, industrial products, intermodal containers, agriculture goods, chemicals, and automotive goods. UP owns about one fourth of Mexican railroad Ferromex and derives about 10% of its revenue hauling freight to and from Mexico.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9c6f2b38-c86b-31db-ae75-ce3ec5e47ea6/analyst-report%3A-union-pacific.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-09-23	2020-09-23 16:09:14	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Class I Railroads Eye US-Mexico Intermodal Opportunities	"The U.S. Class I railroads say they're ready to handle any influx of business that might occur at the U.S.-Mexico border as a result of nearshoring and shifting consumer patterns.The trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada (USMCA) helped to lay a foundation for continued trade among the three countries, while the coronavirus pandemic has raised some questions about expanding sourcing beyond China.Â Tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as consumers' preferences to access goods more readily, have also factored into the issue of nearshoring.""With our network, capacity and expertise, BNSF's Mexico intermodal service is well-positioned to help shippers take advantage of anticipated growth in the movement of consumer goods to and from Mexico,"" Paul Hirsch told FreightWaves. Hirsch is the assistant vice president of the Mexico business unit for Western railroad BNSF (NYSE: BRK).Hirsch said shifting trends in the U.S. and Mexico in what consumers expect when they purchase goods ""is driving different requirements for those of us that are part of the supply chain.""""In this changing world, supply chain partners must work together to make the process more responsive and adaptable. Intermodal is part of the transportation strategy for some of the largest cross-border shippers because it reduces their risk, increases their capacity and reduces cost,"" Hirsch said.Â Among the offerings that BNSF has that it could use to capitalize on increased cross-border rail volumes are a joint intermodal service with Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU). The service runs five days a week between Monterrey, San Luis PotosÃ­ or Toluca in Mexico to/from Dallas/Fort Worth or Chicago, with additional southbound service to Laredo, Texas. BNSF also has connections with Ferrocarril Mexicano, which ""offers the region a simple way to reduce trucking costs and delays,"" Hirsch said. That service provides intermodal service between Chicago and Silao.Â Hisrch also said BNSF has a bilingual intermodal sales team in the U.S. and Mexico who are knowledgeable on U.S.-Mexico import/export requirements, and it facilities cross-border shipments at San Diego, El Paso, Eagle Pass, Laredo and Brownsville, with potential originations and destinations along the West Coast and the Pacific Northwest.Â ""We have seen continued growth for all these service options and moving forward we will continue to introduce new ones that meet our customers' demands,"" Hirsch said.Meanwhile, Kansas City Southern's (KCS) President and CEO Pat Ottensmeyer recently said at a trade symposium sponsored by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection that Mexico stands to benefit from more companies moving manufacturing to North America amid pandemic-induced international trade disruptions.""We believe that with the USMCA in place, there is more certainty about North American trade going forward and the company's strategy is aligned with our customers' cross-border needs,"" KCS told FreightWaves.Â To accommodate growing volumes, KCS is seeking to add more international crews at the bridge in Laredo, Texas, to improvise network fluidity there, and it is building a second international bridge. KCS recently received a presidential permit to build a second bridge at Laredo, and the bridge could handle up to 30 cross-border crossings daily.The railroad is also working ""with beneficial owners to learn about each other's needs to grow this very important corridor,"" KCS said.Â ""KCS is focused on growing cross-border volumes. We are working with our channel and railroad partners to improve service and add markets that we do not yet serve,"" KCS said.In Houston, KCS has an intermodal and automotive terminal at Kendleton, Texas, which services the Houston and Mexico markets, KCS said. The terminal still has available capacity for intermodal and automotive, and there is KCS-owned land around the terminal available for development. KCS also said it has industrial development professionals in the U.S. and Mexico to assist businesses looking to expand and build their nearshoring capabilities.Â Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) is also seeking to develop its intermodal assets in Houston, with investments planned between Englewood and Settegast.The company said last month that it was consolidating its intermodal operations in the Houston area this fall as part of its broader efforts to implement its version of precision scheduled railroading and simplify ramp operations.Â At the Settegast facility, Union Pacific (UP) will continue to handle its current intermodal and manifest business and it will take on the intermodal shipments currently managed by the Englewood yard. The Englewood facility will then have additional capacity for UP's manifest operations. UP intends to expand switching capability at the Englewood yard as a means to run longer trains out of that yard.""This shift will further improve the network fluidity in the Houston area, providing you with safer and more consistent service â a major win for all customers,"" said UP Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales Kenny Rocker last month.UP executives have said that nearshoring could benefit customers who are ""on the margin"" and who were impacted by the coronavirus-related factory shutdowns in China earlier this year and by subsequent shutdowns within the U.S. supply chain.Â ""We haven't seen any customers make any really concrete bets yet on their shoring. I will tell you, we feel good about the service product and the interchange points that we have coming out of Mexico,"" Rocker said during UP's second-quarter earnings call in July. UP has said it is the only U.S. carrier with access to six gateways with Mexico. ""The one thing that a number of folks have really harped on ... is our premium and our intermodal network. And what I'll tell you is that our manifest network, our carload network, benefits from a stronger service product.""Â Rocker continued, ""A lot of these short-term, short-haul lanes we're able to compete in are because we do have a lower cost structure. ... And so as you think about nearshoring, it becomes more of a sweet spot for us and we'll be prepared for it if it comes on.""Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related articles:Borderlands: Mexican rail blockade costing millions; Toyota, VW expanding in MexicoUSMCA pushes Asian company to expand in MexicoCommentary: Is outlook for Mexico's rail freight still relevant?New USMCA trade deal could increase demand for nearshoring in MexicoCommentary: USMCA is imminentSee more from Benzinga  * Container Rates Are On Fire.

2020-09-17	2020-09-17 18:33:48	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Weekly US Rail Traffic Falls On Holiday Comps	"Weekly U.S. rail traffic slipped nearly 10% in a week that was shorter than usual because of Labor Day.U.S. rail volumes for the week ending Saturday totaled 474,785 carloads and intermodal units, a 9.9% drop compared with the same period in 2019, according to the Association of American Railroads. Labor Day was Sept. 7.Â Intermodal traffic was lower amid the holiday weekend, breaking the upward trend of the last few weeks. Weekly U.S. intermodal volumes slipped 5% to 260,643 containers and trailers. Meanwhile, U.S. carloads totaled 214,142, down 15.2% from a year ago.Year-to-date U.S. traffic totaled 17 million carloads and intermodal units, which is 11.2% lower than last year.  U.S. rail volumes over the past year. This chart shows carloads (in blue: RTOTC.USA), intermodal trailers (in orange: RTOIT.CLASSI) and intermodal containers (in green: RTOIC.CLASS). (SONAR)Despite weekly dip last week, US intermodal volumes still poised to trend higherA number of factors support the possibility that rail volumes could continue their upward trend for some commodities through the end of the year. Grain shippers are anticipating a strong export market, while consumer spending ahead of the winter holiday season could provide some support for intermodal movements in the third and fourth quarters.""Container imports into the West Coast were exceptionally strong in July and August, trucking capacity remains very tight and consumer freight demand should strengthen into the fourth quarter,"" said a Wednesday research note from FreightWaves Passport.The note observed that train velocity has slowed in recent weeks, which could translate into network capacity nearing its limits in some regions.""Average intermodal train speeds are slowing: The blended average speed for Class I intermodal trains is just over 30 mph, its lowest level of 2020. At this point, we don't expect meaningful improvements in capacity availability or network fluidity this year,"" the note continued.Meanwhile, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could factor into how rail volumes perform as fall approaches. E-commerce has helped to support consumer spending numbers, but many businesses are still operating under capacity as social distancing restrictions remain.""Retail spending habits have remained largely consistent and stable these past few months since stores began to reopen. Some consumers likely reduced their spending with the end of the $600 supplemental unemployment benefits for those out of work, but a building up of savings from that and other government cash helped support spending,"" said National Retail Federation Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz.Â Kleinherz was reacting to figures from the U.S. Census Bureau that determined that consumer spending was up 0.6% on a seasonally adjusted basis from July and up 2.6% year-over-year. August's figure contrasts with the 0.9% month-over-month increase seen in July.Â He continued, ""At this juncture, it is difficult to sort out how much economic activity is due to government support and how much is evidence of hardcore demand due to recent job gains. August numbers might have been higher if not for small businesses struggling with reopening and the return to full operations.""Union Pacific celebrates New York Stock Exchange presence for 150 yearsAlthough e-commerce has the potential to modify supply chains and near-term events such as the COVID-19 pandemic cause manufacturers to reconsider their sourcing options, Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) celebration on being listed on the New York Stock Exchange for 150 years reminds stakeholders and the broader public of the longevity of freight railroads in North America.Â UP celebrated the anniversary by virtually ringing the closing bell Tuesday.The company said it traded initially at less than $27 per share. Since then, it has undergone seven stock splits and paid dividends on common stock for 121 consecutive years. UP closed Wednesday at $201.42 per share.""It is an honor to celebrate this historic milestone and the company's ascension to the longest-listed transportation company and largest railroad traded on the New York Stock Exchange with the financial community and our dedicated employees,"" said UP President and CEO Lance Fritz, who led the virtual ringing. ""Their relentless focus on our customers is transforming Union Pacific more than 150 years after President Abraham Lincoln founded our company.""Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related articles:Grain shippers brace for tight rail marketInvestor conference highlights bullish truckload market; intermodal demand returnsUS weekly intermodal volumes push higherÂ See more from Benzinga  * China Imports Soar, Up Almost 90% Year-Over-Year (With Video)  * Real Estate Roundup: Industrial Real Estate Grabs Attention Of Big-time Investors  * Mack Will Sell Electric Garbage Trucks In 2021(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Laura's path suggested that Union Pacific (UP) and Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE: BRK) BNSF likely bore the brunt of the storm among the railroads serving the region.As a result of the damage, UP issued an embargo covering 27 stations in the Lake Charles area. UP's Houston-area rail yards, however, were left undamaged and are expected to reopen Thursday.Â UP's Intermodal terminal in Avondale, Louisiana is slated to also reopen on Thursday along with the two intermodal terminals in Houston, the railway said.The impact on BNSF wasn't clear yet. The railway is inspecting tracks in the Houston, Galveston and Beaumont, Texas, areas, and is waiting to assess the damage in Louisiana.Â &quot;Once conditions allow, [we] will assess our operations in Louisiana,&quot; a BNSFÂ  spokesperson told FreightWaves in an email. &quot;We will continue to reroute train traffic as needed to ensure the safety of our people and our customers' freight arrives securely at its final destination.&quot;Mike Baudendistel, a market expert at Freightwaves, said BNSF tracks likely suffered a similar fate as UP's.&quot;BNSF goes through Lake Charles as well so their track is probably just as damaged,&quot; Baudendistel said.Â Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE: CNI) could also see significant impacts from the hurricane because of its effects on the chemical plants it serves on the Gulf Coast, Baudendistel said.Click for more FreightWaves articles by Nate TabakFiles from TFI's Canpar leak after ransomware attackRansomware attack hits TFI's Canadian courier divisionsCyberattack impacting multiple EVRAZ plants in US, CanadaSee more from Benzinga  * Class I Railroads Brace For Tropical Storms Marco And Laura  * US Intermodal Traffic Higher For Second Consecutive Week  * Union Pacific Says Its California Police Force Won't Check Immigration Status(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-04	2020-08-04 14:00:00	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Union Pacific Says Its California Police Force Won't Check Immigration Status	Union Pacific's (NYSE: UNP) police force will not ask for the immigration status of people it comes across on Union Pacific's network in California, nor will the railroad work with any joint law enforcement task force whose sole purpose is to identify, detain or deport people who entered the U.S. illegally.These actions are according to Union Pacific's (UP) police force order, dated March 2020.UP's March order was in the news last week because the Southern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recently agreed to settle allegations that it refused to turn over documents that alluded to a relationship between ICE and UP.Â Civil liberties groups had filed a Freedom of Information Act request in September 2018 to receive ICE documents about its relationship with UP, according to the ACLU. The groups subsequently sued ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in March 2019.Â The groups argued that on six occasions, UP's police force detained individuals and then transferred custody of the individuals to ICE. The groups contended that the individuals were targeted because of their race or ethnicity and that their detention violated the Fourth Amendment, according to court filings.ICE settled with the groups before the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division, on July 26 for $15,000. That settlement dismisses the case against ICE.Â The groups involved in the lawsuit were the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Western State College of Law Immigration Clinic, Public Counsel and Esperanza Immigrant Rights Project at Catholic Charities.Meanwhile, as the lawsuit was occurring, the Southern California chapter of the ACLU said that it and other groups had pressed UP in a March 2019 &quot;demand letter&quot;Â  to address allegations that UP's railroad police had unconstitutionally stopped, arrested and detained individuals based on their race or ethnicity, and then transferred them to ICE.&quot;UP's collaboration with ICE threatened immigrant families and was inconsistent with the California Values Act,&quot; said Jessica Bansal, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Foundation of Southern California. &quot;We are pleased the new policy cuts ties with ICE and will be monitoring closely to ensure the troubling practices revealed by the FOIA litigation do not return.&quot;ICE told FreightWaves that it doesn't comment on the specifics of litigation proceedings or outcomes.SpeakingÂ on background on the agency's immigration policies, an ICE official said it does not request for or expect non-immigration officials to enforce immigration statutes.Union Pacific's ResponseOf last week's developments, UP said it &quot;remains committed to full observance with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations.Â  Consistent with this commitment, Union Pacific has policies in place to ensure its interactions with ICE are consistent with both Federal and California law.&quot;UP's March order says as a general policy, &quot;personnel who encounter a non-employee on Union Pacific property shall not (a) use suspected immigration status as a factor in determining whether to confront, detain, or arrest the person; (b) ask the person to disclose his or her immigration status; (c) order the person to produce immigration documents; or (d) initiate contact with a federal immigration agency to report the person. UPPD personnel may contact any law enforcement agency at any time to request additional assistance if necessary for officer safety.&quot;Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related articles:CBP finds 48 alleged stowaways in BNSF, UP trains at borderTSA to require freight railroads to provide training addressing terrorist threatsGAO critical of &quot;outdated&quot; inspection practices at U.S. ports by Customs and Border Protection agentsPhoto by Levi Saunders on UnsplashSee more from Benzinga  * Weekly Fuel Report: August 3, 2020  * &quot;Land Is Plentiful&quot; For APM Terminals Mobile Seaport Growth  * Ports Remain Closed After Hurricane Isaias Makes Landfall(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-03	2020-08-03 14:26:01	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Do Railroad Takeovers Only Happen in Crises?	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The time may finally be right for another big railroad deal. All it took was another economic downdraft.Private equity firms Blackstone Group Inc. andÂ Global Infrastructure Partners are reportedly weighing a joint bid for Kansas City Southern that would value the railroad at about $21 billion including debt. Any takeover would also add to an aggressive flurry of dealmaking over the past few days after a pandemic-inspired lull. Siemens Healthineers AG agreed to buy U.S. radiotherapy company Varian Medical Systems Inc. for about $16 billion, while 7-Eleven owner Seven & i Holdings Co. is paying $21 billion for Marathon Petroleum Corp.âs Speedway gas stations. Waiting in the wings is a potential takeover of the popular video-sharing app TikTokÂ and a Nvidia Corp. buyout of SoftBank Group Corp.âs Arm Ltd. chip-designing business. The sudden rash of dealmaking suggests buyers with supple balance sheets are getting more comfortable with the trajectory of an eventual recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, even as cases surge again.Itâs notable that railroads may beÂ included in this latest deal frenzy. There hasnât been aÂ major takeover of a North American railroad since Warren Buffettâs Berkshire Hathaway Inc. struck a $36 billion deal forÂ Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 2009. There wereÂ attempts byÂ Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. under the leadership of legendary railroader Hunter Harrison to seek a merger first withÂ CSX Corp. in 2014 and then Norfolk Southern Corp. in 2015, but the carrierÂ wasÂ rebuffed each time amid antitrust concerns. The failed talks showed the hurdles forÂ any merger between the largest North American train operators after a wave of dealmaking in the late 1990s consolidated the industry into effectively seven main players, of which Kansas City Southern is the smallest and one of the few withÂ major infrastructure in Mexico. As Buffett proved, though, a private investor is a different story.Â The irony may be that Harrison, a big believer in the benefits of consolidation who died in 2017, may have done more to prolong the lull in railroad dealmaking than bring it back. Before his death, Harrison served a brief term as CEO of CSX. His tenure there was tumultuous and he managed to ruffle quite a few feathers, but in the end,Â he was able to proveÂ to both investors and his fellow railroad CEOsÂ thatÂ his signature âprecision-scheduled railroadingâ âÂ a strategy for reducing theÂ capital, cars andÂ people needed to run trains efficiently âÂ could work for U.S. carriers.Analysts had previous contended the U.S. railroadsâÂ circuitous lines across mountainous terrain would make it more difficult for them to reach the levels of profitability that Harrison had produced at Canadian Pacific and at Canadian National Railway Co. before that. Posthumously, nearly all of his rivals âÂ from Union Pacific Corp. to Norfolk Southern and, yes,Â Kansas City SouthernâÂ have adopted some form of precision-scheduled railroading. Burlington Northern is the only odd man out. The problem with this for would-be buyers of railroads is that this push for efficiency has increased both the profit margins and the stock prices of said railroads.Â Before news of the potential private equity approach on Friday, Kansas City Southern was actually up about 2% for the year, compared with a nearly 12% slide for the S&P 500 Industrial Index and a virtually flat performance for the broader benchmark. The reported $21 billion price tag would value Kansas City Southern at a premium to its all-timeÂ high set in February and Bloomberg Intelligence analysts warn even that may not be high enough.Â To justify a deal at these levels, the private equity buyers would have to be able to argue that the full scale of profit improvements under precision-scheduled railroading isnât fully appreciated by the public markets. Itâs hard to see how they do that. In January, before the worst of the pandemic, Kansas City Southern had predicted it would meet its 2021 goal of bringing its operating ratio âÂ a measure of profitability where a lower number is better â down to the range of 60% to 61% a year early. The pandemic obviously undermined those plans. But even amid the sharpÂ slump in volumes thatâs ensued over the intervening months, Kansas City Southern in JulyÂ raised its target for estimated cost savings this year to $95 million, excluding benefits from labor cuts and lease negotiations. ThatâsÂ up from $61 million. After the rally on the deal news, the company trades at about 22Â times estimated 2021 earnings, above the valuation commanded by other railroads that are further along in the process of precision-scheduled railroading.This makes any transaction more of a bet on the future of trade between the U.S. and Mexico and a push to relocate manufacturing away from China. Itâs a decent wager given the recent resurgence of interest among U.S. industrial companies to consider factories a bit closer to home. The caveat to that is Mexicoâs more volatile regulatory and political environment. Amidst the pandemic, many manufacturers complained of a harsher approach to factory lockdowns across the border than in the U.S., a sign that the potential for supply-chain disruptions lingers even with the recently signed United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Iâm reminded of an interview with Harrison that I participated inÂ at Bloomberg headquarters in 2015: âI donât like Kansas City Southern because of theÂ MexicoÂ play,â he said.Â âI donât likeÂ Mexico. I like to play in an arena where I know the rules, and I understand what might happen. Thatâs crazy down there.âÂ This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-07-28	2020-07-28 14:22:29	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	N95 Masks Aren't the Only Thing in Demand	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Dissecting earnings reports is always more of an art than a science. Thatâs particularly true in a pandemic, when the state of play changes at an ever-faster clip. With a surge in coronavirus cases in the U.S. Sun Belt and burgeoning concerns about a second wave in Europe and parts of Asia, any glimmers of insight from companies who operate on the ground floor of the economy carry extra weight.Â Nearly fiveÂ months into this pandemic, CEOs in the manufacturing sector appear to at least have a handle on whatâs happening with their businesses, for better or for worse. Tuesday brought results from three companies that sit at key fault lines in the industrial economy: 3M Co., Rockwell Automation Inc. and Raytheon Technologies Corp.Â Here are my top takeaways:Â 3M Co. :Â The maker of N95 masks has been on the front lineÂ of the pandemic, but even in normal recessions, itâs usually one of the first companies to see the early signs of a recovery, given the fast turnaround time for many of its products. So itâs particularly encouraging that 3M says itâs actually seeing July sales trending up by a low-single digit percentageÂ compared to a year earlier. That compares with a 13.1% decline on an organic basis in the second quarter that was slightly worse that what analysts had been anticipating, one possible reason for the stockâs slide on the news. The forward trajectory is all that really matters at this point, though. Sales of N95 masks and other protective gear haveÂ undoubtedly been one big driver of theÂ growth in July, with 3M on track to make twoÂ billion of the respirators this year. But other companies including Fastenal Co. and Cintas Corp. have predicted a moderation of the surge-style spikes seen in the earlier days of the pandemic in April and May as the market is now comparably better-supplied. More importantly, forÂ those seekingÂ signs of economic revival, 3M citedÂ âbroad-based sales improvements across businesses and geographies.â While this doesnât necessarily augur aÂ V-shaped recovery for the manufacturing sector, it does suggestÂ things are moving in the right direction. The cloud over any rebound for 3M is its potential liabilities related to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which have been linked to cancer and other ailments. 3M reached an agreement last week with Alabama that will see itÂ assess contamination from the so-called forever chemicals;Â invest in treatment and remediation; and research the substances impact on health and the environment â at an unspecified cost to the company. Some analysts had been expecting 3M to take another significant charge on PFAS in the second quarter and the missed opportunity to âkitchen-sinkâ what were going to be ugly numbers anyway may also be a factor in the stock reaction.Â Rockwell Automation Inc.:Â Continuing with the theme of possible green shoots of recovery, Rockwell CEO Blake Moret is confident enough in the trajectory of his companyâs recovery that he announced intentions toÂ roll back temporary pay cuts for employees by December andÂ âhopefully sooner.â Rockwell also intends to make anotherÂ ârecognition paymentâ to manufacturing workers who have continued to come in to factoriesÂ and kept its operations grinding along. While some companies have had to turn furloughs into permanent job cuts as the pandemic and associated economic slump have dragged on longer than expected, this is an important counterpoint. It speaks to a broader trend across the industrial landscape of companies prioritizingÂ labor and seeking costÂ cuts elsewhere first in recognition of the unique nature of this particular downturn and shifting expectations of the corporate worldâs duty to the community.Â Railroads CSX Corp. and Union Pacific Corp. have also said they are bringing workers off of furlough as volumes rebound. In terms of numbers, Rockwell actually increased its fiscal 2020 profit guidance for the year and now anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $7.40 to $7.60 on an organic sales decline of about 8%. This is based on an expectation that a âgradual recovery continues, with no increase in pandemic-related facility closures or disruptions to the supply chain.â Coming out of this crisis, Rockwell is set to be a key beneficiary of any significant push to bring manufacturing work back to North America.Â Raytheon Technologies Corp. :Â Whatever recovery is happening in manufacturing, it isnât showing upÂ in the world of commercial aerospace, with flight travel still at a crawl.Â Raytheon âÂ formed earlier this year from the merger of United Technologies Corp. and Raytheon Co. âÂ burned through nearly $250 million of cash in the first quarter as stable results from its defense businesses failed to offset a disastrous slump in the aerospace operations. The Collins Aerospace parts division, previously the companyâs most profitable, was barely in the green on an adjusted basis in the second quarter andÂ Raytheon took a $3.2 billion goodwill writedown on the roughly $30 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins Inc. in 2018 that helped form the unit. The charge reflects the deteriorating outlook for commercial aerospace due to the coronavirus, which no one could have predicted, but itâs worth remembering that the deal was very expensive from the start and the assumptions underpinningÂ that price tag relied on quite a lot of things breaking the companyâs way.Â The Pratt & Whitney engine segment saw sales tumble more than 30% excluding the impact of M&A and currency swings. Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes said the company had cut 8,000 positions in its commercial aerospace divisions and said some of that reduction would be permanent, a shift from the first quarter when he warned about cutting too deep. Arguably, things could have been uglier. The question now is whether the worst is truly behind the company. A slide in the earnings presentation termed âCurrent Environmentâ has big question marks next to projections for commercial air traffic and macroeconomic conditions. In case it wasnât clear what those meant, they are also colored gray, as in this is a gray area.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

The rail road company said Cindy Sanborn will succeed Wheeler as COO, effective Sept. 1. Wheeler became COO on Feb. 1, 2016, and Sanborn joins the company from fellow rail operator Union Pacific Corp. , where she was most recently vice president of network planning. Norfolk Southern's stock, which rose 1.4% in morning trading, has slipped 2.3% year to date, while the Dow Jones Transportation Average  has lost 9.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has declined 6.9%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/374c735f-ec0a-35cf-84fa-42dcd6ca20a3/norfolk-southern-coo-wheeler.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-27	2020-07-27 14:47:26	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Despite a Lousy Second Quarter, Railroad Stocks Could Be Poised for a Rebound	Given this past week's quarterly results from North America's railroad companies, it would be easy to presume the worst.  Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) reported a 24% decline in freight revenue.  Canadian Pacific Railway (NYSE: CP) seemed to fare slightly better, topping earnings estimates of 3.77 Canadian dollars per share for its second quarter.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/26d7fd2e-09b2-3502-a3c0-1f75d3798053/despite-a-lousy-second.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-07-24	2020-07-24 18:44:09	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Union Pacific Eyes Highway-To-Rail Conversion Opportunities	Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) is looking for opportunities to take more market share away from trucks, whether that means through investments or through its own service product, executives said during the company's second-quarter earnings call Thursday.&quot;I wouldn't be surprised if there are other investments we make that look more like the activity Loup does, where you're providing ancillary services from the railroad, but they are primary services to a customer. And it makes us a more valuable supplier, it makes us stickier and opens up even more markets for us,&quot; said Union Pacific (UP) President and CEO Lance Fritz during the call. Loup Logistics, a UP subsidiary, provides door-to-door intermodal shipping, transload and logistics services.For now, UP is touting its existing services and competitive pricing, pointing to recent wins in the e-commerce and parcel space. Those arrangements with business partners from those arenas boost UP's domestic and international intermodal prospects, according to Kenny Rocker, UP's senior vice president for marketing and sales.&quot;We have aligned ourselves with a number of e-commerce winners. We've been able to win business in those markets. We feel very bullish about the wins. They are coming on now. We're expecting more,&quot; Rocker said.UP's efforts come amid expectations that the trucking market will remain competitive with it into the back half of 2020, especially as intermodal shipments potentially pick up during the peak season and into the winter holidays.Â &quot;When we look at the forecast, we certainly expect that truck utilization and those rates will improve monthly well into 2021, which will put us in a better position to not only win more business but get a little bit more margin on that business,&quot; Rocker said.Expectations For Peak SeasonThe peak season traditionally has been from August to October, with retailers getting ready for back-to-school sales and stocking inventories ahead of the winter holiday season. During this time, other commodities, such as grain, also experience an increased need for transportation services.In recent years, industry stakeholders have been debating how much peak season still exists, but with the COVID-19 pandemic this year, there is a renewed focus on how much rail demand might grow in the second half of this year.Although the coronavirus pandemic and communities' responses to it could still evolve, &quot;our volumes are really increasing each week. They're pretty strong. All the dynamics show that we're going to have a pretty solid peak season. ... So it looks to me, barring any type of the second wave, that we're going to be in a really good position to have a really solid peak season,&quot; Rocker said.Operational Changes At UPThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the pace for some operational adjustments at UP, executives said.Â Those adjustments included running longer trains, which has reduced train starts and utilized fewer locomotives. They also included extending sidings to allow longer trains to run and eliminating switches and &quot;touchpoints.&quot; Around 40 projects to extend sidings to 15,000-16,000 feet are part of UP's capital investment plan.Â The outcome for customers in running trains is that it lessens network congestion, Fritz said.Â &quot;The number of trains on our network at any given time is about one-third less, which is much more than what you see in volume. And how that translates into a service product is there's less network congestion on average anywhere you look, less meets passes, et cetera,&quot; Fritz said. &quot;That allows each train more free-running time and it really makes the network a little easier to dispatch, and that translates into a service product.&quot;UP is also continuing with redesigning its operations in Chicago and Houston. Houston changes include consolidating intermodal facilities to one location and expanding switching capability and the ability to run longer trains at its Englewood Yard.As volumes began to grow again from April lows, UP has kept some of the operational adjustments it made during the pandemic. As volumes rebound even more, the railroad now expects to maintain some of those changes it made during the height of its response to the pandemic.Â &quot;There is opportunity across the board in operations still&quot; to improve UP's productivity, said Jim Vena, UP's chief operating officer. &quot;Is it as easy as walking in like I did the first day at Pine Bluff [a UP facility in Arkansas] and say we're shutting it down after I was here for two weeks? No. I don't think so. But I've got my eye on a couple of yards that need to be tuned up. And if they don't tune up, they'll be gone.&quot;But should UP need to add more assets and workforce to match network needs, it would consider doing so, according to UP CFO Jennifer Hamann.While UP doesn't expect to return assets and its workforce on a one-for-one basis, &quot;you will need to add train starts as the volume grows, and there are people associated with that. There are locomotives, there's freight cars, car hire, and you're going to burn a little more fuel,&quot; Hamann said. &quot;Our task, and what we feel very confident about, is that we will be able to do that in a more efficient way as the volumes come back, and we look forward to that because the volume is definitely the friend of a railroad.&quot;UP's net profit in the second quarter fell 28% amid a 20% decline in volumes resulting from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Second-quarter net income totaled $1.1 billion, or $1.67 per diluted share, compared with $1.6 billion, or $2.22 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2019.For more on UP's second-quarter financial results, go here.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related articles:Union Pacific's second-quarter net profit slips 28%Operational changes helped railcars move faster, says Union Pacific reportUnion Pacific shutters operation of multimodal service Cold ConnectUnknowns cloud cost savings for Union PacificSee more from Benzinga  * How The FMC Monitors 'Blank Sailings' And Their Competitive Impacts  * How Cargo Cameras Help Fleets Forecast And Meet Demand  * Carriers In Cruise Control While Wider Economy Sputters(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Revenue for UP's bulk segment slipped 17%, while revenues for UP's industrial and premium segments fell by 23% and 33%, respectively. UP's intermodal and automotive volumes are part of the premium segment.Â But UP trimmed expenses by 22% in the second quarter to $2.59 billion, with fuel expenses cut 56% to $247 million.The railroad's operating ratio was 61%, up from 59.6% in the second quarter of 2019. Some investors use operating ratio, which is a company's expenses as a percentage of its revenue, to gauge the financial health of a company. A lower operating ratio implies improved financial health.Â (Union Pacific)A number of service metrics for UP improved in the second quarter.

2020-07-23	2020-07-23 13:34:39	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	How Does Union Pacific's Debt Look Like?	Shares of Union Pacific Inc. (NYSE: UNP) moved higher by 10.31% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Union Pacific has.Union Pacific's Debt Based on Union Pacific's balance sheet as of April 23, 2020, long-term debt is at $26.36 billion and current debt is at $1.51 billion, amounting to $27.88 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.13 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $26.75 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Union Pacific's $62.22 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.45. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Debt Is Important Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Recap: Union Pacific Q2 Earnings  * Earnings Scheduled For July 23, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-06-23	2020-06-23 01:15:37	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Union Pacific Option Trader Makes $1.2M Bet On 5% Downside	Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) shares are up 43.1% in the past three months. The railroad giant appears to be chugging along thanks to optimism that the U.S. economy is on the track to a full recovery in the long-term. However, one large option trader on Monday morning made a big bet that the Union Pacific rally will soon be derailed.The Union Pacific TradeOn Monday morning, Benzinga Pro subscribers received an option alert related to an unusually large Union Pacific trade:  * At 10:06 a.m., a trader purchased 2,000 Union Pacific put options with a $165 strike price expiring on July 17 at the ask price of $6.151. The trade represented a more than $1.23 million bearish bet.Why It's ImportantEven traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader.Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock.Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there's no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively large size of Monday's Union Pacific option trade, it could certainly be institutional hedging.Union Pacific's COVID-19 ReboundUnion Pacific shares traded slightly higher on Monday without any major news from the company.Last week, Deutsche Bank analyst Amit Mehrotra said he is bullish on transportation stocks given freight capacity demand bottomed in late April and is now on a &quot;slow-and-steady recovery path.&quot; Despite concerns over a potential second wave of COVID-19 infections, Mehrotra reiterated his Buy rating for Union Pacific and raised his price target from $170 to $171.Other analysts, such as CFRA's Colin Scarola, have said Union Pacific's large rally off the March bottom has the stock fully valued given its near-term earnings outlook. Scarola is projecting $7.71 in EPS in 2020 and $8.63 in EPS in 2021, just 2.9% higher than 2019 earnings.

The large option trader may be betting that a second coronavirus wave derails the market in the next month, that Union Pacific disappoints the market with a rough earnings report or simply that traders will take profits in the stock prior to or immediately after earnings as part of a sell-the-news event.Regardless of the bearish thesis, the break-even price of the puts is $158.85, suggesting 5.4% downside for Union Pacific shares over the next month.Do you agree with this take?

2020-06-16	2020-06-16 21:13:58	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Class 1 Railroads To Retain Cost-Cutting Measures	The Class I railroads are considering retaining some of the measures they implemented to scale down operations as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to comments some executives have made at recent industry conferences.&quot;I'm very confident that as we do add back resources, we will not add them back on a one-to-one basis,&quot; said Canadian National RailwayÂ (NYSE: CNI) Chief Financial Officer Ghislain Houle at the Deutsche Bank 11th Annual Virtual Global Industrials & Materials Summit on June 9.Houle was explaining how CN would call back furloughed employees as the North American economy rebounds and demand for rail capacity grows. Given the uncertainties of how the economy and certain sectors, such as the automotive sector, might recover, CN would be &quot;patient&quot; in bringing people back from furlough, Houle said.Union PacificÂ Corporation (NYSE: UNP) Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Hamann made similar remarks recently.&quot;As the volumes come back, we don't expect that costs will come back at a one for one,&quot; Hamann said at the UBS Virtual Global Industrials & Transportation Conference on June 2.Some of the structural changes that Union Pacific (UP) made include rerouting some of UP's train plans so that trains aren't starting and stopping at certain terminals, Hamann said. This has improved UP's locomotive productivity, according to Hamann.Â UP is also continuing to invest in sidings, which will enable longer trains, she said, in addition to examining how to create efficiencies at its local nodes on a terminal-by-terminal basis.&quot;As volumes come back, ... can we just build those volumes into the existing train network, into the existing trains we're running, and build that train length?&quot; Hamann said.The company also hopes to finalize the consolidation of its intermodal terminals in Chicago in the latter part of 2020, and it is looking at similar consolidation opportunities at the intermodal terminals in Houston and Los Angeles, Hamann said at the Deutsche Bank conference.The idea of making some cost cuts permanent isn't new. In April, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) executives said during their first-quarter earnings call that they could make some cuts permanent.The railroad removed excess locomotives and reduced crew starts, with expectations to cut crew starts even further, executives said. Norfolk Southern (NS) is also examining which terminals and rail yards to close, including outlying smaller yards that &quot;we can continue to live without,&quot; FreightWaves reported NS Chief Operating Officer Mike Wheeler as saying.Â Â Â Â The railroads have also said in recent weeks that the pandemic has caused companies to focus on cutting costs in a way that addresses operational efficiency. For instance, Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU) said during its first-quarter earnings call in April that it had used the pandemic to implement precision scheduled railroading (PSR)Â  in a more traditional manner, resulting in fewer train starts, which in turn pares down the number of crew members needed.Kansas City Southern (KCS) has &quot;pivoted from a customized PSR model that we built for revenue ... to the traditional, old-fashioned part of PSR ... of eliminating costs and eliminating trains and reducing train starts and the like. [But] that does not mean we're neglecting service,&quot; said Sameh Fahmy, executive vice president of PSR, during the company's first-quarter earnings call in April.But as the railroads consider keeping some of the operational efficiencies they've made as a result of pandemic-related cost reductions, they will also have to ensure that their certified train and engine crews will be able to return quickly should rail demand surge. They will need to have locomotive and railcar fleets stored at strategically located terminals to respond to any demand upticks as well.A number of railroads have said they've stored locomotives and railcars in locations where they can be easily retrieved should capacity demand rev up quickly.(Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh)Photo by Brett Sayles from Pexels.See more from Benzinga  * Commentary: Is Just-In-Time Past Its Time?  * Major Layoffs Strike A Blow To Volvo â Midday Market  * Reefer Rejections Fall As Ontario Booms(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-06-11	2020-06-11 14:07:10	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Have Rail Volumes Bottomed Out?	Rail volumes could rebound in the second half of the year, but the pace of a rebound will depend largely on consumer confidence, executives from several Class I railroads cautioned at recent investor conferences.There is still little visibility &quot;in terms of how the consumer is going to reengage,&quot; said Jennifer Hamann, chief financial officer for Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) at a conference sponsored by investment firm Deutsche Bank on Tuesday. Hamann also spoke at an investor conference sponsored by investment firm UBS on June 2.Although international intermodal volumes have fallen by about 16% quarter-to-date amid canceled vessel sailings to U.S. West Coast ports, the railroad is &quot;feeling just a tad more optimistic&quot; amid expectations that volumes might have bottomed out in April and May, Hamann said on June 2.However, &quot;it's hard to call the bottom&quot; because it's hard to gauge how U.S. consumers will respond to the easing of shelter-in-place mandates, and so &quot;a lot of question marks out there still need to be answered,&quot; she said at UBS.Commodity categories more exposed to consumer activity include motor vehicles and parts as well as lumber. If housing starts rise, then Union Pacific (UP) might see demand growth for centerbeam cars. Plastics and soda ash are other types of materials down the supply chain that might also see growth if the automotive and housing sectors see increased consumer activity.&quot;Certainly there's a hesitancy ... with making those big kinds of purchases,&quot; Hamann said at the Deutsche Bank conference.Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE: CP) Chief Financial Officer Nadeem Velani echoed Hamann's sentiments at the UBS conference.It will be interesting to see what the economy is going to look like and how consumer confidence will take shape three to six months from now, Velani said.Â Velani estimates that June volumes will be &quot;less bad&quot; than May volumes and third-quarter volumes higher than second-quarter volumes, even though third-quarter volumes will still likely be lower than the same period in 2019.CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: CSX) CEO Jim Foote thinks rail volumes are &quot;inching up week after week&quot; as May has moved into June, and even though the increases are slight, &quot;the trend line is promising,&quot; he said at the Deutsche Bank conference.Â &quot;I think overall, I'm comfortable, but you have to look at it from a realistic standpoint. In many of our markets...we're seeing sequentially we see improvement. We still have business segments like auto that are down in the 80%-some range on a year-over-year basis,&quot; Foote said. &quot;So, we have a ways to go, but I'm more confident today clearly than I was a month ago.&quot;North American rail volumes up sequentially week-over-weekRail volume figures from the Association of American Railroads showed totals increasing from last week to this week.North American weekly rail traffic totaled 598,301 carloads and intermodal units for the week that ended Saturday, a 15.4% decrease from the same period in 2019 but a 7.2% increase from the week ending May 30.Year-to-date North American volumes totaled 14.3 million carloads and intermodal units, which is 11.7% lower than the same period a year ago.Meanwhile, U.S. weekly rail volumes totaled 433,171 carloads and intermodal units, a 16.5% decrease from the same period in 2019 but 9.5% higher than the week ending May 30.Year-to-date U.S. rail traffic totaled 10.3 million carloads and intermodal units, a 13.1% decline from the same period last year.U.S. rail volumes over the past year.

Hamann also said Tuesday that operating ratio for the quarter is not expected to improve. For 2020, the company said it expects to maintain its dividend. The stock fell 1.3% in morning trading, but outperformed the Dow Jones Transportation Average , which fell 2.8%.

2020-06-05	2020-06-05 19:20:20	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Operational Changes Helped Railcars Move Faster, Says Union Pacific Report	Converting more hump yards to flat switching has reduced the time a railcar is at a rail yard, Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) said in its 2019 sustainability report released May 28.Union Pacific (UP) uses hump yards to sort railcars in such a way that blocks of cars are consolidated based on common destinations, the report said. Flat switching results in the same outcome but maintenance costs are much less, according to UP.&quot;Each time a car touches a [hump] yard, it adds about 24 hours to its journey. The key to an efficient network is ensuring cars stop only when and where they need to. When a hump yard's inbound traffic is reduced, it becomes more cost-effective for the yard to flat switch,&quot; UP said.Â To convert a hump yard to flat switching, inbound cars bypass the hump and a switch crew sorts the cars. Modeling software simulates the transportation plan changes and provides visuals on how many additional cars flow into a terminal and how long the trains will be that come out of those terminals, UP said. The software also helps the rail workers understand impacts on mileage, transit time and train starts.Â UP has converted hump yards to flat switching at Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Proviso, Illinois; and Hinkle, Oregon. The railroad also stopped humping cars in Kansas City, Kansas, and Fort Worth, Texas.Â The changes are part of UP's wider plan to deploy Unified Plan 2020, the railroad's version of precision scheduled railroading, an operating model aimed at streamline operations. UP describes the change as shifting its focus of operations from moving trains to moving cars, which in turn helps to increase car velocity, minimize car dwell and use or improve the utilization of train crews and assets, according to the railroad. UP also says it aims to increase train size, which in turn would enable the railroad to use less fuel and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions.Projects to add capacityUP's capital investments program in 2019 totaled $3.2 billion. One of the projects last year entailed constructing five new siding extensions on the Sunset Route between Los Angeles and points in Arizona and New Mexico. The extensions, averaging 7,000-7,500 feet in length, will help UP accommodate longer trains, UP said.Â Although UP didn't acquire any new locomotives in 2019 and doesn't plan to purchase any in 2020, it is modernizing its existing fleet, with nearly 350 high- and low-horsepower locomotives overhauled and rebuilt to meet more stringent emissions standards, UP said.Â Meanwhile, a yard modernization at the Los Angeles Transportation Center Intermodal Facility is also supposed to be finished in the fall of 2020. The multi-million dollar updates include the reconfiguration of thousands of feet of track, which UP says will improve fluidity and capacity and ultimately enable customers to pick up containers faster.UP is involved in two new logistics parks in Texas, the RCR Hempstead Logistics Park, which opened in northwest Houston in February of this year, and the Maverick Industrial Park in Eagle Pass. The railroad also has a partnership with Iowa Northern Railway, Valor Victoria and Watco. It launched intermodal service last December 2019 at the Butler Intermodal Terminal in Shell Rock, Iowa.Â UP spent approximately $70 million to restore railroad tracks and bridges in Nebraska that were damaged as a result of historic flooding, as well as restore tracks and assets harmed by flooding in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.Â Â See more from Benzinga  * Companies Channel Spirit Of 'Coopetition' For Blockchain Success  * Update: Trucking Employment Lags Broader Increase In U.S. Economy  * US-Mexico Truck Crossings Decline 22% At Port Laredo In April(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-05-27	2020-05-27 21:28:02	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	US Rail Volumes Rise On A Week-To-Week Basis	Although U.S. rail traffic is still sharply lower compared with the same period in 2019, rail volumes for intermodal and commodities such as motor vehicles and grain are higher sequentially on a weekly basis, according to the Association of American Railroads (AAR).U.S. grain volumes totaled 21,977 carloads for the week that ended Saturday, which is a 2.3% decrease compared with the same period in 2019 but 5.7% higher than 20,790 carloads for the week ending May 16. Meanwhile, weekly carloads for motor vehicles and parts were up 70.1% on a sequential basis to 4,874 carloads (but down 71.4% year-over-year), while weekly intermodal volumes rose 2.8% to 238,076 intermodal units (down 11.2% year-over-year).U.S. carloads for grain, motor vehicles and parts and forest products (SONAR: RTOMV.USA, RTOGM.USA, RTOPF.USA)Meanwhile, total weekly U.S. carloads rose 3.4% sequentially, although they're 27.5% lower year-over-year.&quot;Of the 20 carload categories we track, 15 had modestly higher loadings last week than the week before, led by motor vehicles and grain. Meanwhile, intermodal originations were higher last week than in any of the previous 11 weeks. While we can't yet say whether rail traffic and, by extension, the economy, have turned a corner, these are all encouraging signs,&quot; said AAR Senior Vice President John T. Gray.Â He continued, &quot;As areas across the country begin to reopen over the next several weeks, perhaps we can start looking for light at the end of what has become a rather long tunnel. Whatever the outcome, railroads will do their part to get us out of the tunnel safely and reliably.&quot;On a year-to-date basis, U.S. rail traffic totaled 9.5 million carloads and intermodal units, down 12.8% from the same period in 2019, while North American rail volumes totaled 13.1 million carloads and intermodal units, which is 11.4% lower than the same period a year ago.U.S. carloads and intermodal units over the past year. (SONAR: RTOTC.USA, RTOIT.CLASSI, RTOIC.CLASSI)UP eyes opportunities in intermodal, grainAt a virtual investor conference on Wednesday hosted by investment firm Bernstein, Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) CEO Lance Fritz echoed AAR's observations about rising carloads for motor vehicles and grain products.Phase one of the trade deal between the U.S. and China has helped China get back into the export market, resulting in higher grain volumes for wheat and soybeans in particular, Fritz said.Fritz described how to look at economic growth and opportunities to increase rail volumes over the next year or two by focusing on three segments: trade, industrial production and consumer activity. The trade segment shows promise if the trade deal so far between the U.S. and China is allowed to mature even as a global recession remains a potential headwind. Meanwhile, U.S. and North American industrial production is &quot;well positioned&quot; to take advantage of global demand even as some customers consider onshoring or nearshoring opportunities in the long-term, Fritz said.But consumer confidence and activity are harder to pinpoint because of the wide range in consumers' responses to reopening businesses during and after the coronavirus pandemic, Fritz said. However, the housing market &quot;hasn't completely cratered&quot; and automobile plants are starting to open up, which could bode well for rail volumes.&quot;It's a pretty balanced mix in terms of what I see with headwinds and tailwinds,&quot; Fritz said.Â How Union Pacific (UP) benefits from onshoring or nearshoring will depend on where companies build their facilities, Fritz said. If the facilities fall on UP's franchise, then UP can compete for inbound or outbound business. If facilities land in Mexico or Canada, &quot;it gets a little more tenuous but it depends on the books&quot; or customers' supply chain needs, he said. But facilities near ports might prove more challenging because UP will have to compete with alternative rail carriers, other coastal ports and transloaders, Fritz said.Nonetheless, in the near term, improved, truck-like service as a result of precision scheduled railroading is helping UP see new opportunities for intermodal, such as in e-commerce and through partnerships to put domestic intermodal ramps in new locations, Fritz said.To counter an anticipated 25% drop in rail volumes for the second quarter, UP has taken measures such as furloughing employees in the engineering, mechanical, and train and engine divisions, asking managing staff to go unpaid for one week on a monthly basis and reducing executive pay by 25%, Fritz said. UP has also temporarily closed its Jenks facility in Arkansas, its DeSoto facility in Missouri and an engineering shop in Denver.See more from Benzinga  * E-commerce Drives Multi-Pronged Expansion At UPS Airlines  * Beef And chicken inventories Surge In April  * Weekly Fuel Report: May 25, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-04-01	2020-04-01 13:34:44	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Union Pacific, CSX Warn Of Coronavirus' Potential Impacts On Financial Returns	Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: CSX) said the coronavirus pandemic is creating huge uncertainties that could translate into &quot;material&quot; financial impacts on the companies' financial results, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Union Pacific's financial outlook for 2020, which the company gave earlier this year, doesn't include the potential impact of COVID-19, according to UP's March 31 filing to the SEC. Union PacificÂ  will disclose its first quarter 2020 financial results on April 23.&quot;The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's 2020 financial and operating results, which may be material, is highly uncertain and depends on numerous factors including but not limited to the impact of federal, state and local government regulations; the effect of the pandemic's economic impact on demand for the company's services; and potential disruption to global supply chains,&quot; Union Pacific said in its filing.Â Union Pacific had said during its fourth-quarter 2019 earnings call in January that it was striving to reach an operating ratio below 60% in 2020. Operating ratio (OR), which is calculated by dividing operating expenses by revenue, can be a measure of a company's financial health, with a lower OR implying improving profitability.Â The railroad serves the U.S. West Coast ports, which were hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak that started in China earlier this year amid an increase in canceled sailings. While Chinese manufacturing has started to return to normal, according to reports, canceled sailings could occur again because of the pandemic's impact on North American demand.Eastern U.S. rail carrier CSX also told the SEC that the coronavirus pandemic could affect CSX's financial results, although the magnitude of the impact is hard to predict.&quot;The ultimate magnitude of COVID-19, including the extent of its impact on the company's financial and operating results, which could be material, will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues, its effect on the demand for the company's transportation services and the supply chain, as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic,&quot; CSX said in a March 26 filing to the SEC. CSX said it was providing an update on CSX's response to the pandemic in connection with a previously announced registered offering of senior notes.&quot;Public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions, the promotion of social distancing and the adoption of work-from-home and online learning by companies and institutions, could adversely affect demand for the commodities and products that the company transports, including import and export volume,&quot; CSX said. &quot;In addition, COVID-19 and the related initiatives may result in supply chain disruption, which could have an adverse impact on volumes and make it more difficult for the company to serve its customers.&quot;Â CSX continued, &quot;The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information, which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness.&quot;CSX also said its initial financial outlook for 2020 given in January doesn't reflect the potential impacts of the coronavirus. The company had said in January that it expected 2020 revenue to be flat to 2% lower from 2019.Â CSX will announce its first-quarter 2020 results on April 22.Photo: Flickr/Chu Shau-LuenSee more from Benzinga  * Maritime History Notes: America's Hospital Ships  * Commentary: April Fools!

The initiative is a partnership between global environmental nonprofit CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature, with collaboration from the We Mean Business Coalition. A total of 839 companies globally have signed on to the initiative, which assesses corporate emissions reduction targets to ensure their participation in meeting Paris Agreement goals.CSX, which announced its involvement with the initiative on March 18 and joined the initiative in January, said it aims to reduce GHG emissions intensity by 37.3% between 2014 and 2030 through investments in technologies and operational practices. CSX said that in 2018, it achieved its 2020 goal of reducing emissions intensity by 6%-8%.&quot;Reducing emissions is important to CSX and its customers. Rail is already the most fuel-efficient mode of freight transportation, and CSX further delivers by continuing to set fuel efficiency records,&quot; CSX said. &quot;CSX is the only U.S. class I railroad to have crossed the threshold of operating below one gallon of fuel-per-thousand gross ton miles, and the company is pursuing opportunities for additional improvement as part of its commitment to sustainable business practices.&quot;Union Pacific (UP) said last week it submitted a commitment letter to the initiative. It will use the initiative's sectoral decarbonization approach transport tool, which models targets for direct and indirect transportation emissions.Â Â &quot;As one of the nation's largest freight railroads, it is our responsibility to act as environmental stewards, reducing emissions and enabling sustainable economic growth across our supply chain,&quot; said UP CEO Lance Fritz. &quot;This is a challenging task as it means examining every aspect of our operation and looking for innovative solutions while continuing to create long-term value for our shareholders, customers, employees and the communities where we operate.&quot;Canadian National joined the initiative in June 2017. It set a target of reducing GHG emissions per metric ton kilometer by 29% by 2030 with 2015 as a base year.See more from Benzinga  * Commentary: Coronavirus Sickens US Economy, Could Kill Container Volumes  * Cargojet Shifts Aircraft To Handle Domestic Surge In Essential Supplies  * Trump Administration Continues To Target Iranian Oil(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

We are focused most acutely on mission-critical functions,including transportation planning and operations, customer service, equipment management, train reporting and work orders, ensuring we have plans in place to maintain adequate staffing and a safe, effective work environment,"" Norfolk Southern (NS) chief marketing officer Alan Shaw said in a March 12 operations note.Those measures include ensuring that all workplaces are stocked with cleaning and disinfecting products, modifying work areas to allow for additional spatial separation and tasking NS's chief medical officer to monitor guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).NS is also preparing its employees, systems and communication infrastructure to work remotely when applicable and should the need arise, the company said. The railroad has formed a Pandemic Planning Task Force consisting of representatives of all departments to review internal work group contingency plans and procedures.The eastern U.S. railroad also urged customers to notify it of any changes or disruptions to their supply chains or operations.""Should the need arise, we are preparing to activate our Command Center, staffed by all areas essential to train operations. I commit to you that we will make certain we communicate all changes to you, our customers and supply chain partners, as we move forward,"" Shaw said. ""In turn, we encourage you to advise us with respect to anticipated changes in your supply chains so that we can continue to evaluate and, if necessary, modify our operating plans accordingly to meet your service expectations.""Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) said in a March 6 customer update that it has been actively monitoring the situation, and it is following CDC guidelines for businesses. The western U.S. railroad developed a cross-departmental pandemic team in 2006 that developed business continuity plans.Â Union Pacific (UP) has put into place a pandemic operating plan that includes a Command Center to ensure continued train operations. The team at the center is responsible for transportation plan adjustments, traffic diversions and equipment planning, and it will ensure communication protocols between customers and operating and support staff, said Kenny Rocker, UP's executive vice president for marketing and sales.UP also asked customers to alert the railroad should any changes occur to customers' supply chains.""If you are expecting an increase of product imported from China or from a secondary source, such as local suppliers, we would like to keep in close contact as you gain clarity on when your volumes are expected to pick up again. If you are able to let us know the timing and quantity of those anticipated volume levels, we will do our part to be ready to handle the volume when it arrives,"" Rocker said. ""The more we can understand what your forecasted shipments might look like and when they will happen, the better we can help provide the transportation solutions you need to keep your supply chain running smoothly.""Image Sourced from PixabaySee more from Benzinga  * FMC Monitors Coronavirus Impacts On Container Industry's Competitive Health  * How Feasible Are Drones For Last-Mile Delivery From A Regulatory Perspective?  * Cenovus Energy To Suspend Crude-By-Rail Program In 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-03-09	2020-03-09 11:00:45	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Xerox Plans to Expand Slate of HP Board Nominees to 12	(Bloomberg) -- Xerox Holdings Corp. plans to expand its slate of nominees to replace the board of HP Inc. to 12 directors with the addition of former Alliant Energy Corp. Chief Executive Officer Erroll B. Davis Jr., according to people familiar with the matter.His nomination is expected to come as early as Monday, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Davis has served on the boards of several high-profile companies, including Union Pacific Corp., General Motors Co., PPG Industries Inc. and BP Plc.Representatives for Xerox and HP declined to comment. HP had previously said it believed Xeroxâs nominations are a âself-serving tactic by Xerox to advance its proposal, that significantly undervalues HP and creates meaningful risk to the detriment of HP shareholders.âThe move comes as Xerox and HP executives are expected to meet this week to discuss HPâs ongoing concerns about the tie-up between the companies.Davisâs nomination follows a decision by HP to temporarily expand its board to 13 members with the addition of NXP Semiconductors NV CEO Richard Clemmer last month. Former HP CEO Dion Weisler has already said he plans to step down as a director after the annual meeting, which will shrink the board size to 12 members at that time, HP said.At the time of Clemmerâs appointment to the board on Feb. 27, HP said it would give 10 days to Xerox to nominate an additional director.With the addition of Davis, Xerox continues to push to replace the entire board of HP in order to help facilitate a merger between the companies. Concurrently, Xerox officially launched a tender offer to acquire HP last week after the personal computer giant continued to rebuff its efforts for a tie-up.Xerox is offering $24 a share in cash and stock -- or roughly $35 billion -- to acquire HP. The photocopying pioneer has said combining would yield $2 billion in cost savings and more than $1 billion in additional revenue growth. Activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns an 11% stake in Xerox and a 4.4% stake in HP, has also been advocating for a merger between the two companies.HPâs board has rejected Xeroxâs offer, arguing it undervalues the Palo Alto, California-based company. HP announced last month it will return $16 billion to shareholders as part of a standalone plan.Xerox said in a regulatory filing that executives for both companies, including Xerox CEO John Visentin and HP CEO Enrique Lores, spoke by telephone on March 3. Lores said he would like to arrange an in-person meeting to have an an âin depth conversationâ about the three concerns HP has about a tie-up, namely the value exchange, capital structure and synergies, Xerox said in the filing.âVisentin responded that Xerox had already made an offer to combine the companies that Xerox believes HP stockholders support, and had no intention of deviating from the course and timeline of the offer, but added that Xerox would be willing to meet and listen if HP has an offer or proposal that it believes addresses their concerns and creates value for Xerox shareholders,â according to the filing.Xerox said the parties planned to schedule a meeting for this week.To contact the reporter on this story: Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Matthew Monks, Elizabeth FournierFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xerox-plans-expand-slate-hp-110045724.html?.tsrc=rss

The company disclosed in a presentation for an industrial conference that expects fourth-quarter volumes to decline about 11% from a year ago.

The company said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to be down a &quot;similar&quot; but &quot;slightly less&quot; percentage as volumes, while the current FactSet revenue consensus of $5.38 billion implies a 6.6% decline.

Hudbay didnât immediately comment.The Union Pacific notice to customers will likely hurt copper and steel shipments from the U.S., Anton Posner, the chief executive officer of supply-chain management and consulting company Mercury Resources, said in an interview. Aluminum deliveries from Quebec into the U.S. will likely be delayed, he said.âThis should have an impact, but weâre not sure how much right now,â Posner said Thursday by telephone. âItâs kind of like when youâre trying to fly from Houston and the pilot comes on while sitting on the tarmac that youâre in a ground stop because LaGuardia is too congested.âAbout 3,200 workers at CN Railway went on strike Tuesday over issues including working conditions and medical benefits, the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference union said. Shares of the company fell for a fourth day, taking this weekâs loss to 3.2% in Toronto as of Thursday.CN Railway serves all nine smelters in Canada, according to the companyâs annual report. It also said it has a network of 16 metals distribution centers and the largest active fleet of railcars for metals in the country.Teck Resources Ltd. said in its 2018 annual report that its Cardinal River operations in Alberta are served by Canadian National Railway, which transports its products to ports on the west coast. The Vancouver-based company mines steelmaking coal in Cardinal River.âWe have been monitoring the situation closely, assessing potential impacts and implementing mitigation strategies,â Teck spokesman Chris Stannell said in an emailed statement, without providing details. âAny stoppage of rail service is negative for the Canadian economy as a whole. It negatively affects shippers both in terms of business and international reputation with customers.âHamilton, Ontario-based Stelco Holdings Inc. Chairman Alan Kestenbaum said his company hasnât been impacted by the strike.âWe have our own rail cars and have various alternatives including using barge, ship, truck and alternative rail line,â he said in a text message.Alcoa Corp. spokesman Jim Beck said âthereâs no current impact on shipments from the smelters we operate, but weâre closely monitoring the situation.â The largest U.S. aluminum producer runs smelters at Baie-Comeau, Becancour and Deschambault in Canada.&#92;--With assistance from Joe Richter.To contact the reporters on this story: Joe Deaux in New York at jdeaux@bloomberg.net;Aoyon Ashraf in Toronto at aashraf7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Luzi Ann Javier at ljavier@bloomberg.net, Steven FrankFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canadian-railway-strike-disrupts-steel-200200232.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-17	2019-10-17 20:03:56	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	5 Top Stock Trades for Friday: MS, FB, HON, GOGO, UNP	A reported Brexit deal sent stocks higher in morning trade, although equities had trouble maintaining those gains throughout the session. Let's look at a few top stock trades for Friday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Morgan Stanley (MS) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) popped on earnings but is struggling to hold onto its early gains. Now over all of its major moving averages, MS stock looks better than it has all month.However, it still remains range-bound between $39.50 and $45.50. Until it can push through resistance, it may remain stuck in this range.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Facebook (FB)Despite a continual flow of negative news and headlines, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock continues to hold up.  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever It's above all of its major moving averages, as well as downtrend resistance (blue line). Now running into its 78.6% retracement and a recent level of resistance near $190, it will be vital for bulls to push it through this mark.If it can, look for a rally above last month's high at $193.10, and then above $195. In this event, look for $190 to act as support on a pullback. If resistance holds steady, look to see if the 50-day moving average can buoy FB on a pullback. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Honeywell (HON)Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is advancing on earnings, but is struggling to push through its downtrend (purple line) and the 100-day moving average. If it can do that, it puts the $172.50 mark on the table, with the $177.58 highs above that.On the downside, look to see if the 50-day moving average can act as support. Below it puts a test of the 200-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line) in the cards. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Gogo (GOGO)A look at Gogo's (NYSE:GOGO) daily chart above shows the company has secured a higher low, which is now connected by a blue trend line on the chart above. I want to see shares push through $6, putting $7-plus on the table.As you can also see, momentum is starting to turn in bulls' favor via the MACD reading (blue circle). If $6 acts as resistance, bulls need to see the 50-day act as support.On the weekly chart above, traders can see the stock coiling below $6 and the 100-week moving average. Above them opens the door to the recent high at $7.23. Above that and $8 is possible. On a longer timeframe, the 50-week moving average is a must-hold mark.Gogo has been an excellent trade for us lately, although it is a speculative play. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Union Pacific (UNP)Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is rallying on earnings, but it's running into some headwinds. Shares are being stymied by the 200-day and 100-day moving averages. It's also hitting channel resistance (blue line).However, not all hope is lost for the bulls. On the move, UNP reclaimed its 50-day moving average. It also held the 61.8% retracement. If shares can stay above these two marks, then bulls may look for it to push through resistance.Below the 61.8% and UNP starts to lose some of the little appeal that it has. A fall below this mark could usher in $157.50 or lower and even drop the stock into the low $150's.The charts are messy for this one. Over the 61.8% is good, but over the 100-day moving average is far better. Some may prefer to wait for a clean breakout over $170, putting $178-plus on the table.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

The railroad company said the reduced workforce was a result of &quot;strong productivity initiatives&quot; and lower volumes. Union Pacific's stock was up 1.4% in midday trading, although Union Pacific reported a third-quarter profit and revenue that missed expectation, according to FactSet data, as revenue in all of its business segments declined.

2019-10-17	2019-10-17 13:52:44	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Factory Slump Is Flyover Country at Honeywell	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Honeywell International Inc.âs aerospace halo is worth its weight in jet fuel.The $120 billion conglomerateÂ reported its third-quarter results on Thursday, and while there was evidence of the slowdown gripping the rest of the manufacturing industry, there was also proof that everything thatâs made Honeywell an industrialÂ  darling of Wall Street this past year still holds true. On the one hand, Honeywell cut its 2019 sales outlook. Revenue at itsÂ safety and productivity unit slumped 8% in the third quarter,Â excluding the impact of currency swings and M&A, as inventory piled up and projects got pushed out. Offsetting that bleak result was Honeywellâs aerospace division, which delivered robust 10% organic revenue growth. And HoneywellÂ raised its 2019 earnings forecast.So in the end, what could have been an ugly earnings day for Honeywell ended up eliciting a polite clap. As trading beganÂ in New York, the stock was up about 1%.For Honeywell and other industrial companies, aerospace has been a rare bright spot at a time when many other sectors, particularly automotive, electronics and increasingly construction-related businesses, are slowing down. The decline appears to be accelerating: railroad Union Pacific Corp. on Thursday reported an 8% slump in carload volumes in the third quarter while construction-rental equipment company United Rentals Inc. trimmed its revenue guidance late Wednesday. Meanwhile, a report from the Federal Reserve on Thursday showed that U.S. factory output declined in September by the most in five months as a strike at General Motors Co., the trade war and generally sluggish demand weighed on production.The sustainability of the years-long aerospace boom has come into question as a wobbling Chinese economy and the prolonged trade war risk damping demand for travel. Global passenger traffic grew 3.8% in August, well off the pace of the past few years, according to the International Air Transport Association. But thatâs still growth, at least for now. Parts makers like Honeywell are also seeing more demand for services on older aircraft while the Boeing Co. 737 Max remains grounded.In its earnings presentation, Honeywell said it expects further growth in commercial flight hours and the rollout of new jet programs to continue to boost sales at the aerospace division in 2020. Margins may get squeezed,Â because the businessÂ will tilt more heavily toward the less profitable work of installing new equipment versus maintaining older versions.The generally upbeatÂ aerospace narrative contrasts with downbeat performances elsewhere at the company. The sales decline at the safety and productivity unit was the worst for the business since 2016, when the manufacturing sector was emerging from a mini-recession sparked by the plunge in oil prices. Margins in the safety and productivity business fell 320 basis points to 13.4%. Honeywell still recorded healthy growth in its chemicals and materials unit and building-technologies division, but the pace slackened from the second quarter. Honeywell now expects total company organic sales to grow at best 5% this year, down from an earlier projection of as much as 6%.Amid what it deemed an âuncertain macro environment,â Honeywell reiterated its ability to protect its earnings through a downturn by continuing to cut costs and using its ample balance sheet for M&A and share buybacks. CEO Darius Adamczyk has largely sat comfortably on the M&A sidelines the past few years, holding out for lower valuations that may now be coming. There had been some concern when he took over fromÂ former leader Dave Cote and talked passionately about accelerating Honeywellâs revenue growth that such an effort would come at the expense of the companyâs almost religious commitment to margin improvements. That concern was ill-founded. Honeywell boosted its margin guidance for the full year in part because of the benefits of previously funded restructuring, operating improvements and the spinoffs of the less profitable Garrett Motion Inc. turbocharger and Resideo Technologies Inc. consumer-facing home products businesses last year.Honeywell is making a good case for why itâs a decent place to hide in the event of aÂ manufacturingÂ slowdown, or perhaps broaderÂ recession. But the fact that itâs making thisÂ argumentÂ increasingly loudly should be a warning for the rest of the industrial sector.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2019-10-16	2019-10-16 22:02:02	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	A Railroad's Earnings Win Isn't an All-Clear	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- CSX Corp.âs results were better than many feared they would be, but they came at the expense of several hundred jobs.The railroad on Wednesday said third-quarter revenue declined 5% as the the uncertainty wrought by the trade war and a slump in coal shipments weighed on cargo volumes. Even so, CSXâs earnings per share for the period beat analystsâ estimates and itsÂ operating ratio â a measure of profitability in which a lower number is better â fell to 56.8%, compared with 58.7% a year earlier and 57.4% in the second quarter. That reflected in part a $145 million decline in expenses from a drop in fuel prices and operating costs, as well as the reducedÂ headcount.CSX has been aggressively trying to improve its efficiency via the sometimes controversial methodology of âprecision scheduled railroading,â which is designed to reduce the amountÂ of cars, manpower and capital needed to run a railroad. This cost-cutting push has become more important as the macroeconomic backdrop has weakened. Overall volume fell 5% in the third quarter at CSX, led by slumps in cargo-container and coal traffic. Shipments of metals, chemicals and cars also declined. The company reiterated its expectation for sales to decrease as much as 2% in 2019, a sign that the guidance cut it announced in July wasnât the cautious approach management billed it as but an accurate assessment of a gloomier reality. Along those lines, United Rentals Inc. on WednesdayÂ the high end ofÂ its revenue guidance for the year, with CEO Matthew Flannery noting that âlingering economic uncertainty could impact construction and industrial activity.âThe ways in which industrial companies respond to the deepening slowdown in manufacturing sectors can beÂ  politically fraught, particularly when it comes to job cuts. CSX had 21,158 employees at the end of the third quarter, according to the companyâs estimates. Thatâs down about 380 from June and down more than 5,000 from the count at the end of 2016, before activist investor Mantle Ridge LP recruited efficiency champion Hunter Harrison to push a more rigorous cost-management strategy at the company. Harrison died later that year and his protege, Jim Foote, took over as CEO.West Coast railroad Union Pacific Corp. is implementing its own version of this efficiency push and will report earnings on Thursday morning. Itâs likely toÂ reveal a similar dynamic of slumping sales being offset by cost and job cuts. Fox 4 Kansas City, citing labor union officials, reported on Wednesday that Union Pacific is laying off 200 people â with just two days notice â as it closes down the local Neff Yard. Union Pacific said some of the workers will be able to be reassigned to operations in other areas.At a time when striking General Motors Co. workers have shut down the companyâs 34 U.S. plants for more than a month over demands for better job security and garnered support from leading Democratic candidates for president, itâs fair to wonder whether railroads and other industrial companies may face blowback of their own.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

The stock gained 0.4% in morning trading Wednesday, after falling 1.6% on Tuesday. Chief Financial Officer Robert Knight said at the Cowen and Company Global Transportation Conference, according to a transcript provided by FactSet, that after weaker-than-expected third-quarter volumes, &quot;our thinking is that volume for the second half will now be down mid-single digits versus 2018.&quot; In July, Knight had said that his &quot;best thinking at this point&quot; is that second-half volume will be down around 2% or so versus 2018. Knight said Wednesday, however, that he remained confident that &quot;the dollars we yield from our pricing initiatives will again well exceed our rail inflation costs in 2019.&quot; As a result, with margins expected to improve in the second half of the year, Knight said previous guidance of a &quot;sub-61% operating ratio&quot; in 2019 remains intact.

The stock has been in decline as economic and trade-related worries continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Recent quarterly results aren't helping matters and all said, CSX stock is now down 20% from its highs.Source: Shutterstock Is it enough to draw in investors, or is the start of a nasty bear market in this rail stock?If the charts are any indication, more pain may be on the way. There is some hope left for bulls, if support can buoy the name. Or if we get some positive fundamentals news for the stock. But as it stands, the technicals are struggling.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLet's look at a few charts and see where CSX stock could be heading. Trading CSX Stock  Click to EnlargeThere is a daily chart to the side and a below that is a weekly chart. Both highlight the not-so-hot setup of CSX stock price right now.As you can see on the daily chart, CSX stock has a very bearish-looking setup. After declining precipitously from $80 in mid-July, shares continue to put in a series of lower highs. That's squeezing CSX against a static level of support near $64. Should support give way, the stock will start probing the 2019 lows.CSX stock is already below all of its major moving averages and Fibonacci retracements. The 20-day is below the 50-day moving average, and the 50-day is crossing below the 200-day. This indicates that both short- and long-term momentum is turning in the bears' favor.For bulls to have a shot, they first need $63 to $64 to prove itself as support. From there, they need to get CSX over downtrend resistance (blue line) and the 20-day moving average. If they can muster up the strength for that, clearing the 61.8% retracement near $67 is next on the list.Should support fail, the year-to-date lows near $60 are the first target. Below that and the 52-week lows near $58 are next.  Click to EnlargeOn the longer term chart, investors can see that CSX is teetering on its 200-week moving average. While the action hasn't been decisive, shares are actually below this mark now. This key moving average drew in buyers last December, halting CSX's decline and kickstarting a multi-month rally.The same momentum has not been seen this time around. Furthermore, long-term uptrend support (blue line) is being leaned on as well. If these levels give way, a decline to $58 is surely possible.On both charts, a rebound over $71 would be most encouraging for the bulls. Valuing CSX StockAn escalating trade war and worries about a recession do not help companies like CSX Corp. What does help CSX, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and other rail companies is a strong consumer.Thankfully, that's exactly what we have. With a strong labor market and consumers who are willing to spend -- as noted by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Visa (NYSE:V) and others -- demand for products remains high. Should that change, then the rails could be in trouble.Some of that fear is getting priced into the stock as we speak. With an inverting yield curve and manic headlines driving the news each day, how can investors not start to price in that possibility?Of course, it doesn't help when CSX stock fails to deliver as well. In July, the company missed on second-quarter expectations. Revenue of $3.06 billion missed estimates by more than $80 million and contracted 1.3% year-over-year. Earnings of $1.08 per share missed consensus estimates by 3 cents a share. Making matters worse, management cut its full-year revenue outlook.This came after five straight earnings and revenue beats. In Q1, CSX beat earnings estimates by more than 10% and grew revenue 4.75% year-over-year. To say Q2 was disappointing is an understatement.With additional tariffs looming, we may see some &quot;pull ahead&quot; from buyers in the current quarter. Further, we're coming up to Q3 and Q4, which are typically heavy demand months for consumers. If that's enough to improve the fundamentals for CSX stock, we'll need to it reflected on the charts.Over $67 give the bulls some spark. Over $71 and momentum can really pick up.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Kenwell is long V.

2019-08-25	2019-08-25 14:53:52	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	5 âStrong Buyâ Stocks Hedge Funds Love Right Now	If you are looking for some fresh investing inspiration, look no further. Hedge funds have just revealed their second quarter trades, and the results are now in. RBC Capital has analyzed the 2Q19 13fâs of 363 major hedge funds with significant stakes in US equities. And from this data it has compiled a list of hedge fundsâ most popular stocks right now i.e. stocks with the most hedge fund dollars invested. âIn our experience, crowded names among active managers, including hedge funds, are usually crowded for a reason (good fundamentals). Most of our baskets of crowded names have outperformed since we started tracking the data at the end of 2010, and our stats can be used to make the case for hedge fund managementâ comments the firm. Nonetheless the firm does add that positioning is still a risk factor worth monitoring. After all, outperformance of popular hedge fund longs has occurred against the backdrop of strong growth leadership in the market âand may merely reflect the underlying style bias of the market that has been in placeâ says RBC Capital. Notably 60% of the list falls in TIMT (technology, internet, media and telecommunications), down from 70% last quarter.Here we take a closer look at five top stocks that feature in the Top 20 list. Whatâs more all these stocks also score a âStrong Buyâ analyst consensus, based on all the ratings over the last three months. Letâs see which five stocks make the grade now: 1&#92;. Microsoft (MSFT)Microsoft refused to give up its no. 1 position in the second quarter. It remains the most popular hedge fund stock- despite a sizable decline in the number of funds owning the stock (for the second quarter in a row). Indeed, RBC Capital reveals that hedge funds still hold a whopping $18,131 million of Microsoft shares. Thatâs with 29% of the 363 funds that it examined holding MSFT stock. Luckily for these funds MSFT scores a firm âStrong Buyâ analyst consensus. That's with a $154 average price target (15% upside potential). Out of 24 analysts covering MSFT right now, 22 are bullish with only 1 hold rating and 1 sell rating (from long time MSFT bear Jefferies' John Difucci). âWe maintain a bullish stance on MSFT as one of our top cloud ideas to own in 2019 based on a multiyear transformation of the model driven by commercial cloud revenue that could reach $100B in CY23 from a $44B run-rate todayâ celebrated KeyBanc analyst Brent Bracelin after the company reported a solid revenue beat on commercial cloud growth of 39% y/y.Aptly calling his report âOn Cloud Nineâ, the analyst reiterated his MSFT buy rating while ramping up the price target from $143 to $155. Fiscal 4Q19 results impressed as it sustained double-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter, despite a material two-point FX headwind, summed up Bracelin.  2&#92;. Facebook (FB)Facebook shifted up a notch in the second quarter. The social media giant is now the third favorite hedge fund stock, up from fourth place in Q1. Thatâs due to Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) slipping from 2 to 4 in the quarter after seeing a double-digit decline in ownership. In contrast, six new funds bought into FB in Q2.According to RBC Capital, 34% of the funds it tracks hold Facebook stock, while the total value of the holding comes out at $16,191 million (so still quite a way off Microsoft). Analysts share this bullish outlook. With 33 out of 36 analysts calling FB a buy, the $234 average price target suggests over 30% upside lies ahead.  Rosenblatt Securities analyst Mark Zgutowicz believes that the demand picture for FB properties could not be stronger. âWe maintain our Buy rating and $242 PT on FB shares and would be aggressive buyers on any weakness related to the 4Q guide decelerationâ he instructed investors recently. Demand for the feeds remains high, says Zgutowicz, given stellar ROAS [return on ad spend] and Stories ad tests are steadily progressing at still a low bar for the stock. âOur checks with direct response advertisers continue to point to stellar ROAS on the triple strength targeting platform of News Feed (NF), Messenger and Instagramâ he concluded.   3&#92;. Netflix (NFLX)Netflix is hedge fundsâ fifth most popular stock. Funds have now invested a jaw-dropping $10,504 million in the stock, with two new funds creating NFLX positions in Q2. As a result, just over a fifth of the funds polled hold NFLX in their portfolio. So does this mean we have a buying opportunity at hand? After all the stock has pulled back significantly following disappointing earnings results. According to the Street, the answer seems to be yes. The stock is showing a Strong Buy consensus with an average price target of $423. This translates into considerable upside potential of 45%. âItâs still early in the quarter, but data through July looks solid (rebound from 2Q),â commented SunTrust Robinsonâs Matthew Thornton on August 19. âGoogle searches (on keyword âNetflixâ) and mobile app downloads for the month also show nice upticks vs 2Q19 and back toward or above the 1Q19 high-water-mark.âAlthough NFLX lost 126,000 US customers in the second quarter, Thornton believes popular series like Sacred Games, The Crown and Peaky Blinders can help stem the losses. With this in mind, the analyst reiterated his NFLX buy rating and $402 price target. A similar message comes from Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger. âThe defining question for investors coming out of Netflix [second quarter] is whether the subscriber miss was simply natural variation (tied to a price increase) in a long-term growth trajectory, in other words a âblip,â he told investors. âWe think the case for âthis is a blipâ is compelling.â Clearly hedge funds think so too.  4&#92;. Boeing (BA)Boeing was a new name to the Top 20 hedge fund list in Q2. The worldâs largest aerospace company now features in 19% of the 363 funds in RBCâs study (with 9 funds creating new positions in the quarter). These funds own a total of $5,458 million of BA stock.And on the whole analysts would approve of the fund enthusiasm for BA. If we look at only the Streetâs best-performing analysts, the consensus works out at âStrong Buy.â Plus the $429 average analyst price target indicates 20% upside lies ahead. Of course, all eyes are on Boeingâs 737 Max plane, which suffered two fatal crashes in a five-month span and is currently grounded. According to Bloomberg, there about 600 planes now out of service. However, the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) just indicated that the model could be ungrounded come October.  âWe continue to support the FAA and global regulators on the safe return of the Max to service,â Boeing said in a statement. Following the latest news, five-star Cowen & Co analyst Cai Rumohr reiterated his buy rating with a bullish $460 price target (29% upside potential). He sees a 3-to-1 positive risk-reward around the FAA certification, and expects the stock to react to early indicators of success/failure.âMAX recovery profile looks intact, and FAA certification flight could be 4-6 weeks off -- a key milestone for the stockâ Rumohr said. âTraffic growth, 787 demand, 777x schedule are &quot;watch&quot; items; but they are offset by robust 787 cash generation.â Bottom line: BA remains the analystâs top pick for cash flow per share of $30+ (9-10% yield) in 2020 & 2021. 5&#92;. Union Pacific Corp (UNP) Union Pacific is a leading railroad franchise, covering 23 states in the western two-thirds of the United States. Like BA, UNP is a new addition to the Top 20 list of hedge fund stock holdings. Eight new funds created UNP positions in Q2, while the total $ value owned now stands at $5,157 million. We can also see that 15% of funds in RBCâs study own Union Pacific.So whatâs driving this wave of bullish sentiment? Well, the company just posted a 2Q EPS and EBIT beat and a record operating ratio despite being significantly hindered by flooding. âWe raise our estimates and PT and continue recommending UNP as a top pickâ five-star Cowen & Co analyst Jason Seidl wrote following earnings. He now sees shares hitting $184 vs his previous $180 price target. âUNP is one of the best managed North American Class I railroads and the only western one that is publicly tradedâ stated Seidl. With the hire of Jim Vena as COO, he believes the company is on its way to revenue improvement.Thatâs thanks to the adoption of Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR). Created by the late Hunter Harrison, PSR refers to the principle of generating extra revenues by using fewer railcars and locomotives. According to Seidl, UNP's precision scheduled railroading rollout is on the right track so far. He notes, for instance, a 10% increase in train length that has seen UNP increase their parked locomotives to 2,150.

You have to look at international demand and look backwards,"" said Jay O'Neil, a consultant and agricultural economist.  Meanwhile, the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China has dashed the hopes of U.S. soybean producers again for this upcoming fall because China has drastically cut its imports of U.S. soybeans."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-competition-trade-uncertainty-weigh-134845018.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-15	2019-08-15 11:34:40	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Oracle, Salesforce and Union Pacific	The S&P 500 lost nearly 3% of its value yesterday, as an inversion of the yield curve convinced enough traders the risk of a recession is all too real. It remains to be seen if investors will continue to believe it, but the selloff to date still doesn't qualify as a full-blown &quot;correction.&quot;Source: Shutterstock Macy's (NYSE:M) led the way with its 13% plunge in response to a big earnings miss, underscored by warnings that tariffs were becoming problematic. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 6%, as it was pegged as one of the more vulnerable names of a global economic slowdown.Yet, there were some winners despite Wednesday's misery. FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), for instance, gained nearly 3% for reasons investors are still trying to ferret out. Rival cybersecurity stocks didn't fare any better than the broad market did on Wednesday.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul Headed into Thursday's action, keep a close eye on the stock charts of Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP). These names may make for your best trading bets. Union Pacific (UNP)It ended up coming back from the brink of the start of a truly devastating breakdown thanks to yesterday's late-session rally. But, Union Pacific shares remain uncomfortably close to that last-ditch line in the sand. If one more bad day is allowed to take shape, it could mean a key floor snaps and opens the floodgates. And, for the record, UNP shares are likely already fighting a losing battle for two (semi-related) reasons.The good news is, the most plausible landing spots for any pullback are well defined.  *   Click to EnlargeThe last-ditch line in the sand is $163.50, plotted in red on both stock charts. That's where Union Pacific have found lows since June, and near where the white 200-day moving average line is now.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart of UNP it becomes clear that the stock is being guided higher within the confines of bullish trend lines. The recent bump into the upper one sets the stage for a retreat back to the lower one, both marked in blue. (The red dashed line as an alternative floor.)  * It's not evident on the chart, but railroad traffic has been tepid this year, with traffic falling back below 2017's and 2018's levels. Oracle (ORCL)It has more to do with the broad market's weakness than Oracle in particular. Nevertheless, the situation ORCL shares are in leaves them more vulnerable to major trouble than what most other stocks are facing at this time. And, the bears have already tipped what seems to be a pretty strong hand.There's also a great deal of similarity to the UNP stock chart. That is, Oracle shares are in a major, long-term uptrend but due for at least a small pullback to the lower edge of that trading channel.  * 7 5G Stocks to Buy Now for the Future   *   Click to EnlargeAs was the case with Union Pacific, Oracle's long-term bullish trading range is marked with blue lines on the weekly chart. The other potential floor is plotted with a red dashed line. Both will be around $46 by the time they could be tested.  * It's not likely to be a coincidence that Wednesday's selling was halted right at the 200-day moving average, plotted in white on both stock charts.  * Although not decidedly bearish yet, notice there seems to be more bearish volume than not. The daily chart's falling accumulation-distribution line quantifies that mostly qualitative idea. Salesforce (CRM)Finally, as far as breakdowns go, the line Salesforce has dished out since the beginning of this month has been sloppy to the point of being untrustworthy. That is to say, this usually choppy stock could easily, seemingly, snap back to a bullish mode with just the smallest bit of help from the broad market.On the other hand, we're seeing a few more subtle red flags now that we hadn't seen in a long while. Things could get worse for owners before they get better.  *   Click to EnlargeThe chief concern is the break below the 200-day moving average line, marked in white on both stock charts. Underscoring that potential problem is the fact that all other moving average lines are en-route to falling below the 200-day line as well.  * Although we've seen volume spikes on bearish days before, we've not yet seen persistently bearish days with this much sustained selling volume.  * With no other technical framework to point to likely landing spots, the next most likely floor is around $123.35, where the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line awaits.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-13	2019-08-13 15:20:14	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Run Away from CSX Stock as It Comes Way off the Rails	It's fair to say that over the past month, CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) has come off the rails. During the past month, CSX stock sunk as the transportation giant reported miserable second-quarter numbers in mid-July.Source: Shutterstock Revenues missed expectations by a wide margin, the biggest miss since early 2016. Earnings also missed expectations by the widest margin in the past five years. More important, the full-year guide was cut sharply to well-below consensus levels.Ever since, CSX stock has dropped nearly 20%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome contrarian investors might see this big drop in CSX as an opportunity to buy into a company that ostensibly seems very stable. But, while I love to play the contrarian, I don't think buying the dip in CSX here is the right move.  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now The reality is that CSX stock has come off the rails, and there's no reason to step in the way of this &quot;off the rails&quot; train just yet. The fundamentals are weak and will likely get worse before they get better. The optics are ugly and won't improve anytime soon. Meanwhile, the analyst community is growing increasingly bearish and won't provide any support; neither will the technicals, since CSX has blown through pretty much all of its important technical and psychological levels.In sum, then, there's no reason to step in the way of this sell-off just yet. Instead, the smart move here is let this sell-off play out, and then buy the dip once the fundamentals, optics, and technicals become more supportive of a rebound rally. The Rail Industry Is off the RailsThe 20% plunge in CSX stock over the past month is not unique to this specific company. Instead, it is part of a more wide-sweeping sell-off across the entire rail industry.Alongside CSX, peer rail transport companies Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), and Trinity (NYSE:TRN) all reported Q2 revenue misses with sluggish volume growth. All four stocks have fallen 8% or more over the past month.Under the hood, the trade war is having a materially negative impact on the U.S. manufacturing sector. When the manufacturing sector slows, demand for rail transport slows, too, since companies are responding by transporting less volume, less frequently.When volumes drop, margins take a hit because costs aren't coming out of the system as quickly as volumes are dropping. Further, this pain may just be beginning. The trade war has escalated over the past few weeks, and as it has, it's become increasingly clear that elevated trade tensions and slowing manufacturing activity are here to stay for the foreseeable future.As such, the outlook for CSX and the entire rail industry over the next several months is sluggish volume growth alongside potential margin compression. That's a losing combo. No Reason to Buy the Dip YetAt some point, this dip in CSX becomes a compelling buying opportunity, since CSX is a stable company with healthy long term growth prospects.But, that point isn't here yet. Instead, at the current moment, there's very little reason to step in the way of this CSX stock sell-off.First, as outlined above, rail industry fundamentals aren't good now, nor do they project to improve anytime soon given trade war escalation. Second, CSX isn't a standout in this industry. Instead, they've been hit like everyone else during this rail slowdown, reporting negative revenue growth last quarter.Third, the optics here are bad. Investors quite simply do not want trade war exposure at the current moment. CSX stock has a ton of trade war exposure. As such, it is unlikely that investors will be attracted to the stock anytime soon.Further, analysts are cutting estimates and the number of Buy recommendations on the stock has dropped from 11 at the beginning of the year, to five today, according to YCharts. Thus, there isn't much support from the analyst community, either, and without that support, investors likely aren't inclined to buy the dip in bulk.Fourth, the technicals are broken. During this most recent sell-off, CSX blew through its 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages without any regard for those technical support levels. The next psychological level of support comes in at $65, where the stock has shown resilience before. Until the stock does show support there, there's little reason to believe that there's much technical support in this stock anywhere.Overall, there's simply very little reason to step in the way of this sell-off today. It increasingly appears that there's more pain ahead for CSX. Investors should only buy the dip once it appears that the worst has passed. Bottom Line on CSX StockThings are bad at CSX right now. The unfortunate reality is that things will probably get worse before they get better. That means that the recent 20% plunge in CSX stock isn't an opportunity. Instead, the stock will likely sell-off more before it bottoms.As such, now isn't the time to buy the dip in CSX stock. Rather, it's time to steer clear.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-02	2019-08-02 18:29:30	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	CSX Stock Will Likely Continue to Fall Amid Economic Uncertainty	Due to CSX's (NYSE:CSX) earnings and revenue miss, many analysts and pundits have begun to take a more bearish view of CSX stock. With its 2019 revenues set to fall 1%-2%, according to its own estimates, CSX could face a rough ride. Also, the trade war with China and signs of an economic slowdown have weighed on CSX's freight volumes and intermodal transport business.Source: Shutterstock The low cost of rail transport has and will continue to bolster CSX's business model in the long-term. However, falling revenues and economic headwinds look positioned to derail CSX stock for the foreseeable future.  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now  CSX Stock Price TumbledOn July 16, CSX stock price fell by more than 10% following the company's earnings. The company's  earnings and revenue fell short of analysts' average expectations. Moreover, the company's guidance also came in below the average estimate. CSX expects its revenues to come in 1%-2% lower than last year's revenue of $12.25 billion or between  $12 billion and $12.13 billion. The average revenue estimate had previously stood at $12.47 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe negative sentiment spread across the railroad industry. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) also plunged on July 16. The sellers appear to have made the right call. Norfolk Southern's earnings subsequently came in below analysts' average estimates, while Union Pacific's top line missed the consensus outlook. The Economic Cycle Bodes Poorly for CSX StockIn a previous article,I predicted that guidance would likely determine the near-term performance of CSX stock. Since the company had already cut its revenue guidance in January, issuing lower guidance a second time destroyed the confidence many had in CSX stock.Additionally, CSX and its peers serve as a proxy for the overall economy. As InvestorPlace columnist James Brumley stated, there is now widespread concern that the economy is slowing.The Fed attempted to address this issue with a cut in interest rates recently. Before this cut, the Federal Reserve had not reduced rates since soon after the 2008 financial crisis. So far, the Fed's move has failed to rejuvenate CSX stock.CSX stock price traded above $71 per share before the cut. Since it occurred, the stock fell for the rest of the week. As of this writing, the CSX stock price now stands at about $66.50 per share.Moreover, InvestorPlace columnist Josh Enomoto points out that CSX stock dropped massively during the 2000 tech bubble and the 2008 financial crisis. During both downturns,  CSX stock price lost more than two-thirds of its value. If rate cuts fail to head off an economic slowdown, I wouldn't be surprised if history repeats itself.I do not necessarily believe that the CSX stock price will fall by two-thirds again. However, it may be vulnerable enough to justify selling the equity. Traders have few reasons to ride out such a downturn. The Bottom Line on CSX StockRail remains the lowest-cost means of transporting freight. For this reason, I like the railroad industry  in general, and I think CSX stock will deliver returns over the long-term.But at this stage, I see more to lose than gain by holding CSX stock at these levels. When investors sour on CSX stock, history has shown that they turn on it hard. The recent rate cut did not boost CSX stock price, and the stock began a new downward move following the news.That does not mean traders should stop paying attention to this company. I think CSX stock will be a great buy during the depths of a recession. However, in the late stages of an economic expansion, traders should stay off the tracks, since for now, CSX is much more likely to report negative news than positive metrics.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-07-26	2019-07-26 12:27:14	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	This Month Could Make or Break CSX Stock, in More Ways Than One	It was the shot heard 'round the railroading world, so to speak. When CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) posted its disappointing second-quarter numbers a week-and-a-half ago, not only did CSX stock crash, it pulled some other -- though not all -- rail stocks like Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) down with it.Source: Shutterstock And for good reason. The company's culling of its revenue outlook for the full year voiced what some in and outside of the industry have been quietly thinking for a while. That is, the economy is slowing down. Several reports confirm this.There's still one last bastion of hope for CSX and its peers. However, if we don't see signs of a recovery soon, in August at the latest, here's the painful reality: CSX stock and most other railroading names could become even more difficult to own.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Red Flags for CSX Stock OwnersWhen CSX CEO James Foote commented, &quot;The present economic backdrop is one of the most puzzling I have experienced in my career,&quot; it wasn't excuse-making. The economy, seemingly healthy on the surface, is showing several cracks under the hood.  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season Railroads have fallen into those cracks, since they are more vulnerable than most sectors to the weak points. As Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz explained as part of his company's post-earnings discussion, &quot;There [are] some unique impacts that are happening to the railroad that aren't reflective of the U.S. or global economy.&quot;  Click to EnlargeThe Q2 numbers from CSX confirm it. Earnings of $1.08 per share of CSX stock were up 7% year-over-year. However, they fell short of the $1.11 analysts were modeling. Revenue of $3.08 billion missed analysts' forecasts as well. Total freight volumes fell 4%. Additionally, intermodal volumes -- accounting for 40% of the company's total volume -- dropped 10% YOY.The American Association of Railroads' data says it wasn't just CSX either. Intermodal traffic snapped back for the past couple of weeks, but somehow remains below 2018's impressive year-to-date levels. Conflicting Data a Source of ConfusionMuch of that weakness became evident by other measures in the meantime. Industrial production stagnated in June. GDP fell during the second quarter rather dramatically. Import prices fell in June by the most they've fallen in six months. New tariffs grinded away at purchases of foreign-made goods.Worse yet, many of those goods which would arrive and be transported in intermodal containers. Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz argued the same, commenting, &quot;We definitely see a trade impact on our grain exports.&quot;Still, not all is harrowing. The United States' unemployment rate remains near multi-year record lows, while wages continue to make their way to record highs. The average consumer appears to be doing just fine despite the impact of tariffs.It's a nuance that wasn't lost on Foote. He added to his assessment, &quot;We are seeing a range of conflicting data points and economic indicators and regularly speak with customers who despite the recent downtime and slowdown, remain cautiously optimistic about the second half.&quot; Seasonal, Cyclical Lull Should Rebound SoonFoote's addendum may have been even more insightful than it initially appeared.Rail-shipping prices have been in decline since March, jibing with the notion that demand is slipping. Intermodal shipping rates have been particularly troubling. They slid from a peak of $151.90 (per mile) in March to June's level of $142. Based on rail transportation standards, that's a significant decline.There's a footnote that must be added to the discussion thoughâ¦two of them actually.One is that intermodal prices reliably slump through June, but just as reliably recover beginning in August. Cass Information Systems plots the annual path of price changes. The company verified that shipping rates for intermodal containers have rebounded from pullbacks early in the year in each of the prior three years.  Click to EnlargeSecond, intermodal shipping prices are falling, but they're falling back from an unusually strong surge in 2017 and 2018. President Trump drove this dynamic using raw willpower to create economic growth. Further price pullbacks would merely pull prices back to more sustainable levels.Though it's a backdrop that should soothe investors fearing the worst lies ahead, the scenario still poses problems. Namely, it suggests that any seasonal recovery might not start promptly in June. And even if it does, it may feel like a half-hearted rebound.  Click to EnlargeIt matters simply because investors are comparing CSX to year-ago results that weren't likely to be sustained no matter how robust the economy was or is. Trade impasses aren't abating either.There's nothing in the mix that spells outright doom for the CSX stock price though; just a lot of turbulence ahead. CSX Stock Price OutlookThat turbulence of late has leaned bearishly. However, it's possible that the performance of the CSX stock price could dramatically worsen before it improves.The post-earnings pullback dragged CSX stock to a long-established support line, but no further. The bulls are trying to stage a rebound effort here. If they fail though, there's not a meaningful support level again until the late-2018 low of $58. Even then, there's no assurance any selling will abate there. The optics, if nothing else, look bad.  Click to EnlargeThe chart and some important news have synced up time-wise. Investors appear content to keep the CSX stock price where it is while they wait and see.Check the American Association of Railroads and the Cass Information Systems data often between now and the next earnings report. If there's no meaningful proof of life by the end of August, it's going to be tough to stick with any long CSX positions.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-22	2019-07-22 11:56:43	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Is It Time for Investors to Get On Board CSX Stock?	It's been kind of choppy for the start of the earnings season. Take a look at CSX Corp. (NYSE:CSX) stock. When the company reported second quarter results, the reaction was swift -- and harsh. The CSX stock price plunged by about 10%, the worst drop since the financial crisis in 2008.Source: Shutterstock As a result, other rail companies like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) saw declines in their stock prices.Now there are some things to keep in mind. First of all, CSX stock is still up about 16% for the year. If anything, the past week's sell-off may have been partly an excuse to take some profits off the table.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNext, the quarterly results for CSX were not necessarily bad. The earnings came in at $1.08 per share, which was a miss of only 2 cents a share. As for the revenues, they were $3.06 billion whereas the Street was looking for $3.14 billion.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown CSX also showed more progress in realizing efficiencies. In the quarter, the operating ratio was 57.4%, down from 58.6% during the same period a year ago. The goal is to maintain a level below 60%.Yet the real problem was the guidance, which was far from inspiring. For the full-year, CSX is projecting a decline on the top-line of 1% to 2%. (Keep in mind that the prior forecast was for a 1% to 2% increase.) If that transpires, it would be the first annual decline since 2016. Puzzling BackdropIn the quarter, there was strength in categories like autos, agriculture products, minerals, fertilizers and chemicals. But the overall growth was not enough to compensate for the 10% drop in intermodal volumes. The net result: a 4% decline to 1.6 million units on a year-over-year basis. While CSX was able to raise prices, it was not enough to keep up the growth for revenues.On the earnings call, CSX CEO James Foote had this to say about the situation: &quot;Both global and U.S. economic conditions have been unusual this year, to say the least, and have impacted our volumes. You see it every week in our reported carloads. The present economic backdrop is one of the most puzzling I have experienced in my career.&quot;  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Granted, he is not saying there will be a recession. Yet it does look like Foote will take a cautious approach. Interestingly enough, it is this kind of psychology that can quickly spread and lead to economic downturns. And this would certainly weigh on CSX stock, as it is highly cyclical. Bottom Line on CSX StockThis week UNP also reported its quarterly results, which beat the Street. The stock rose about 6% on the news. Yet despite this, UNP is also seeing sluggishness on the top-line, as freight revenues were off by 2%. According to CEO Lance Fritz, in an interview with Yahoo Finance: &quot;There [are] some unique impacts that are happening to the railroad that aren't reflective of the U.S. or global economy.&quot;Yes, for the most part, the rail industry appears to be hitting a soft patch.Now, as for CSX stock, the valuation is certainly more reasonable. Note that the forward price-to-earnings multiple is about 16x. And yes, there continue to be share buybacks, with $860 million in purchases for the quarter.But then again, with the swirling uncertainty and revenue pressures, there are few catalysts right now and it would not be surprising if the stock languishes for awhile.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-07-19	2019-07-19 19:00:02	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	CSX Leads Industrial Earnings Off the Rails	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- To get Brooke Sutherlandâs newsletter delivered directly to your inbox, sign up here.Itâs going to be unbearably hot across much of the U.S. this weekend, but the early returns on industrial earnings have been decidedly cool. A nearly 30% run in CSX Corp. shares heading into its second-quarter earnings report suggested this was a company where investors thought they could find shelter amid a growing body of worrisome manufacturing data. They were wrong. The shares slumped more than 10% the day after CSX reversed a forecastÂ for low single-digit growthÂ in revenue this year and predicted instead that revenue would dip as much as 2%. The East Coast railroad says itâs being cautious, but the time for conservatism is when you start the guidance-giving process,Â so that strikes me as an inadequateÂ explanation for such a deep cut. CEO James Foote said the macroeconomic backdrop was one of the most âpuzzlingâ heâs ever experienced and that there are no concrete signs of improvement in weak coal, intermodal and industrial volumes.Elsewhere in transportation, J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. and West Coast railroad Union Pacific Corp. actually saw their shares pop on earnings, but that seems to be a case of more realistic expectations than a drastically more positive view of the macroeconomic environment. J.B. Hunt was essentially flat going into earnings, for example, and Union Pacific had sold off in sympathy with CSX before it reported. Union Pacific said it expects second-half volume to be down about 2%, which implies a decline for the full year compared with an earlier call for a low-single digit gain â basically mimicking CSXâs move. The other challenge with CSX is that it appears to be far enough along in its conversion to precision-scheduled railroading that there isnât as much fat left to cut as there is at Union Pacific. But itâs track record of improved performance is still relatively short, capping its ability to make market share gains amid a surplus of capacity and lower spot rates in the trucking market.Â Bloomberg NewsâsÂ Cameron Crise points out the sharp divergence in the performance of S&P 500 railroads and FedEx Corp. over the past, calling it a proxy of sorts for the trade war-inspired slowdown thatâs hit companies with international exposure like FedEx harder than those focused on the domestic market. If U.S. railroad stocks fail to recover from the CSX-inspired selloff and the gap to FedEx narrows, that could be a sign that the domestic economy and the bull market are running out of steam, he writes. FedEx, of course, has plenty of idiosyncratic issues holding back its stock. The companyâs annual report filed this week included interesting disclosures abut the risk of an activist shareholder getting involved and some additional detail on the logistics investments that could render Amazon.com Inc. a competitor.Â Things were a bit better at the multi-industrial companies, but there was still cause for concern. Textron Inc. said its aviation backlog slipped by $100 million in the second quarter as macroeconomic concerns and President Donald Trumpâs threat to impose wide-ranging tariffs on Mexico spooked business-jet customers. Thatâs counteracted by Honeywell International Inc.âs report of double-digit sales growth for new business jet equipment, but still a troubling sign of just how nervous people are about making big investments. You can usually count on Honeywell to churn out an earnings beat, and the company didnât disappoint, raising its profit guidance for the full year. But the outlook wasnât as robust as some analystsÂ were expecting. Organic sales growth of 5% could end up being the pace to beat this quarter, but that was weaker than anticipated and a forecastÂ for 2% to 4% growth in the third quarter would suggest an accelerating slowdown. The dynamic of somewhat disappointing sales numbers but steady earnings growth in some ways reinforces Honeywellâs argument that last yearâs breakups and a pristine balance sheet will make it more resilient in a downturn, but I remain unconvinced that margins for anything except funeral homes are recession-proof. It helped Honeywell that the sales weakness was mostly confined to its safety and productivity solutions unit, the smallest of its four main businesses, and aerospace remained impressively robust with 11% organic sales growth. The industrial companies on tap to report earnings next week may not be so lucky, particularly 3M Co., which seems destined for yet another guidance cut to reflect the deepening slowdown.ALL BOEING WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS IS A FLYABLE MAXBoeing Co. this week pre-announced a $4.9 billion after-tax second-quarter charge to reflect its estimate of compensation owed to airlines grappling with a grounding of the beleaguered 737 Max thatâs now entering its fifth month. American Airlines Group Inc., Southwest Airlines Co. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. this week pulled the Max from their schedules through the beginning of November â a timeline that jibes with Boeingâs call for the plane to return to service during the fourth quarter. But the risk remainsÂ that the grounding stretches into 2020. The Federal Aviation Administration, mindful of restoring its reputation as the global standard-bearer of safety protocol, is keen to coordinate a return to service with European and Asian regulators. And while a fix for the flight-software system linked to the Maxâs two fatal crashes has essentially been completed, there remain hurdles to remedying a separate issue with a microprocessor that was identified in June, including convincing the FAA that a software update is sufficient, according to the Wall Street Journal. Even if Boeing can get the plane recertified and flying again by the fourth quarter, it matters a great deal whichÂ particular month that happens. Airlines estimate it will take a month to 45 days to completeÂ the maintenance necessary to bring the Max jets they already operate out of storage, which is to say nothing of the additional planes they had been expecting to support busy schedules. I would imagine airlinesâ demands for compensation would rise materially if they are forced to scramble and reassess capacity for holiday flights. Ryanair Holdings Plc said this week itâs prudently planning for a December return of the Max, but pared its growth plans for the 2020 summer travel season. It can only accept six to eight new Max planes per month, which will leave the budget airline with about half of the fleet it had been planning on for that peak season. Data points like that make me highly skeptical of Boeingâs aspirations to ramp up to a 57-per-month production pace for the 737 program in 2020.A WORD ON WAREHOUSESThere has been a surge of spending over the past few years on industrial warehouse assets. The latest deal cameÂ this week , whenÂ Prologis Inc. agreed to buy Industrial Property Trust and its 236 properties in areas such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago and New Jersey for about $4 billion. This follows PrologisâsÂ acquisition of DCT Industrial Trust Inc. last year for more than $8 billion and its pursuit earlier this year of GLP Pteâs U.S. warehouse assets, which ultimately went to Blackstone Group LP instead for $18.7 billion. Meanwhile, Tom Barrackâs Colony Capital Inc. is exploring a sale of its unit that owns warehouses as part of a strategic review meant to resuscitate its plunging market value, according to Bloomberg News. I understand the logic of these deals: Retailers are under immense pressure to build out their e-commerce capabilities and shorten their delivery times and on the face of it, that trend looks less vulnerable to the trade war and macroeconomic uncertainties than many others. Even so, it gives me pause to hear Honeywell say customers for its Intelligrated warehouse-automation business are pushing major system rollouts into the second half of the year. Intelligrated is still growing rapidly, with organic sales growth of more than 20% for the first half of 2019, and Honeywell CEO Darius Adamczyk said he knew for a fact that the delayed orders hadnât gone away. But going back to my earlierÂ comment about funeral homes, Iâm getting less confident that even this trend can withstand the test of a true downturn. I asked Bloomberg Opinion's retail expert Sarah Halzack what she thought. She pointed out that companies like Walmart Inc. and Williams-Sonoma Inc. are too far along in converting their businesses to e-commerce to back out, whereas those who are already struggling such as J.C. Penney Co. will find it harder to justify making those kinds of investments.DEALS, ACTIVISTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCEJohn Flannery has resurfaced. The former CEO of General Electric Co.Â will now be an advisory director to Charlesbank Capital Partners, a middle-market private equity firm managing more than $5 billion of capital. Iâve always felt a bit bad for Flannery, who spent 30 years working his way up the ladder at GE and finally ascended to the CEO post, only to find out that his actual job was going to be more akin to a garbage man. Sure, he made his share of mistakes as CEO. But the reality is he was probably never going to last in that job no matter what he did. GE needed one CEO to publicize and unearth the skeletons in its closet ($22 billion goodwill writedown on the disastrous Alstom SA deal, $15 billion reserve shortfall in the long-term care insurance business) and another CEO to try to fix the mess. Thatâs now Larry Culp. Still, it has to sting a bit that Steve Bolze, Flanneryâs competitor in the race to succeed Jeff Immelt, is a senior managing director at Blackstone, a slightly more prominentÂ firm than Charlesbank. Bolze is blamed by many investors for mismanaging GEâs power unit and exacerbating the financial pain from a slump in gas turbine demand.Crane Co.âs bid for Circor International Inc. got a last minute surge of support. Mario Gabelliâs Gamco Investors Inc. agreed to tender sharesÂ to Crane after the buyer raised its price to $48 a share earlier this month. Roughly 45% of outstanding Circor shares have been elected to be tendered, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. Thatâs not enough to force a merger (although there are still a few more hours before the tender offer expires at midnight), but it should be enough to get the attention of Circorâs boardâs. In the wake of the Crane offer, Circor laid out a bold (and by nature, rather fluffy) plan to boost margins and lower debt. Shareholders are now signaling quite loudly that they donât have much faith in the companyâs ability to follow through. Itâs pretty remarkable to see this level of pushback outside of an annual meeting, though. I had worried Craneâs bid might have been the victim of bad timing, with its offer becoming public a few weeks after Circorâs 2019 meeting. The fact that Circorâs board had privately received the Crane offer prior to the meeting and didnât feel a need to tell investors about it has been one of Gabelliâs chief criticisms. This level of support from Circor shareholders may save Crane from having to wait a year to relaunch its bid with a proxy fight.Osram Licht AG, the lighting maker thatâs agreed to sell itself to Bain Capital and Carlyle Group LP, disclosed this week that Austrian industrial manufacturer AMS AG had made a fresh offer for the company at a higher price. Bain and Carlyle are offering 35 euros per share, or 3.4 billion euros ($3.8 billion), while AMS had proposed to pay 38.50 euros per share, or about 3.7 billion euros. The problem is, AMS itself is valued at less than what it offered for Osram; itâs had negative free cash flow for at least the past two years; and itâsÂ already carrying about 1.2 billion euros of net debt. Osram agreed to let AMS perform due diligence, but said the probability of a deal materializing was ârather low.â Literally the same day that its latest offer was disclosed, AMS said it was walking away. In some ways thatâs actually kind of surprising â why wouldnât you take the opportunity to do due diligence? But anyway, this amusing M&A adventure has now come to an end.Callon Petroleum Co. agreed to buy Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at $3.2 billion including debt. Bernstein analyst Bob Brackett called it a âpretty lame deal all-in-allâ, while my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Liam Denning said the merger sounds a âdistinct sad-trombone note.âÂ Carrizo helps Callon double down on the Delaware Basin with contiguous acreage and lets it add free cash flow on the cheap, but it also dilutes its status as a pure-play operator by adding acreage the Eagle Ford region, where it may be harder to find cost savings. Some investors may have viewed Callon as a target and are disappointed to see it on the other end of aÂ deal. The consolidation of shale players is healthy and necessary, Liam writes. But the fact that Carrizo has chosen to sell at a modest premium when its stock was trading at the lowest levels in a decade is pretty telling, too.CRH Plc agreed to sell its European plumbing and heating-distribution business to BlackstoneÂ for 1.64 billion euros ($1.9 billion). CEO Albert Manifold has been trying to steer the company toward higher growth markets including cement and raise money for acquisitions. This deal helps it do both. Davy analyst Robert Gardiner says the purchase price is attractive at about 16 times earnings before interest and taxes.BONUS READING Saturday Will Be Hot.

Williams said that when rates and inflation are low, policymakers cannot afford to keep their ""powder dry"" and wait for potential economic problems to materialize.  ""He's toeing the party line at the Fed, basically implying that an insurance rate cut is the right thing to do for the economy at this point in time,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina, referring to Williams' comments."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-wall-street-rises-192947754.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-18	2019-07-18 14:00:02	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	The Amtrak That Works, and the Amtrak That Doesnât	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- By the time it crossed the Mississippi River at Burlington, Iowa, last week, our California Zephyr was running more than eightÂ hours late on its journey from the San Francisco Bay Area to Chicago. The last meal, a free, off-menu beef stew, had just been served in the dining car. My wife and I opted instead to consume a couple of Maruchan Instant Lunch cups, purchased in the cafe, accompanied by a half bottle of Kendall-Jackson chardonnay, also from the cafe. Occasional wafts of sewage odor tainted the air, the aging Superliner cars creaked and rattled, and the dining- and sleeping-car staff exuded fatigue and resignation. Even the conductor, who had just gotten on at Ottumwa, sounded appropriately defeated when he reaffirmed over the loudspeaker that, yes, every connecting train in Chicago, including the Lakeshore Limited to New York for which we had tickets,Â would be leaving before our train got there.Things did improve a little once we entered Illinois. My wife got an unexpected email from Amtrak with a PDFÂ ticket attached for the next dayâs Lakeshore Limited, in more spacious accommodations than what we had originally booked. The train also started going consistently faster, mostly between 70 and 80 miles an hour, chipping away at our estimated arrival time by a minute here and a minute thereÂ until we were forced to sit still outside the Chicago suburb of Naperville to let a Metra commuter train go by. After a lovely day in Chicago (we stayed with friends, but Amtrak would have put us up in a hotel if needed), we boarded the train to New York only to learn that its departure would be delayed two hours to wait on two very late trains arriving via different routes from Los Angeles, the Southwest Chief and Texas Eagle. The conductor sounded irked about this rather than resigned, and over the next 20 hours we made up about a third of the lost time, arriving in Manhattan in the middle of a minor blackout that spared Penn Station but made getting home from there something of an adventure. Isnât long-distance train travel great!?!Actually, it is. Iâm not hankering to get on the California Zephyr again anytime soon, but Iâm glad to have had the experience. It offered spectacular scenery, mealtime encounters with interesting people from all over (if youâre in a party of less than four, youâre always seated with strangers), and hour after hour after hour of mostly blissful reading and napping. A few months ago, the New York Times Magazine had a detailed account by journalist/humorist Caity Weaver of a trip from New York to Los Angeles on the Lakeshore Limited and Southwest Chief that captured the vibe quite nicely, so Iâll stop here with the travelogueÂ and start with some numbers.Yes, thatâs right: The California Zephyr, with one eastbound train a day and one westbound, lost more money last year than any other service operated by the National Railroad Passenger Corp., aka Amtrak. On a per-passenger-mile basis, it wasnâtÂ so bad (the three-times-a-week Sunset Limited was the worst), but still, the operating losses from the California Zephyr, Southwest Chief and Empire Builder together nearly equaled Amtrakâs total fiscal 2018 operating loss of $170.6 million. Since the start of fiscal 2019Â in October, the California Zephyr alone has lost $40.9 million, even as Amtrakâs operating loss has dwindled to $50.9 million and is projected to approachÂ zero for the full fiscal year.This is possible becauseÂ Amtrak also operates on shorter routes with much more frequent services thatÂ carry many more passengersÂ andÂ in some cases even turn big operating profits:These numbers include subsidies from the states, which add up to about 7% of overall operating revenue, with California and Illinois the biggest contributors. They leave out capital expenditures, which are highest for the Northeast Corridor along which the Acela and Northeast Regional trains travel because Amtrak owns most of the track and is thus responsible for its upkeep. The California Zephyr uses track owned and maintained by freight railroads BNSF, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and Union Pacific Corp. But thatâs actually a big part of the problem faced by it and other long-distanceÂ routes.The 1970 federal law that released private railroads from the obligation to carry passengers and created Amtrak decreed that its trains be given priority over freight. But because Amtrakâs long-distance trainsÂ run infrequently on tracks controlled by others and a certain amount of schedule unpredictability is inherent inÂ the distances they travel â and because, Amtrak complains, the freight railroads arenât obeying the law âÂ they are constantly being delayed by conditions outside their control.The California Zephyr that I traveled on started out about an hour late because of engine problems, kept getting later because of congestion and track work, had to restrict its speed while climbing the Rockies in Colorado because it was hot out, took a seeming eternity to back into and thenÂ pull out ofÂ Denverâs Union Station, endured more track-repair-related slowdowns amid the waterlogged cornfields of Nebraska, then came to a halt because the conductors and engineer had been on the job for 12 hours straight and another federal law required that they sit tight until a replacement crew came in from Lincoln. On the westward journey two weeks earlier, my wife and son (he and I each flew one way) spent several early-morning hours parked near the Nevada-Utah border after their train pulled onto a siding to let a faster-moving freight train pass, and the freight engine promptly broke down.On track that Amtrak owns or otherwise exercises some control over â or even just uses frequently enough that its comings and goings can be counted upon â these problems are less pronounced. AmtrakâsÂ Northeast Corridor trains were on time at 76.2% of their stops in fiscal 2018 and its other short-haul trains 77.7%. For the long-distance trains, that percentage was only 52.1%, even though theyâre subjected to a looser definition of âon timeâ than shorter routes are.(1)Amtrak, then, is really running two train systems. One provides residents of cities in the Northeast, Midwest and along the West Coast with regional train service thatâs not great by Western European or East Asian standards but is useful to lots of peopleÂ and seems like it could get by on ticket revenue, state subsidies, and some federal help with financing big capital projects such as that much-needed new tunnel under the Hudson River. The other consistsÂ of 15 longer routes that have appeal for tourists, residents of some isolated towns and airplane-shunning Amish folkÂ (if riding Amtrak through the Midwest was your only experience of this country, youâd think it was about 10% Amish)Â but cannot survive without ongoing operating subsidies from Congress. The $1.9 billion that Congress appropriated to Amtrak for fiscal 2019Â amounts to only about 0.04% of total federal spending, and one could perhaps argue that subsidies for long-distance rail are worth it in some kind of nation-building or nation-advertising sense. But those subsidies do seem to reduce Washingtonâs appetite for investments to upgrade Amtrakâs more heavily traveled intercity offerings, which are of far more economic value.Current Amtrak Chief Executive Officer Richard Anderson, who once held the same job at Delta Air Lines Inc., has considered this situation and, as the Wall Street Journalâs Ted Mann described a few weeks ago, understandably concluded that the long-distanceÂ routes arenât a priority. Last year, for example, Anderson saidÂ that rather than pay to maintain a 219-mile stretch ofÂ Southwest Chief track that owner BNSF no longer uses, Amtrak would replace the train with bus service between Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Dodge City, Kansas.The White House has taken a similar stance, arguing in the proposed fiscal-year 2020 budget that:The Long Distance network has not changed from its original iteration 40 years ago. It does not provide efficient services in areas where passenger rail is a competitive form of transportation and inadequately serves low population areas through which they [sic] travel with infrequent and inconvenient service. The Budget proposes that Federal operating support for Long Distance routes would now be provided through the Restoration and Enhancement (R&E) Grant program, not Amtrak's annual grant, and then phased out entirely.Senators from the affected states forced Anderson to back down on his Southwest Chief plan, though, at least through this fiscal year. And President Donald TrumpÂ âÂ who seems at bestÂ only faintly aware ofÂ the things that Office of Management and BudgetÂ Director (and acting chief of staff) Mick Mulvaney puts in the annual budget proposals âÂ surely isnât going to makeÂ cutting rural train service a priority in the run-up to the 2020 election, and wouldnât make any headway on Capitol Hill even if he did.Â If Iâve read the maps correctly, the 10 money-losing long-distance trains in the table above travel through 36 states, while the 10 most popular routes touch just 14.Â Amtrak definitely has a future, withÂ ridership up 41% since 2000. But the arithmetic of U.S. Senate representation and Electoral College votes may keep it chained to its past for a while yet.(1) Trips of up to 250 miles are considered on time if they arrive less than 10 minutes beyond the scheduled arrival time; 251-350 miles, 15 minutes; 351-450 miles, 20 minutes; 451-550 miles, 25 minutes; and greater than 550 miles, 30 minutes.To contact the author of this story: Justin Fox at justinfox@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Brooke Sample at bsample1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Justin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

CSX hauled 4% less freight in the latest quarter, when it experienced a ""lazy, malaise-type drift down"" that accelerated into June and is more difficult to plan for than a sharp drop in demand, Chief Executive James Foote told investors on a conference call."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-quarterly-profit-beats-130331063.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-18	2019-07-18 12:15:00	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Union Pacific&apos;s stock bounces after earnings beat, but revenue falls a bit shy	Shares of Union Pacific Corp.  rallied 2.5% in premarket trading Thursday, after the railroad company reported second-quarter earnings that beat expectations, while revenue fell a bit shy. The stock bounced after a 6.1% tumble on Wednesday, in the wake of rival rail transportation company CSX Corp.&apos;s disappointing results. Net income rose to $1.57 billion, or $2.22 a share, from $1.51 billion, or $1.98 a share, in the year-ago period. The FactSet consensus for EPS was $2.15. Total revenue slipped 1% to $5.60 billion, below the FactSet consensus of $5.64 billion, as energy revenue fell more than expected, while premium and agricultural revenue topped expectations and industrial revenue was in line. Total freight revenue fell 2%, as lower volumes offset pricing gains. The stock has gained 19.0% year to date through Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Transportation Average  has advanced 13.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has hiked up 16.7%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9dee0069-a292-310c-8139-496314079382/union-pacific%26apos%3Bs-stock.html?.tsrc=rss

Better-than-expected results from big bank stocks like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) are fueling ongoing buying interest as the latest earnings season rolls on.This comes despite the ongoing flow of uneven economic data. U.S. industrial production slowed in the second quarter for the first back-to-back decline since 2016. Freight shipments, according to the Cass Index, fell for the seventh straight month. Yet retail sales are strong.With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates later this month, likely fueling another surge in buying interest, I've noticed a number of transportation stocks perking up. This could be an early sign that the market is pricing in an economic rebound, since these companies are on the front lines of the business cycle, moving the people and the goods that make the system work.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Here are five transportation stocks that are worth a look: Transportation Stocks to Buy: Union Pacific (UNP)Shares of Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) are breaking up and out of a multi-month consolidation range to push back towards the highs seen in May. Shares were recently initiated with a buy rating at Goldman Sachs, with a $198 price target translating into a gain of roughly 13% from here.The company will next report results on July 18 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.14 per share on revenues of $5.6 billion. When the company last reported on April 18, earnings of $1.93 beat estimates by six cents on a 1.7% decline in revenues. CSX (CSX)Shares of CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), another railroad, are preparing to exit a four-month consolidation range with a push up and over resistance near the $80-a-share level. Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently initiated coverage with a neutral rating and a $86 price target, but Loop Capital recently downgraded from &quot;buy&quot; to &quot;neutral.&quot;  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy The company will next report results tonight after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.11 per share on revenues of $3.1 billion. When the company last reported on April 16, earnings of $1.02 per share beat estimates by 11 cents on a 4.8% rise in revenues. FedEx (FDX)FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock is rising up and off of support going back to late December, perking up and over its 50-day moving average. Watch for a run at the 200-day moving average, which would be worth a gain of roughly 8% from here. Analysts at Goldman recently initiated coverage with a &quot;buy&quot; rating and added the stock to its conviction buy list.The company will next report results on Sept. 17 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.18 per share on revenues of $17.1 billion. When the company last reported on June 25, earnings of $5.01 beat estimates by 18 cents on a 2.8% rise in revenues. UPS (UPS)UPS (NYSE:UPS) shares have cleared above their 200-day moving average for the first time since April, and are now threatening to break out of a churning, two-year downtrend with a move back towards $118 -- which would be worth a gain of more than 11% from here. The stock also had coverage initiated by Goldman analysts this month, with a buy rating and a target of $123 assigned.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond The company will next report results on July 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.93 per share on revenues of $17.9 billion. When the company last reported on April 25, earnings of $1.39 missed estimates by four cents on a 0.3% rise in revenues. Delta Airlines (DAL)Shares of Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) are taking flight, going vertical after breaking up and over resistance from its November and April highs. This ends a two-year funk going back to early 2018 as the company -- which tops customer satisfaction surveys in a tough industry -- continues to execute well. The airline has been able to avoid the disruptions tied to the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, since it didn't operate that model.The company will next report results on Oct. 10 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.26 per share on revenues of $12.7 billion.

2019-07-12	2019-07-12 17:41:57	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Going Into Earnings, Approach CSX Stock With Caution	CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX)  is slated to report its earnings on Tuesday after the closing bell. Analysts who follow CSX stock, on average, expect the company's earnings and revenue to rise year-over-year.Source: Shutterstock CSX  has benefited from tremendous growth, especially over the last three years. But given the economic headwinds the company could face going forward, the railroad could see its bull run end and partially reverse course. Although CSX stock should serve investors well over the long-term, they should probably avoid buying it ahead of the  company's earnings.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond  CSX's Earnings, Revenue Likely IncreasedAnalysts on average forecast that the Jacksonville, Florida-based rail company earned $1.11 per share of CSX stock in the second quarter. If the company meets that estimate, that means its EPS  rose nearly 10% year-over-year. Analysts' consensus Q2 top-line estimate is $3.16 billion, a 1.7% increase from the $3.1 billion CSX reported in Q2 of 2018.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGiven these numbers and the performance of CSX in recent years, this company deserves more attention than it's gotten. Railroad stocks boomed in the 19th century, when they acted as the tech equities of their day. Today, cutting-edge tech looks much different, and rail transport typically does not generate much excitement. CSX stock is not the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock. However, investors should pay attention to this sector. CSX Offers Profit Growth and Dividend IncreasesIn early 2016, the CSX stock price stood at just over $21 per share. Today, CSX stock trades at over $77 per share. This rally has happened for the right reasons: rising profits and improving cash flows. As a result, the price-earnings (PE) ratio of CSX stock, which stood at around 13.5 a few years ago, has increased to about 18.8 now.Despite this still-low multiple, analysts, on average, expect CSX's profit to rise 13% this year and 9.7% in 2020. Both Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) offer slightly higher growth and have slightly higher PE ratios. Still, with these metrics, CSX stock looks like it will be a winner over the long-term.The company's track record has also been strong when it comes to its dividend. With a yield of about 1.25%, investors will probably not buy CSX stock for the payout. However, since 2005, the company has increased its dividend almost every year, making it very reliable in that area. Watch CSX's Forward GuidanceDespite the recent strength of CSX's results (or maybe because of it), investors should pay careful attention to its forward guidance. The current economic expansion has reached its 11th year. Moreover, the ongoing trade war with China could disrupt the raw material exports on which CSX depends.This might explain why the company provided lower than expected full-year revenue guidance in January. Further signs of slowing could end the bull run of CSX stock, which has benefited those who have owned the stock over the long-term. With its low costs compared to other types of freight, I expect rail transport to remain a fixture for a long time to come. However, I do not recommend buying this name going into earnings. The Bottom Line on CSX StockDespite the stellar performance of CSX stock, investors should take a cautious view of the equity going into earnings. CSX has beaten consensus earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters.  Consequently, I would expect its EPS to come in higher than the expected $1.11 per share.However, I think investors should focus on its guidance. In recent months, consensus expectations for its annual revenue growth has dropped from high-single-digit-percentage levels to the low-single-digits. In light of the current economic conditions, CSX could cut its guidance further.I do not think the company's results will change the long-term bull case on CSX stock. Trading at roughly 18 times  earnings and delivering (almost) double-digit-percentage EPS growth, CSX remains reasonably priced. However, since the equity could easily drop from these levels, I think traders should stay on the sidelines on CSX stock for now.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-07-05	2019-07-05 14:53:24	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	CSX Stock Is Finally Due for A Correction After Its Massive Climb	CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) stock has been on a tear over the past few years. Shares in the railroad stock are up approximately 27% year-to-date. With strong operating margins, favorable economic conditions and a history of disciplined capital allocation, CSX stock has been a solid name to own for the past decade.Source: Shutterstock But with shares treading between $75 and $80 per share since April, will investors see a continued increase in the CSX stock price? While there are few red flags at the moment, a cooling U.S. economy may mean an end to continued earnings growth.Read on to see why CSX Corp may be sell for now:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips CSX Continues to Squeeze Out Earnings GrowthFor Q1 2019, revenues rose 5% from Q1 2018. With the company able to keep costs constant, operating income rose 17%. Revenue increases from transporting agricultural/food products, forest products, chemicals and coal offset declining intermodal transport revenues.Thanks to price increases, the company was able to generate revenue growth from flat volume. This indicates that while CSX (like the other Class I railroads) have been able to increase revenue per unit, it could be a sign that the company has reached the limit in terms of revenue growth.But the company has a strong track record of maintaining low operating costs. Among the Class I railroads, CSX has the lowest operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenue).  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice With additional layoffs expected in 2019, CSX may be able to bring down costs further. This means even with projections of low single-digit revenue growth, the company could continue to produce satisfactory earnings growth. CSX Stock Price Vulnerable to Coal DemandBased on a May 2019 investor presentation, coal makes up 19% of the company's revenues. Coal revenues for Q1 2019 were up 7% year-over-year.Continued reduction in coal demand could materially impact the CSX stock price. With the EIA's short-term energy outlook showing continued consumption declines (567 million short tons in 2020, down from 687 million in 2018), this trend does not show any signs of reversing.The counter to this is heavy demand from the domestic steel industry. International demand for American coal exports also helps to support the railroad's coal business. But any negative impact to these customer bases (downturn in economy hurting steel demand, reduced global use of coal) would affect the company's revenue. CSX Trades at Similar Valuation Levels to PeersCSX stock currently trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 19.25, and a forward P/E of 16.46. There is little variance between its valuation, and the valuation of its peers:  * Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI): 16.13 trailing P/E, 18.04 forward P/E  * Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU): 21.63 trailing P/E, 16.34 forward P/E  * Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC): 20.04 trailing P/E, 16.52 forward P/E  * Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP): 21.01 trailing P/E, 16.79 forward P/EHigh operating margins and a strong economy have allowed these old-line companies to achieve fairly high valuations. But with a 10-year long bull market due for a correction, is it smart to get into CSX stock today? Despite a maxed out valuation, thanks to smart capital allocation, the company could continue to drive returns to shareholders. Disciplined Capital Allocation a Strong Catalyst for CSX Stock PriceWhile CSX's valuation appears stretched, its disciplined capital allocation continues to be a strong catalyst. Based on statements from the investor presentation mentioned earlier, the company practices asset efficiency when it comes to capital expenditures.The company's focus is on identifying capital investments that generate sufficient returns, as well as right-sizing their locomotive and car fleet. This has paid off, as CSX is able to move almost all of their net income down to the free cash flow line.In 2018, the company reported a 97% conversion of net income to FCF. Management believes they can move this further, with a projected 2019 FCF conversion ratio of 99%.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 This means more money for buybacks. The company bought back $5.4 billion worth of shares in 2018, and has approved a buyback program for $5 billion more in 2019.While the dividend yield is not high (1.22%), CSX has increased its dividend about 10% per year for the past decade. A low yield may reduce interest from income investors, but the share buyback strategy is a smart way to deliver value to shareholders.Share buybacks are a more tax efficient means to return capital. They also boost the company's earnings-per-share, a benefit for the CSX stock price. Bottom Line: Do Not Expect CSX Stock to OutperformCSX has seen a tremendous run in the past ten years. Shares have risen from ~$11/share in July 2009 to nearly $80 per share today. But with the U.S. economy cooling down, CSX's valuation continuing to be higher-than-normal, and conservative growth prospects, it is unlikely investors will see similar returns going forward.But for a long-term investor, the stock may be a buy. The company's strong FCF conversion ratio enable it to continue an aggressive buyback strategy. Coupled with continued dividend growth, and the stock may provide sufficient returns. But as a short-term investment? Look elsewhere.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

House Bill 2209 requires railroads owning or operating routes for trains carrying highly hazardous materials to have oil spill contingency plans that have been approved by Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oregon-passes-bill-requiring-oil-155231573.html?.tsrc=rss

The Dow transports were led lower by shares of railroad operators Norfolk Southern Corp. , down 1.4%; Union Pacific Corp. , which was 1.3% lower; and Southwest Airlines Co. , which fell 1.2%. Earlier, the Empire State manufacturing index for June posted the largest-ever drop into negative territory, despite expectations of a positive reading, while the National Association of Home Builders' index of home builder confidence fell 2 points to 64 in June, missing expectations of a 1-point increase. That led the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to decline 0.7 basis points to 2.086%. Many on Wall Street view the Dow transports as a proxy on economic growth. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 57 points, or 0.2%. The broader market may be boosted by expectations that the Federal Reserve will confirm this week that recent data supports the notion that the next rate move will be down.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8ae1715b-1def-3103-885b-f1c34db68e37/dow-transports-drop-to-buck.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-06-14	2019-06-14 17:17:33	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Pricing Changes Could Hurt CSX Stock	Two months ago, the owners of CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) stock were cheering. Despite tepid demand for rail-freight service, what the company described as a &quot;broad-based&quot; pricing increase led to a respectable 5% year-over-year increase in its top line in the first quarter. CSX stock price jumped 4% in one day, reaching new record highs in the process.Source: Shutterstock Not all of CSX's apparent pricing power, however, may actually be pricing power. Indeed, it may not be sustainable. Its customers are not only balking, but they're slowly abandoning CSX and turning to the trucking industry instead, despite its rising cost.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Expects to Soar for the Rest of 2019 More than anything though, rail customers are turning to regulators, who so far have been seemingly sympathetic to the complaints about the railroad industry's rising fees.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Customers Subsidizing Railroads' PSR WorkThe acronym &quot;PSR,&quot; short for precision-scheduled railroading, sounds like a brilliant cost-culling idea. And, with the advent of wireless communications, PSR is now a very real possibility that the owners of CSX stock as well as Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) shareholders have understandably cheered.Rail customers aren't cheering though, as much of the burden of adopting PSR has fallen, some say unfairly, on them.Case in point: Customers of many PSR-guided railroads are now charged fees if their freight isn't unloaded immediately after its arrival, rather than after the customer has had a reasonable amount of time to remove it. In some cases the customer may lack the necessary capacity to immediately unload its freight. In other cases, the rail yard itself may be the source of the bottleneck.Regardless of the reason, many rail-freight users feel unfairly rushed by the system.Moreover, at a two-day hearing that took place in late May, several railroad customers lodged official complaints about the issue with the Surface Transportation Board.The STB has the authority to step in, if need be. It can't outright control market  shipping rates, but it does wield a great deal of influence on pricing, and it can put in place new rules that give rail customers the right to charge railroads fees when they are the source of the tie-up.Perhaps more alarming is the fact that the usually-aloof Surface Transportation Board has already become notably vocal on this particular matter. STB board member Martin Oberman commented at the recent meeting &quot;What we're being told is it's an incentive to make you move faster. What it sounds like is it's an incentive for you to stop using the railroad.&quot;He added &quot;You cannot be incentivized to roll time backwards.&quot; Waning Rail DemandIf the owners of CSX stock aren't concerned, they should be. These added fees are a key reason the carrier has been able to grow its top and bottom lines so well of late.Demand for rail services to-date this year is better than it was at this point a year ago, but that's a dubious victory. Usage of railroads last year in the United States was well below the levels of 2016 and 2017â², and this year's demand is also weaker than at the same time in 2016 and 2017.There's been no place to hide in the railroad sector. Demand for intermodal as well as for railcars is slumping, and total demand for rail-freight services is just as weak in Canada and Mexico.And the PSR-driven fees - high margin fees at that - aren't insignificant. Last year, fees  accounted for more than 40% of CSX's  7.5% top-line growth.If the STB pushes back, the impact could prove to be problematic. The Bottom Line on CSX StockIt's certainly possible, of course, that the Surface Transportation Board is offering more lip service than planned relief for railroad customers.It's not an agency to be toyed with, however. It's got teeth, and it's not afraid to use them.And it may about to do just that. In a report provided to the STB in April by a task force charged with reviewing rail-rate oversight, the direction that pricing matters are going is clear. That is, major changes in pricing methods are being recommended to the board.It remains to be seen just how much the Surface Transportation Board will intercede, or if it will recognize that unreasonable fees are just a means of charging higher rates without labeling them a &quot;rate increase,&quot;As Palmer Logistics President Brett Mears noted last month, though, &quot;I do think that the STB will continue with the investigation phase and ultimately will invoke rule making to relieve the burden to industry after overwhelming response to this hearing.&quot;That should at least concern anyone who owns CSX stock.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Similar remarks came from the White House in April, but with a one-year time frame to take measures to stem illegal immigration into the U.S.  Eroding freight fundamentals have been attributed to general economic malaise, the other trade war (China) and tough year-over-year comparisons from a record 2018 freight demand environment.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spindly-transport-stocks-dealt-another-164744666.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-04-26	2019-04-26 14:25:22	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	5 Stocks That the Smart Money Likes	Investors looking for the best stocks are wise to try to follow the smart money. From that standpoint, the portfolios of fund managers with strong track records can be fertile ground for picking stocks.After all, the best portfolio managers may have different strategies and different specialties. But those who can beat the market over time have proven that their respective approaches are based on sound logic and an understanding of what moves markets.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy Now To be sure, even the best stock pickers don't always get it right. But they do more often than not. These five stocks all have support from some of the market's best minds and some of its smartest money. That alone suggests the rest of us should take a long look.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Warren Buffett has built a well-deserved reputation as the &quot;Oracle of Omaha&quot; as he's built Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) into one of the world's most valuable companies. And while the touch of Buffett and Charlie Munger might not be as deft as they once were and Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are handling some of the company's investments, the market still wisely sees Berkshire as the smart money.And Buffett and Berkshire continue to see U.S. bank stocks as undervalued. Berkshire added to its positions in both Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) in the fourth quarter. That's in addition to large existing stakes in Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).With Goldman stock up big this year and Wells Fargo still scandal-ridden, the emphasis on adding JPM and BAC makes some sense. I personally have long argued that BAC and JPM are the two best stocks among U.S. big banks, and it's good to know that Buffett and Berkshire agree. Union Pacific (UNP)Morningstar tracks a group of managers that have historically beat the market with its Ultimate Stock-Pickers Index. The No. 1 purchase by that group, as of November, was railroad operator Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP).Those managers look awfully smart. UNP stock has skyrocketed to start 2019, with the appointment of a new COO kicking off the rally last month. The stock now has gained 27% in this year alone.But the rally may not be over. Union Pacific stock is hardly expensive, trading at 17 times 2019 earnings-per-share estimates. A 2% dividend adds income as well.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy Now Macro weakness is the big risk here -- lower economic growth means fewer products to ship -- but Union Pacific has managed through tough times before. Over the long-term, UNP has been a substantial outperformer and one of the best stocks in the market. The backing of smart money suggests that should continue, even with UNP near all-time highs. Apple (AAPL)The No. 2 stock on Morningstar's list is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Indeed, Apple's attractiveness to the smart money seemed to peak in October and November. Berkshire long has owned AAPL, but in November, hedge funds turned from net sellers to net buyers in Apple stock.That pivot was a bit early. AAPL would plunge in early January after cutting fiscal Q1 guidance. But the stock has rallied since, and strong institutional ownership persists.I personally remain skeptical; AAPL is cheap, yet worries about the iPhone can't be ignored. But a number of successful investors see it differently. Kraft Heinz (KHC)The smart money likes a turnaround on the cheap, and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) certainly qualifies. In late December, KHC stock touched its lowest point since the 2015 merger. Not coincidentally, the stock was a hedge fund favorite in the fourth quarter.There's a case for KHC near its lows. Changing customer tastes and private-label competition have pressured results of late. And there's quite a bit of debt on the balance sheet. Still, Kraft Heinz has dozens of hugely valuable brands, and remains a tough competitor worldwide.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy Now Indeed, I called KHC a fallen angel stock to buy in January, and I still believe that's the case. It may take some time for Kraft Heinz to turn around, and that process will require some patience from investors. Anyone buying KHC can at least know that more than a few professional stock-pickers will be waiting with them.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-25	2019-04-25 16:09:51	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	3 Stocks to Trade After Earnings	The earnings wave rolled on this week. Some stocks were left battered in its wake while others were lifted to lofty heights. I've sifted through the winners and losers to discover the best stocks to buy.Today I'll share my findings.When a company scores an outsized earnings gap higher after dazzling the Street, the euphoria tends to linger. And why shouldn't it? If the business was able to smash expectations and is performing better-than-expected, shouldn't that continue to bode well for its share price over the coming quarter?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIndeed.It's a common phenomenon that some refer to as PEAD or post-earnings announcement drift. To position ourselves to profit from the additional upside in the coming weeks, we're going to toss out trade ideas.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years Behold, three stocks to buy after earnings.      Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim  Twitter (TWTR)Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) tops our list of stocks to buy for a good reason. Its earnings gap was the most powerful and arguably has the best probability of scoring follow through.This week's 15% pole vault after its quarterly report was a gamechanger. It lifted the TWTR stock out of its nine-month trading range and finally conquered a critical resistance zone that has been frustratingly strong for ages. Given the magnitude of the jump as well as the groundswell in volume, I suspect Tuesday's breakout was the real deal.That doesn't mean the stock won't pull back. It just means the dip is a buy.Implied volatility is high enough to support selling puts for June. In doing so, you will obligate yourself to buy shares of TWTR at lower prices -- if the stock drops. If it doesn't, you'll simply keep the premium received at trade inception as compensation your willingness.Sell the June $35 puts for 60 cents.  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim  eBay (EBAY)Yesterday's 5% rally in eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) ushered the stock to the brink of a breakout. While the gains stopped short of fresh highs, I like its chances moving forward.EBAY stock's technical posture remains bullish and healthy. It now sits atop all major moving averages and may need a few days of churn before finally powering through the near-term ceiling. If it does, I think eBay has a date with $41.Given the post-earnings crush in implied volatility, call options are now decidedly cheaper than they were ahead of the event. To increase the odds, however, I like purchasing call spreads.  * 5 Hot Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Weather Heats Up Buy the July $38/$41 bull call spread for around $1.25.  Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim  Union Pacific (UNP)Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) rounds out today's selections with an earnings gap that sent it to record highs. Anytime the fundamentals of a company are powerful enough to push its share price to a level that has been hitherto unseen, it's noteworthy. And, it says something about just how robust the earnings growth has been.UNP is being weighed down this morning due to broader market weakness, but I think it's a gift.

2019-04-18	2019-04-18 19:58:52	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	5 Must-See Stock Charts for Monday: CGC, PINS, NVTA, UNP, BX	It's the same action that we've had for much of this week. Stocks press lower near the open only to recover by lunch and push higher in the afternoon. The gains aren't remarkable, but the bulls' resilience is something to take note of. The sector rotation underway also remains astounding. On that note, let's look at a few must-see stock charts for Monday.Remember, the U.S. markets are closed tomorrow for Good Friday. Must-See Stock Charts for Monday 1: InvitaeInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAbove is the daily chart for Invitae (NASDAQ:NVTA) and below is the weekly. This morning on Twitter, I pointed out that NVTA could post a sweet bounce, but I didn't think it would be this vicious.Shares ripped off of the 10-week and 50-day moving averages, gaining almost 8% from today's lows. This is definitely one to watch next week to see if the momentum can continue.I would have loved to buy NVTA at $21, but over $22 and NVTA could be primed for more upside. Must-See Stock Charts for Monday 2: BlackstoneBlackstone (NYSE:BX) delivered a strong earnings report and announced it will switch from a partnership to a corporation. Anyone ever own BX before? I have and waiting for a K-1 form that doesn't usually come until April is a pain the you-know-what. Switching to a corporation will make sense for the business and potentially make its stock more attractive to investors. Plus it has a monster yield.Could that cause a further breakout? Perhaps. Over $38 is encouraging for more upside, with long-term uptrend resistance not playing a role until the $40s. Below $38 and bulls may need to let BX reset. Above and it's okay. Must-See Stock Charts for Monday 3: Canopy GrowthAn explosive couple of days have put Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) back on the radar. But if the strong rally on Wednesday and Thursday proved anything to me, it's how tough of resistance $38 is.I'm watching CGC next week to see if the stock can pierce this level. If it can, it would be very bullish to see CGC find $38 as support. As long as it holds $44, CGC should be good on the long side. Must-See Stock Charts for Monday 4: Union PacificBetter than expected earnings propelled Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) to new 52-weeks high on Thursday. There sure are a lot of bearish calls out there despite so many names hitting new annual highs.Anyway, as long as UNP stock holds $160 next week, the bull case still looks strong. A pullback to the 10-week moving average that holds as support can be bought, while a run to channel resistance is possible over the intermediate term. Must-See Stock Charts for Monday 5: PinterestThe Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) IPOs got off to a much better start than Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) did, currently up 30% and 75% on the day, respectively.For investors, there a lot less volatile plays out there than these fresh IPOs. But if you have to play them, investors at least have the IPO day range to work with. A red-to-green open on Monday could draw in more buyers for PINS, while a push through the highs could ad even more momentum to the name.  * The Jobs Report Isn't an Effective Metric for the U.S. Economy If it's too short term for you, don't have any regrets about giving it more time to base.

2019-04-15	2019-04-15 12:55:32	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	FedEx Stock Is a Strong Buy Under $200	Just a year ago, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock was flying high, even reaching $270 per share at one point. Since then, however, FDX stock has been grounded. Economic concerns have investors fleeing FedEx and some other transportation stocks.However, not all transports have been hit equally. In fact, some of the rails, like Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) are making fresh 52-week highs. This sets up an interesting pair trade opportunity to sell the rails and buy the truck and air delivery service competitors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut first, what has gone wrong for Fedex stock? Slowing Economic OutlookOver the past three quarters, FedEx has lowered its FY '19 guidance from a starting point of $17.50 into the $16s, and now, of the latest update, just $15.50. That's an 11% decline for this year's outlook in a relatively brief period of time. The guidance range for Q4 remains fairly wide as well, suggesting that management is not confident on how this quarter will turn out.The company blamed several factors for the dramatic slowdown in the earnings outlook. The most important of these appears to be international markets. Non-U.S. revenues failed to come in like FedEx had been expecting. Regardless, management is still upbeat for fiscal year 2020, which kicks off in June of this year.  * 10 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now Some of this is hard to predict. The trade war, for example, has undoubtedly pressured FedEx's business. Many analysts still expect positive developments on this front within the next couple months. In fact, much of the recent stock market rally has been built on rumors that a China-U.S. deal is drawing near. However, FedEx's results could remain choppy for a bit until a more global economic upswing takes root. Big OverreactionThe crux of the matter here, however, is that the market has drastically overreacted. The company cut 2019 guidance by around 10% and the stock lost more than a third of its value. That's a highly disproportionate response to the news. That said, you can see why the market reacted this way. FedEx cut guidance each of the last two quarters, rather than delivering all the bad news at once, giving the impression that things are steadily worsening.Still, the overall magnitude of the drop shouldn't be exaggerated. On top of that, economic indicators should start picking up again. The Fed has pivoted from a strongly hawkish position back to neutral. Letting easier credit into the economy should help consumer confidence, and thus enable FedEx's business to pick up.It's also important to remember that FedEx has tremendous franchise value due to its powerful brand and entrenched infrastructural advantages. The value of the business doesn't swing 30% in a year simply because it delivers fewer packages. FDX stock is sharply overreacting to minor economic swings that most people will forget within a couple of years. Cheap Versus the RailsThe railroad stocks are looking rather expensive at the moment. Most of the sector is trading at or near new 52-week highs and sporting fairly lofty price-to-earnings ratios for a typically sedated sector. Canadian National Railway is at 21x trailing, 18x forward earnings, for example. Union Pacific is at 21x trailing and 17x forward earnings. CSX (NYSE:CSX) is at 20x and 16x, respectively. Against that backdrop, FDX stock really pops at 16x trailing and 12x forward earnings, and that's even after the stock rallied from $170 to $195 recently.It simply doesn't make a whole lot of sense intuitively that FedEx is doing so poorly while the rails are experiencing boom times. Sure, railroads tend to carry more commodity goods, whereas FedEx has more retail and consumer traffic. Still, though, as the economy goes, if consumers aren't buying as much stuff, the demand for raw commodities will drop as well. Transports tend to trade together as a sector; it's unlikely that FedEx stock can continue to drastically underperform the rails for long.  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy as Oil Booms Bears on FDX stock can make one counterargument to this line of reasoning. FedEx acquired TNT Express in 2016, which greatly enhanced its market presence in Europe. The European economy remains among the weakest of the major developed players in the world. You can argue that FedEx is unduly struggling due to its heightened European exposure. That said, the rails have exposure to other economies as well, particularly Canada and China, which are not so hot right now either. It hardly seems fair to blame FedEx's underperformance on non-U.S. exposure. FDX Stock VerdictI personally started buying FDX stock in January at $176 per share, and I've added to my position since then. While another correction to that level would set up an amazing opportunity to take a position in this global freight leader, the current price is still more than fair.FDX stock should trade at $250 or higher based on both comparable earnings of other transportation companies and where FDX stock traded last year. Yes, there was a brief recession scare late last year. But it's over now and the Fed has reopened the cheap money taps again. Don't miss your chance to get on-board with FDX stock before it makes a full recovery.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned FDX stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

2019-03-20	2019-03-20 18:23:39	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	10 Companies With New or Improved Stock Buybacks in 2019	Stock buybacks crashed through the ceiling in 2018. Companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index alone announced plans to repurchase almost $1 trillion in shares - a tactic that not only makes the remaining stock worth a little more, but improves per-share financial metrics in their quarterly reports.Generous corporate tax cuts took hold in 2018, making it easy for many of the nation's businesses - which already were flush with cash - to pull the trigger. The same business-friendly tax environment could make 2019 another strong year for stock buybacks.Eclipsing last year's tally would require continued economic growth, of course, although not even a nagging tariff war appears to be a problem for capitalism just yet. Inflation is being held in check, too, and the Federal Reserve is leaning dovish, so few landmines lie ahead. The only plausible threat to buyback mania to date is legislation aimed at crimping excessive stock repurchases. Even then, the idea has minimal support and could take until at least 2020 to put in place if approved.In other words, the environment is right for 2019 to be another strong year for share repurchases. In fact, several organizations have already made their announcements. Here are 10 companies that have initiated or increased stock buybacks just since the beginning of the year.

### NYSE:UNP

View full report here!

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is positive 
  * ETFs holding this stock have seen outflows over the last one-month 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for UNP with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting UNP.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Negative

ETF activity is negative. Over the last one-month, outflows of investor capital in ETFs holding UNP totaled $24.86 billion. Additionally, the rate of outflows appears to be accelerating.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Negative

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Industrials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Positive

The current level displays a positive indicator. UNP credit default swap spreads are near the lowest level of the last one year and indicate improvement in the market's perception of the company's credit worthiness.

2019-01-30	2019-01-30 20:21:15	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	5 Dividend Stocks to Help You Through the Marketâs Mayhem	"Unless you've been living under a rock, you know the markets haven't been sailing smoothly lately. A variety of issues -- from the trade war to the government shutdown -- have made investors nervous. And with those nerves have come plenty of volatility and big swings. For investors -- especially those near retirement -- the volatility can cause plenty of restless nights. But there is a way to get over the malaise.

And that's dividend stocks.

The steady stream of payments from dividend stocks can act as some ballast in the rough seas. After all, if you're already getting a 3 to 4% return in cash, market swings may not matter as much. Moreover, reinvested dividends can provide an extra boost when the markets return to gains once again. All in all, dividend stocks can be a portfolios best friend in markets like these. The question is which dividend stocks to buy.

High yield isn't everything. It takes a certain combination of payout growth and current yield that makes a dividend stock great. And with that, here are five dividend stocks that are perfect for the market's current situation.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: Simon Property Group (SPG)

Dividend Yield: 4.46%

If you read the headlines, traditional brick & mortar retail is dying a quick death. However, that simply isn't the case. Retail in non-prime areas is suffering. Those malls, power centers and shopping plazas in high-income, growing areas are thriving. And one of the best dividend stocks of the all hones in on these areas.

Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is one of the largest mall operators around -- with hundreds of properties across North America, Europe, and Asia. After a spinout a few years ago -- before online shopping really took off -- Simon became focused strictly on A or Prime retail space. Because of that focus, occupancy is a high 95% and SPG has continued to see record sales/cash flows from its tenants. Last quarter alone, its tenants saw a big 4.5% increase in their retail sales per square foot.

This has translated in a big jump for the dividend stock's cash flows and net income.

For investors in SPG stock, its meant a long history of dividend payouts and increases. Since the recession, SPG has managed to increase its dividend by over 230%. And with the continue record results and focus on upper-income areas, those increases will continue.

With a current yield of 4.45%, Simon Property could be a wonderful dividend stock to help surf the tide of market volatility.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: Union Pacific Corporation (UNP)

Dividend Yield: 2.0%

Monopolies are great for investors. And one of few legal monopolies left in the world happens to be the railroads. That's great news for dividend stocks in the sector like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP).

UNP happens to have the largest rail networks in the U.S. But perhaps, more importantly, that rail network connects all the major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to eastern gateways as well as connects to Canada's rail system and is the only railroad serving all six major Mexico gateways. It literally covers all of North America. That's a great place to be as other railroads need to pay UNP to use its system. Even better has been the fact that the economy has improved.

Because of this, volumes across the board have continued to rise at the railroad. And with some moves to reduce waste, improve reliability and lower taxes, UNP saw a whopping 29% increase to its per-share net income for the full year 2018. Naturally, these continued profits have resulted in a strong set of dividend increases and rich buyback program.

And while investors may get nervous because UNP is an economic play, the dividend stocks low payout ratio of 41% provides plenty of cushion for its payout.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: Apple (AAPL)

Dividend Yield: 1.89%

A lot of ink has been spilled on the state of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), slowing iPhone sales and perhaps the lack of recent innovation at the company. And those are all valid concerns. But looking at Apple through a different lens may be helpful. The reality is, AAPL may not be a &quot;growth stock&quot; anymore and that's alright for income seekers.

Apple still sells a lot of products, but the real driver last quarter was its strong services and cloud product portfolio. Like many former tech darlings -- think Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) -- Apple is shifting its resources to the cloud. And so far, the results have been impressive. During its latest results, Tim Cook mentioned that cloud services revenue was up 40% year-over-year and the number of Apple Pay transactions more than doubled to 1.8 billion. This very important and shows that even though iPhone growth has slowed, Apple can still keep the cash flows coming as users start using apps like Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud.

And speaking of that cash, Apple still managed to end the quarter with more than $245 billion on its balance sheet. That's a staggering amount of money and provides plenty of runway for Apple to develop new gear, pay dividends and even buy opportunities through M&A.

With a P/E of under 13 and 1.89%, Apple is cheap and now represents a big value. Looking at it like as you would dividend stocks, there's a lot to like.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: Medtronic (MDT)

Dividend Yield: 2.31%

One of the best places to find dividend stocks is the healthcare sector. Demand tends to be steady in all sorts of market environments and that allows many healthcare firms to be strong dividend payers. And you can't get much strong that Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). MDT has now been paying a steady and increasing dividend for over 40 years.

Since producing a wearable pacemaker back in the 1950s, Medtronic has become a juggernaut in the field and now offers a variety of medical appliances that hospitals need every day. This includes some very high-tech solutions to well everyday items. As a result, sales at MDT continue to be robust. The medical-device firm managed to pull in just under $30 billion in total sales last year. Increasingly, it's been turning those sales into higher profits as it devotes more time to higher-margined, higher-tech devices. New A.I. diabetes monitors and pain stimulation devices are now on the menu.

For investors, all of these sales and better margins have continued to help the firm's dividend growth and buyback programs. Over the last five years, the focus on higher-margined goods has allowed MDT to see annual dividend growth of 12%. Medtronic has a current yield of 2.31%.

With healthcare demand only increasing and a huge portfolio of must-have devices, Medtronic investors stand to profit over the long haul and during the current market meltdown.

### Dividend Stocks To Buy: United Technologies Corporation (UTX)

Dividend Yield: 2.49%

What global slowdown? That's exactly what investors in United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) are asking themselves after the firm's last results. The results were splendid and showed plenty of growth. All in all, UTX managed to pull in more than $66 billion in total sales and see a huge 29% jump in its full-year profits.

Driving that has been United Technologies new forays into the &quot;connected aerospace&quot; sector and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). With software now joining traditional jet engines, margins at the firm have continued to jump. That's resulted in a big boost to profitability and 5% increase to its dividend.

But the story at UTX isn't just about last quarter. It's about the future. And that's because the firm is planning on separating into three different stocks. One will cover the fast-growing aerospace market, the other two with cover Otis Elevators/infrastructure products and heating, cooling and building automation.

For those investors looking for dividend stocks, this is great news. One stock will have a smaller yield, but potentially faster dividend growth, while the other two will larger initial yields and steadier profits. Buying UTX today gets you a whole portfolio's worth of dividend investing styles tomorrow. Meanwhile, you're paid to wait with UTX's current 2.49% yield and great profit profile.

Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the stocks mentioned.

### NYSE:UNP

View full report here!

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is neutral 
  * ETFs holding this stock have seen outflows over the last one-month 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for UNP with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting UNP.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Negative

ETF activity is negative. Over the last one-month, outflows of investor capital in ETFs holding UNP totaled $2.00 billion. Additionally, the rate of outflows appears to be accelerating.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Negative

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Industrials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Neutral

The current level displays a neutral indicator. UNP credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels of the last 3 years, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, CSX's OR was 60.3 percent, which is a 400 basis point improvement over the 60.7 percent posted in the fourth quarter of 2017.  The outlook for 2019 that was to be delivered later Wednesday afternoon on the earnings call by CEO James Foote calls for the full year 2019 operating ratio to outperform the target of 60 percent that was set for 2020.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-look-csx-reports-softer-153642959.html?.tsrc=rss

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is neutral 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for UNP with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting UNP.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Neutral

ETF activity is neutral. The net inflows of $12.53 billion over the last one-month into ETFs that hold UNP are not among the highest of the last year and have been slowing.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Negative

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Industrials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Neutral

The current level displays a neutral indicator. UNP credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels of the last 3 years, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

2019-01-14	2019-01-14 18:17:24	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	10 Companies That Could Post Decelerating Profits	"Typically, the holiday season presents a joyous moment for the markets on a substantive basis. With businesses borrowing money to ramp up for manic shoppers, the fourth quarter is the chance to deliver the goods. But with the upcoming earnings reports, investors should probably brace for disappointing results.

According to the latest report from The Wall Street Journal, a string of downgraded profitability expectations has worried analysts. Prior headwinds that began to impact sentiment last year, unfortunately, stuck around longer than corporate leaders anticipated. Further, few indicators suggest that the markets can rise above the doldrums anytime soon.

Primarily, the upcoming earnings reports mostly have a China problem. The ongoing trade war between the top two economies in the world have rattled both corporate executives and shareholders. An initial thawing in relations turned out to be a head-fake when controversies like the Huawei arrest returned an icy chill to the narrative.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

On a related note, the trade war throws more variables into an already unstable geopolitical environment. Other countries besides the U.S. must respond to the changing circumstances. Moreover, President Trump hasn't done a great job solidifying relationships with our allies. As a result, friendly nations have the potential of becoming economic rivals, further pressuring upcoming earnings reports.

Finally, poor timing hurts Wall Street. Over the last few years, the benchmark indices have enjoyed record-breaking growth. But the tailwind that we're the best block in the worst neighborhood has died down. Now, investors seek substance. From their perspective, they're not getting it, adding to the overall bearishness.

  * InvestorPlace Roundup: The Hottest Stocks in the Market Today 



Naturally, almost every company is absorbing some pain. Here are ten upcoming earnings reports that are at risk for posting decelerating profits:

### Bank of America (BAC)

No matter what the situation is for the economy or the investment sector, you must always pay attention to the big banks. As economic bellwethers, you can make a reasonable forecast on how Wall Street will perform based on their earnings reports.

Unless you're shorting the broader markets, Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) fourth-quarter 2018 earnings report will likely disappoint you. Originally slated for an earnings per share of 63 cents, BAC stock will be lucky if it gets anywhere close.

According to Investor's Business Daily, a host of problems -- including the challenges I mentioned above -- will pressure the banks. Currently, BAC stock has benefitted from higher interest rates and tax cuts. However, those factors have likely been baked into the share price.

At any rate, BofA's upcoming earnings report is extremely critical because it concentrates mostly in the U.S. Its performance could make or break other companies.

### Morgan Stanley (MS)

Under any other circumstance, Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) upcoming earnings report suggests a high probability of success. The last time MS stock missed the mark was back in Q3 2015. Otherwise, shareholders can depend on an earnings beat, and usually a very strong one.

I'm not suggesting that MS stock will miss in Q4. However, it's a very real possibility. As is the case with BofA, one wonders how long the low-hanging fruit can sustain Morgan Stanley. Especially in a deflated environment, investors want to hear more than just &quot;tax cuts&quot; or &quot;interest rates.&quot;

  * 10 Key Emerging-Market Stocks to Buy for Contrarian Investors 



Further, Morgan Stanley obviously features an extensive brokerage business. Even in a bull market, this is a challenging venture due to millennials not embracing equity investments. But with the major indices tanking like they have? The timing couldn't be worse.

### Apple (AAPL)

Speaking of low-hanging fruit, we've got to talk about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Among all upcoming earnings reports, AAPL stock levers the most influence in the global markets. When the vaunted consumer-electronics firm revealed that the trade war had hurt its iPhone sales, the Street responded poorly.

But I'm not here to harp on past disclosures. First, I want to know just how bad of a miss we're talking about and the greater context. I agree with InvestorPlace market strategist William Roth, who stated that CEO Tim Cook blaming China is a cop-out. As Roth put it, &quot;If you make an innovative product, Chinese consumers will buy it anyway.&quot;

And that's where my concern lies. Without Steve Jobs, Apple has lost its core catalyst, which only invites lurking competitors. Management better have a good story to tell. Otherwise, AAPL stock may have further to fall.

### Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)

Logically, if Apple is taking a turn for the worst, it follows that the company's suppliers will face similar distress. That's the case for Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS). Since the start of last year, SWKS stock has dropped an agonizing 26%.

Not surprisingly, Skyworks recently announced a guidance cut for its upcoming earnings report. Previously, management forecasted revenues between $1 billion to $1.02 billion, and EPS of $1.91. Now, the Apple parts supplier is looking at sales of $970 million, and EPS between $1.81 and $1.84.

More critically, I think we can expect SWKS stock to remain under pressure throughout most of this year. The concept of &quot;peak smartphone&quot; -- something that I've warned about years ago -- is finally impacting the markets. Unfortunately, companies like Skyworks rely on volume. If Apple and its competitors aren't driving unit sales, SWKS will need serious help.

### Union Pacific (UNP)

In recent years, railroad operator Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) has pleasantly surprised investors. Despite its rather archaic business, railroading represents a critical component of our transportation network. Additionally, this year looks like a favorable one for UNP stock thanks to a new executive hiring.

I'd use the enthusiasm to take profits off the company ahead of its upcoming earnings report. Since the October meltdown, UNP stock has gyrated wildly. More importantly, shares could take on a decidedly negative tone if Union Pacific fails to meet profitability expectations.

One of the biggest worries here is declining coal volumes. Despite President Trump's campaign rhetoric to bring back coal, that promise has fallen flat. According to Reuters, more coal plants closed their doors under Trump's first two years than former President Obama's first term.

I don't see this situation changing due to cleaner alternatives to coal. Without another sector to pick up the slack, UNP could disappoint among high-profile earnings reports.

### Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX)

In many ways, the trucking industry is a real-time bellwether for the underlying economy. Indeed, it could be more accurate than the big banks. After all, if consumers aren't buying goods, you'll see an equivalent decline in trucking demand.

If that's the case, the falling price for Knight-Swift Transportation (NYSE:KNX) shares isn't a great sign. Since the beginning of 2018, KNX stock has dropped more than 34%, which is an alarming figure. In addition, the U.S. has likely reached maturity in trucking demand.

This sets up an interesting situation ahead of the transportation giant's upcoming earnings report. According to industry data, last year saw a record in freight-hauling demand. We're probably not going to see a repeat performance considering the trade war and other retail headwinds. Therefore, I'd stay on the sidelines for KNX stock.

### J B Hunt Transport Services (JBHT)

Among upcoming earnings reports, I'm worried most about transportation. In other sectors, particularly banking, you can fudge the numbers to present the best possible image. But with transportation, it's a binary reality: either you're moving products, or you're not.

The problems that Knight-Swift is facing is not unique to the company. Another big name in the arena, J B Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT), is also taking it in the chin. While JBHT stock had a relatively strong start to 2018, the October selloff really hurt the organization. Over the past three-and-a-half months, shares have tanked more than 18%.

A major headwind that hurts the transportation industry's future earnings reports is recruitment. Simply put, nobody wants to be a truck driver. Therefore, to keep the drivers JBHT and its competitors have, they must provide incentives.

Trucking is one of the rare job markets where the employees make the rules. However, that doesn't do favors for JBHT stock in terms of profitability.

### Caterpillar (CAT)

Out of the major earnings reports set for release, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has hit the most branches from the ugly tree. CAT stock never gained traction last year as the markets absorbed increasingly bearish news. This year, the iconic industrial giant doesn't have many options to exercise.

Primarily, the trade war represents the most worrying impediment. A recent report from Singapore Business Review indicated that China's construction industry will expand nearly 6% this year. If true, that's a lost opportunity that CAT stock can ill afford. Ironically, management has its staunch supporter President Trump to thank.

  * Mizuho: 7 Long-Term Value Stocks to Buy Now 



The former real-estate mogul and reality-TV star also boasted about &quot;building the wall.&quot; We're now in a dubiously unprecedented government shutdown because of this contentious issue. From Caterpillar's perspective, the wall is a pipe dream. This hurts longer-term prospects, casting a cloud on the upcoming earnings reports.

### DR Horton (DHI)

The crazy real-estate market probably won't impact homebuilder DR Horton's (NYSE:DHI) upcoming earnings report. But that doesn't give investors justification to dismiss the problems brewing over the horizon.

Over the past two years, housing prices have gone ballistic. This is especially the case for popular destination regions like Southern California. At one point, you could find affordable homes thanks to the recovery phase from the Great Recession. Today, even the cheap homes are out of reach for average income earners.

That's a huge problem for DHI stock, particularly because its core industry has a demographic problem. Most millennials were too young to participate in the housing discount shortly after the 2008 crisis. But just as they were about to pull the trigger, prices skyrocketed. This dynamic has created what Fortune's Shawn Tully called a &quot;lost generation&quot; of home buyers.

Essentially, housing's boom-bust cycles have created fiefdoms throughout America. While this setup benefits the rich, the wealth imbalance is bad news for DHI stock.

### Ford (F)

In our high school yearbook, my classmate and football teammate David wrote that between Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Chevy, it was no comparison -- you always went with Chevy.

As an immigrant, I must admit that I've always been confused why Americans buy American cars. To me, the Ford and Chevy debate is akin to choosing between lethal injection and the gas chamber. If at all possible, I'd rather have a third option.

Apparently, I'm not alone in my thinking process. After decades of disappointing sales that limited upside potential in F stock, management has mostly given up on cars. Moving forward, Ford will stick with what it does best: big trucks and SUVs.

I can see this as a recipe for nearer-term success. But if customer tastes change, not having the mainstay sedan is a deal-breaker for F stock in the long run.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Strong intermodal traffic growth

Union Pacificâs (UNP) rail traffic volumes rose 5.9% YoY to 139,243 units in the first week of 2019 driven mainly by strong growth in intermodal units. Its rail traffic gain was higher than the US railroad (IYT) companiesâ overall 4.8% gain during the same period.

During the week, Union Pacificâs intermodal traffic grew 8.8% YoY to 58,320 containers and trailers from 53,582 units in the same period of the previous year. The company moved 55,515 containers in the week compared to 51,007 containers in the same week in 2018. Moreover, the railroad companyâs trailer volumes expanded 8.9% YoY to 2,805 units compared to 2,575 units in Week 1 of 2018.

Union Pacificâs intermodal volume gain was the highest among all Class I railroad companies followed by Norfolk Southern (NSC), which reported 8.7% YoY gains. BNSF Railway, Canadian Pacific (CP), and CSX (CSX) reported a decline in intermodal traffic.

## Carload traffic

Union Pacificâs carload traffic increased 3.9% YoY in the first week. The company carried 80,923 railcars excluding intermodal units compared to 77,873 carloads in the same period last year. Commodities excluding coal and coke posted a 6.5% YoY increase in traffic to 60,671 railcars from 56,972 railcars. However, coal and coke traffic fell 3.1% YoY in Week 1 to 20,252 carloads from 20,901 carloads in the same week of 2018.

Commodities excluding coal and coke that reported notable volume growth in Week 1 included chemicals, grain, non-metallic minerals, petroleum products, and metal products. Commodities other than coal and coke that recorded YoY falls in volumes in Week 1 were metallic minerals, and motor vehicles and equipment.

Next, weâll discuss Canadian Pacificâs rail traffic performance.

2019-01-14	2019-01-14 13:06:22	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Analysts Predict Double-Digit Growth in Kansas Cityâs Q4 EPS	"Analysts Predict Double-Digit Growth in Kansas Cityâs Q4 EPS

## Fourth-quarter expectations

Kansas City Southern (KSU) is slated to report fourth-quarter results on January 18. For the quarter, Wall Street analysts project EPS to grow 13% YoY to $1.56, mainly driven by higher revenues and lower taxes. However, increased operating expenses are likely to partially offset the growth in bottom-line results.

Analysts forecast fourth-quarter revenues to increase ~5% YoY to $693.2 million mainly due to higher carload volumes. According to weekly rail traffic data released by the company, Kansas City Southern has reported improvement in volumes in almost every week of the fourth quarter. A strong economy has been driving rail traffic volumes.

Furthermore, the effective tax rate for the company is anticipated to be slightly lower than the year-ago quarter. For the upcoming quarter, analysts forecast the tax rate to come in at 29.5%, down from 32.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Nonetheless, rising operating expenses may negatively impact the companyâs bottom-line results. For the fourth quarter, analysts expect operating expenses to increase 4.9% YoY to $443.2 million.

## Full-year projections

For the full year, Wall Street analysts project the company to report EPS of $5.97, 13.7% higher than the $5.25 it earned in 2017. Revenue for the year is expected to increase 5% YoY to $2.7 billion, while tax rates are expected to come down to 29.1% from 33.5% in 2017.

The 2018 EPS of major US railroad companies (IYT) Union Pacific (UNP), Norfolk Southern (NSC), and CSX (CSX) are expected to increase 35.6%, 40%, 55%, respectively, on a YoY basis."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d4cd0a41-b6ff-365e-ba76-97d4a3f98da9/analysts-predict-double-digit.html?.tsrc=rss

## Fourth-quarter expectations

CSX (CSX) isÂ scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results on January 16. The US railroad company has an impressive record of beating analystsâ earnings estimates. The companyÂ beat analystsâ consensus estimates in all of the preceding four quarters with an average positive surprise of ~15%.

CSXÂ could continue its trend of reporting better-than-expected bottom-line results and witness strong double-digit quarterly earnings growth in the fourth quarter.Â CSX registered over 50% earnings growth in all of the preceding three quarters in 2018. For the fourth quarter, analysts expect an adjusted EPS of $0.99 for CSX, which implies a rise of ~55% YoY (year-over-year).

## Driving factors

Analysts expect higher revenues and implementing the PSR (Precision Scheduled Railroading) system to drive CSXâs fourth-quarter earnings higher. The reduced tax rate and lower outstanding sharesÂ could help the bottom-line results.

For the fourth quarter, the companyÂ expects toÂ report revenues of $3.13 billionâ9.3% higher than the same quarter the previous year. Strong single-digit revenue growth will likely be driven by higher volumes and increased pricing. According to rail traffic data released by the company on January 2, CSX carried 3% higher railcars during the fourth quarterâcomparedÂ to the same quarter the previous year. Carload and intermodal unitsÂ have seen their traffic increase 3.5% and 2.3% YoY.

The PSR principle helps railroad companies reduce network complexity and improve operational efficiency. Therefore, the implementation will likely reduce CSXâs operating expenses and improve the operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues). During the third quarter,Â the companyâs operating ratio improved to 58.7% from 68.4% in theÂ same quarter the previous year.

In the fourth quarter, the tax rate is projected to fall to 24.6% from 34.1% in the fourth-quarter of 2017 due to the enactment of the Tax CutsÂ and Jobs Act. Analysts expect the companyâs aggressive share buyback program to bring down the number of outstanding shares to ~840 million from 896 million in the same quarter the previous year.

## Fiscal 2018 expectations

For fiscal 2018, analysts expect the EPS to grow 66% YoY to $3.82Â due to higher revenues, improved operating efficiency, lower taxes, and reduced share counts. The revenues in fiscal 2018 will likely increase 7.2% YoY to $12.2 billion.

Major US railroads (IYT)Â including Union Pacific (UNP), Norfolk Southern (NSC), and Kansas City Southernâs (KSU) 2018 EPSÂ will likely increase 35.6%, 40%, 13.7%, respectively, on a YoY basis."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/39e4665d-9ddf-3d9b-a2ac-956223850fd0/csx%3A-cost-initiatives%2C-lower.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-01-14	2019-01-14 12:31:22	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Strong Carloads Drove Canadian Nationalâs Rail Traffic Higher	"US Railroads Kick-Start 2019 with Strong Traffic Growth

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Canadian Nationalâs rail traffic

Canadian National Railway (CNI) reported 9.3% YoY total traffic volume growth in the first week of 2019. The company moved 100,785 railcars compared to 92,235 wagons in Week 1 of 2018. The robust increase in carloads and intermodal units drove the railroad companyâs overall rail traffic in Week 52.

Canadian National was third in terms of traffic volume growth among all Class I railroad companies (IYT) in the week. Norfolk Southern (NSC) and CSX (CSX) were at the top two spots with YoY gains of 15.8% and 9.9%, respectively.

## Carloads and intermodal traffic

Canadian Nationalâs carload traffic grew 12.6% YoY to 60,011. The company remained the fourth-highest carload traffic gainer in Week 52 after Norfolk Southern, CSX, and BNSF Railwayâs gains of 24.4%, 18.4%, and 17.5%, respectively.

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Strong carload traffic growth

CSXâs (CSX) cumulative rail traffic rose 9.9% YoY to 98,954 units in Week 1 due to strong growth in its carloads. The company posted 18.4% YoY carload traffic growth in Week 1. CSX hauled 60,134 railcars excluding intermodal units in the week compared to 50,777 wagons in Week 1 of 2018.

Compared to US rail carriersâ overall 6.2% carload gains, CSXâs carload traffic saw much higher gains during the week. The companyâs carload traffic growth was the second highest among Class I railroad carriers (XLI) after Norfolk Southern (NSC), which witnessed a 24.4% increase in carload traffic in the first week.

CSXâs commodity group carloads except coal and coke accounted for 75% of its total carload traffic in the week. The companyâs coal and coke traffic made up the remaining 25% of its total carloads. The traffic of commodity groups excluding coal and coke grew 13.6% YoY in Week 1 to 44,979 railcars from 39,590 railcars. Moreover, coal and coke traffic jumped 35.5% YoY to 15,155 units from 11,187 units.

Commodities excluding coal and coke that reported remarkable volume growth in the first week included chemicals, grain, farm products, petroleum and petroleum products, metal products, and metallic ores. Commodities other than coal and coke that recorded a YoY fall in volumes in Week 1 were nonmetallic minerals and motor vehicles and parts.

## Intermodal units

During the first week of 2019, CSXâs intermodal unitsÂ fell 1.1% YoY. During the week, the company hauled 38,820 units compared with 39,243 units in Week 1 of 2018. Its container traffic inched down 1.3% YoY to 36,961 units in Week 1 from 37,439 units in Week 1 of 2018. However, trailer volumes for the week grew 3% YoY to 1,859 units from 1,804 units.

Apart from CSX, BNSF Railway and Canadian Pacific (CP) also registered a decline in their respective intermodal traffic. Union Pacific (UNP) was the top gainer with intermodal volume gains of 8.8%.

Next, weâll discuss Canadian Nationalâs rail traffic performance.

### NYSE:UNP

View full report here!

## Summary

  * Perception of the company's creditworthiness is neutral 
  * ETFs holding this stock are seeing positive inflows 
  * Bearish sentiment is low 
  * Economic output for the sector is expanding but at a slower rate



## Bearish sentiment

Short interest | Positive

Short interest is extremely low for UNP with fewer than 1% of shares on loan. This could indicate that investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting UNP.

## Money flow

ETF/Index ownership | Positive

ETF activity is positive. Over the last month, growth of ETFs holding UNP is favorable, with net inflows of $19.90 billion. This is among the highest net inflows seen over the last one-year and the rate of additional inflows appears to be increasing.

## Economic sentiment

PMI by IHS Markit | Negative

According to the latest IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, output in the Industrials sector is rising. The rate of growth is weak relative to the trend shown over the past year, however, and is easing.

## Credit worthiness

Credit default swap | Neutral

The current level displays a neutral indicator. UNP credit default swap spreads are near their highest levels of the last 3 years, which indicates the market's more negative perception of the company's credit worthiness.

2019-01-09	2019-01-09 12:32:18	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	3 Big Stock Charts for Wednesday: Anthem, ServiceNow and Hewlett Packard Enterprise	"At times it wasn't pretty, but by the time yesterday's closing bell rang, the S&P 500 was up a respectable 0.97% â¦ extending the recovery effort.

Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) did a great deal of the heavy lifting, gaining 8.8% after the hiring of Jim Vena as COO prompted several upgrades. Beyond that, though, the market's most familiar names didn't lend much of a helping hand. General Electric (NYSE:GE) fell a bit more than 2% as traders started to lock in recently won gains, while stalwart names like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) skipped out on the day's rally. The bulk of the S&P 500's progress was driven by the 90% of its constituents most traders never talk about.

That's not a bad thing though. Indeed, it's a good thing, as it means winners and losers are starting to separate themselves.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As Wednesday's action gets started, it's the stock charts of Anthem (NYSE:ANTM), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) that have laid out relatively clear paths for themselves. They all have just one more milestone to move past.

### Anthem (ANTM)

Losing ground on a day the market makes progress doesn't inherently mean a stock is in deep trouble, but it certainly doesn't bolster the bullish case â¦ particularly when the broad market logs a big win like it did yesterday. Bullish hope fades even more, though, when that pullback takes shape the way Tuesday's setback from Anthem took shape.

  * The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index 



The bulls might get one more shot at bringing ANTM stock back from the brink. The odds aren't looking good though, and one more misstep could spark a chain reaction of selling.

  
Click to Enlargeâ¢ The big red flag here is the way Anthem shares have danced with the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white. The stock fell under it, and then back under it, last month, but the 200-day line acted as a ceiling on Tuesday.

â¢ Underscoring the depth of downward momentum now in place is major and rising bearish volume â¦ well above-average.

â¢ If the December low of $246.57 is breached, and then if yesterday's low of $241.16 fails to hold the stock up, that just might prompt the last of the would-be profit-takers out of their position.

### Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)

Tech giant Hewlett Packard Enterprise looked like it was going to recover with most other stocks after suffering the same setback other stocks suffered last month. But that rebound effort from HPE broke ranks on Tuesday. Worse, the shape of yesterday's bar says it was a decisive break-away from the broad rising tide.

One or two more bad days could drag HPE back below a key moving average line, rekindling the downtrend that has been in place since September.

  
Click to Enlarge â¢ Tuesday's bar is an almost-perfect outside day, where yesterday's open was above Monday's close, but Tuesday's close was below Monday's open; clearly the two days were pointed in opposite directions. But, the height and relative positions of the two bars suggests a major swing in sentiment.

â¢ Adding to the bearish thesis is the fact that the two highest-volume days since Christmas were both bearish days. The bulls just aren't coming to the table.

â¢ A cross back under the blue 20-day moving average line may put HPE back into a full-blown downtrend.

### ServiceNow (NOW)

Finally, the past several weeks have been volatile ones for ServiceNow, but meaningless ones as well. NOW shares ended yesterday's action where they were in July.

There's benefit in the indecision though. In that periods of major movement are followed by periods of no movement -- and vice versa -- we're likely to be close to a prolonged period of net movement. What remains to be seen is which direction that move will carry ServiceNow shares.

  
Click to Enlarge â¢ The ceiling to watch is around $193, where NOW has peaked a few times in recent months. It pushed above that line in August, but the $193 mark means more and could indicate a breakout thrust is underway.

â¢ Conversely, a break under the floor around $159 could lead to a bigger selloff from traders who are already/still nervous after Q4's big stumble.

â¢ In the meantime, don't be too quick to react. The trading range here is wide, and ServiceNow shares have been prone to sudden directional shifts due to changing headlines.

As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. You can follow him on Twitter, at @jbrumley.

2019-01-08	2019-01-08 23:23:11	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Union Pacific Investors Like What They See In New COO	Union Pacific's new Chief Operating Officer (COO) is getting plaudits from investors who think the new executive will keep the railroad on track to getting leaner.  The second-largest rail operator by track mileage named Jim Vena as its new COO effective January 14.  Vena, a 40-year executive with Canadian National Railway who started as a brakeman, served as Executive Vice President and COO of Canada's largest railway under Hunter Harrison, its former chief executive.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-investors-see-coo-232311694.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-01-08	2019-01-08 22:55:33	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	UNP News: Why Union Pacific Stock Is Surging Today	"Union Pacific stock (NYSE:UNP) is up more than 8% on Tuesday as the company announced the hiring of a new chief operating officer to its fold.

The railroad company -- which was created in 1969 and is based out of Omaha, Nebraska -- saw its stock increase the most it has since 2009 as it hired 60-year-old Jim Vena to become its new COO. Vena, who is a protege of railroading giant Hunter Harrison, will take over in the role on Jan. 14 with the goal of helping the company become more efficient in its operations.

The new Union Pacific COO will be in charge of the company's goals to shift towards precision scheduled railroading, which Harrison pioneered and brought to Union Pacific late in 2018. Vena's return to the railroading world follows his June 2016 retirement from Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) after a 40-year stint with the company.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Vena has plenty of experience with precision scheduled railroading, working within the discipline for more than two decades. He also has north of a decade working alongside Harrison. The goal of the precision scheduled railroading shift is to help improve profits, which it has already done so at four major railroads, including Canadian National.

&quot;This marks yet another milestone in the PSR [precision scheduled railroading] chronicles at UNP, and puts the company one step closer to full network implementation by mid-2019 -- which is now clearly visible,&quot; Credit Suisse analyst Allison Landry said in a note Monday. &quot;We think execution risk is diminished.&quot;

UNP stock is up about 8.8% on Tuesday following the news.

2019-01-08	2019-01-08 20:40:26	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	5 Top Stocks to Trade Wednesday: Where to Buy Amazon, Tilray	"After a monstrous rally on Friday and a continuation on Monday, the markets are finally taking a pause on Tuesday. That's got investors wondering, are stocks consolidating before another rally or are we in the midst of a dead cat bounce?

We'll try to navigate this tricky landscape as best we can as we eye our top stock trades for Wednesday.

### Russell 2000 ETF (IWM)

  
Click to Enlarge One reason this market is tricky? Because a few weeks ago, market participants were under the belief that the Federal Reserve would continue hiking interest rates at a time where the yield curve was about to invert and the economy would eventually tumble into a recession.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

After printing a monstrous jobs report on Friday and after the Fed came out with a more dovish tone on the same day, investors are rethinking their outlook for the U.S. After a big rally in stocks though, many names are coming into key levels as we're only about a week and a half away from earnings. Then there's President Trump's speech on Tuesday night regarding &quot;the wall.&quot; Like I said, tough sledding.

The Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM) has been one of the leaders when it comes to market direction. Meaning its direction has been the early tell on what the overall market is doing. Lately, it's been strong and that's a good sign for bulls. However, it's coming into a big-time prior support level now.

$145 was a key level through 2018. Some may say that the February and April bounces were a result of the 200-day moving average. I would say that it was likely that both levels played a role.

  * The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index 



In any regard, the IWM has rallied eight of the last nine sessions while rallying about 12.5% in that time. To see $145 and the 50-day moving average act as resistance would come as little surprise at this point. If it does, I would love to see the 21-day moving average act as support.

### Union Pacific (UNP)

  
Click to Enlarge Up over 8.5% on Tuesday, Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is making waves after announcing a new COO.

After the stock's massive gap-up, it leaves traders who weren't in the trade in a tough spot. Do you chase up here or take a pass? I would love to see a $5 pullback into the mid-$140s. UNP has a chance to find support from the 50-day and 200-day moving averages down near this level.

On the upside, it could run into the backside of a few prior uptrend support lines between $150 and $155. Ultimately though, I'm more interested in how UNP handles $157.50.

### Salesforce (CRM)

  
Click to Enlarge Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has been bouncing back with a vengeance and bulls sure are happy to see it. While CRM has been extra volatile, it's hard to ignore a best-in-breed cloud play.

I'm not a big head-and-shoulders guy, but this one has similar makings of a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders setup. Although I would feel better about a healthy pullback down to the $135 to $138 area before recharging higher, the $147 level is proving it will be pivotal. A push through the &quot;neckline&quot; could spark a breakout rally.

Considering the last few months though, I would be more inclined to take profits in CRM and wait for a pullback than bank on a breakout.

### Tilray (TLRY)

  
Click to Enlarge Shares of Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) had been stuck in a big downtrend since September. All of its large rallies were met with sellers at downtrend resistance (black line), while buyers have buoyed the stock near downtrend support (blue line).

Jumping 12.5% on Tuesday, the stock is popping over downtrend resistance for the first time in months. It's also over the 21-day moving average. Bulls can use a stop-loss at ~$75 and target the $95 to $100 range.

### Amazon (AMZN)

  
Click to Enlarge We flagged this one coming into the new year, along with the rest of FAANG. The chart for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is practically identical from that article.

After going from ~$1,300 to $1,650 in just a few trading sessions, I am not a buyer of AMZN stock up 27%. If downtrend resistance doesn't slow AMZN, I expect the 200-day moving average to slow its roll.

So where will it pullback to? That's a tough question because it depends on what the overall market is doing. I would love to see $1,540 to $1,600 hold up as support, but that represents a decline of just 3% to 6%. In a market like this, we can see that in just a day.

But where to buy Amazon isn't my main concern, it's not buying it at this point. Wait for a better setup before chasing Amazon $350 off the low and into resistance.

2019-01-08	2019-01-08 15:30:25	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Strong Intermodal Growth Drove Union Pacificâs Rail Traffic Higher	"US Rail Traffic Saw Impressive Growth in the Last Week of 2018

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Intermodal traffic increased

Rail traffic volumes for Union Pacific (UNP) rose 5.6% YoY to 133,086 units in Week 52 driven mainly by strong growth in intermodal units. In 2018, the company recorded a 3.6% YoY increase in railcar traffic. Its rail traffic gain was 0.1% lower than US railroad (XTN) companiesâ overall 3.7% gain during the same period.

In Week 52, Union Pacificâs intermodal traffic increased 7.3% YoY to 55,338 containers and trailers from 51,576 units in the same period of the previous year. The company carried 52,702 containers in the week compared to 48,787 containers in the same week in 2017. However, the railroad companyâs trailer volumes contracted 5.5% YoY to 2,636 units compared to 2,789 units in Week 52 of 2017.

Union Pacificâs intermodal volume gain was the third highest among all Class I railroad companies. Canadian National (CNI) topped its peers with growth of 9.6% followed by Norfolk Southernâs (NSC) 8.4% growth in Week 52. BNSF Railway was the only Class I railroad company to report a decline in its intermodal traffic, which fell 3.4%.

## Carload traffic

Union Pacific reported a 4.4% YoY increase in its carload traffic in Week 52. The company hauled 77,748 railcars excluding intermodal units compared to 74,494 in the same period last year. Commodity groups excluding coal and coke posted a 5.5% YoY increase in traffic to 57,894 railcars from 54,870 railcars. Coal and coke traffic inched up 1.2% YoY in Week 52 to 19,854 carloads from 19,624 carloads in the same week of 2017.

The commodity groups excluding coal and coke that reported notable volume growth in Week 52 included petroleum products, chemicals, metal products, and metallic ores. The commodity groups other than coal and coke that recorded YoY falls in volumes in Week 52 were nonmetallic minerals, forest products, and motor vehiclesÂ and equipment.

Kansas City Southern (KSU) was the only Class I railroad company that reported a YoY fall in carload traffic in Week 52. The companyâs carload traffic inched down 0.9%.

Next, weâll discuss Kansas City Southernâs rail traffic performance.

## Shares soared

Union Pacific (UNP) shares were trading ~8% higher during pre-market tradingÂ on January 8 after the company named railroad industry veteran Jim Vena as its new executive vice president and COO. Vena will return to the industry after retiring in June 2016.

Apart from handling daily operations, Vena will lead Union Pacificâs ambitious âUnified Plan 2020â announced in October. Under the plan, the company intends to reduce its operating ratio 60% by 2020 and 55% in the long run. For the third quarter, the company reported an operating ratio of 61.7%âflat compared to the same quarter the previous year.

Lance Fritz, Union Pacificâs chairman, president, andÂ CEO, said, âUnified Plan 2020 combines precision scheduled railroading principles with our own UP Way tools and best practices.â

The precision scheduled railroading principles help railroad companiesÂ reduce network complexity and improve operational efficiency. Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and CSX (CSX) have implemented the same principle, which helped them improve their operating ratios.

## Venaâs milestones

Vena is well known in the industry. He was Canadian National Railwayâs (CNI) executive vice president and COO for more than four decades. During his tenure at Canadian National Railway, the companyÂ had the best safety incident ratio in its history and the best operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in the North American rail industry (IYT).

Union Pacific hopes that Vena will help the companyÂ achieve its ambitious long-term targets in the âUnified Plan 2020.â On Venaâs appointment, Fritz said, âWe have been making excellent strides rolling out Unified Plan 2020, and Jimâs vast knowledge of the precision scheduled railroading model brings significant experience and expertise that will enhance the work already underway.â"	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/11edf579-da9c-3ec8-9066-ef25440448b3/union-pacific-shares-rose%3A.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-01-08	2019-01-08 14:00:17	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Strong Carload Growth Drove CSXâs Rail Traffic Higher	"US Rail Traffic Saw Impressive Growth in the Last Week of 2018

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Strong carload traffic growth

CSXâs (CSX) freight rail traffic increased 6.2% YoY (year-over-year) to 96,466 units in Week 52 due to strong growth in its carloads. The company posted 10% YoY carload traffic growth in Week 52. CSX moved 55,545 railcars excluding intermodal units in the week compared to 50,476 railcars in Week 52 of 2017.

Compared to US rail carriersâ overall 8.5% carload gains, CSXâs carload traffic saw much higher gains during the week.

The railroad companyâs commodity group carloads except coal and coke accounted for 79% of its total carload traffic in Week 52. CSXâs coal and coke traffic made up the remaining 21% of its total carloads. The traffic of commodity groups excluding coal and coke grew 16% YoY in Week 52 to 40,921 railcars from 40,344 railcars. However, coal and coke traffic fell 7.5% YoY to 11,895 units from 12,857 units.

The commodity groups excluding coal and coke that reported notable volume growth in Week 52 included farm products, grain, petroleum and petroleum products, iron and steel scrap, metal products, metallic ores, and motor vehicles and parts. The commodity group other than coal and coke that recorded a YoY fall in volumes in Week 52 was nonmetallic minerals.

## Intermodal units

CSXâs intermodal traffic growth was the second lowest among Class I railroad companies in the period. In Week 52, the companyâs intermodal traffic grew 1.4% YoY to 40,921 units from 40,344 units in Week 52 of 2017. CSXâs container traffic inched up 1.1% YoY to 39,113 units in Week 52 from 38,691 units in Week 52 of 2017. CSXâs trailer volumes grew 9.4% YoY to 1,808 units from 1,653 units. In 2018, CSXâs intermodal traffic growth was 2.2% YoY, much lower than US railroad companiesâ 5.5% YoY gain during the same period.

The companyâs YoY intermodal traffic gain was the second lowest among all Class I railroad companies (FTXR) during Week 52. Canadian National (CNI), Norfolk Southern (NSC), and Union Pacific (UNP) came in first, second, and third with intermodal volume gains of 9.6%, 8.4%, and 7.3%, respectively. BNSF Railway was the only Class I railroad company that registered a YoY fall in intermodal units. The largest freight railroad company reported a 3.4% YoY fall in intermodal traffic.

Next, weâll discuss Union Pacificâs rail traffic performance.

## Union Pacificâs stock movement

Union Pacific (UNP) is the largest Class I railroad in the United States by revenues. On January 7, the companyâs shares rose 6.7% in after-market tradingÂ and touched $147.75. Union Pacific stock closedÂ at $138.65 on January 7âmarginally up 0.62% from its closing price of $137.79 on January 4. The euphoria in the stock was driven by the announcement of railroad industry veteran Jim Vena as Union Pacificâs COOâeffective January 14.

Investors should recall that Union Pacific hopped on the Precision Scheduled Railroading model in the fourth quarter. Market RealistÂ thinks thatÂ Union Pacific willÂ be the most watched railroad in 2019.

## Union Pacificâs new model

Vena, who retired in June 2016, wasÂ Canadian National Railwayâs (CNI) executive vice president and COO.Â He has a strong 40-year career at the railroad. Vena is seen as a disciple of famed railroader E. Hunter Harrison. Harrison is responsible for Precision Scheduled Railroading in North America. Vena will be responsible for the operational-related aspects at Union Pacific. He will be spearheading the railroadâs Unified Plan 2020, which was announced in October. Vena will report toÂ Lance FritzâUnion PacificâsÂ chairman, president, and CEO.

Regarding the announcement, Fritz said, âUnified Plan 2020 combines precision scheduled railroading principles with our own UP Way tools and best practices.âÂ He also said, âWe have been making excellent strides rolling out Unified Plan 2020, and Jimâs vast knowledge of the precision scheduled railroading model brings significant experience and expertise that will enhance the work already underway.â

During Venaâs term at Canadian National Railroad, the companyÂ had the North American rail industryâs best operating ratioÂ along with the best safety incident ratio inÂ the companyâs history. The US Class I railroad industry (XTN) has witnessed heavy cost-cutting in recent years. Union Pacific joins the fray along with Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railroad (CP), and CSX (CSX) which have been running their operations on the Precision Scheduled Railroading technique."	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f1c2aa5a-a67b-3028-8fbb-6d252b55556b/union-pacific-rose-6.6%25-in.html?.tsrc=rss

## US rail traffic

Major US railroad companies ended 2018 on a strong note, reporting robust freight traffic growth in the last week of the year. US freight rail traffic grew 5.1% in the week that ended on December 29 (Week 52), according to the latest report by the AAR (Association of American Railroads), which came out on January 3.

The AAR compiles weekly rail data received from 12 major US, Mexican, and Canadian railroad companies. The weekly rail traffic figures are reported under two categories: carload traffic and intermodal units.

During the week, railroad companies hauled 411,676 railcars. Carload traffic grew 8.5% YoY (year-over-year) to 210,333 units from 193,855 units. Intermodal traffic grew 1.8% YoY to 201,343 units from 197,783 units.

Eight out of ten carload commodity groups reported increases in Week 52 compared to Week 52 in 2017. These commodity groups included grain, petroleum and petroleum products, and coal carloads. The commodity groups that fell compared to the same week in 2017 included forest products and miscellaneous carloads.

For the 12 months of 2018, US railroad companies reported cumulative volumes of more than 13.6 million carloadsâup 1.8% from the same period of the previous year. Intermodal units totaled 14.5 million containers and trailers, up 5.5% from the previous year. Combined US traffic for 2018 increased 3.7% YoY to more than 28.1 million carloads and intermodal units compared to the previous year.

## Canadian and Mexican railcar traffic

Canadian railroad companies reported 18% YoY growth in carload traffic to 71,380 units in Week 52. Intermodal traffic rose 9% YoY to 53,354 containers and trailers. For the 12 months of 2018, Canadian railroad companies posted cumulative rail traffic growth of 4% YoY, which amounted to 7.9 million carloads, containers, and trailers.

The downtrend in Mexican railroad companies continued in Week 52. These companies carried 14,834 carloads, down 10.8% YoY, and 12,881 intermodal units, down 8.2% YoY, in Week 52. The cumulative traffic for the year was ~2 million carloads, intermodal containers, and trailers.

## Top gainers and losers

In Week 52, all major Class I railroad companies (IYT) registered YoY growth in their rail traffic. Two Canadian railroad companies, Canadian National Railway (CNI) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), topped the list with YoY rail traffic gains of 13.5% and 12.3%, respectively. Norfolk Southern (NSC), BNSF Railway, CSX (CSX), Union Pacific (UNP), and Kansas City Southern (KSU) followed with YoY gains of 11%, 6.8%, 6.2%, 5.6%, and 0.3%, respectively.

2018-09-19	2018-09-19 12:57:01	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	10 Companies Already Hurt by President Trump&apos;s Tariffs	If steep tariffs on goods imported into the United States are only part of a negotiating tactic from President Donald Trump, he certainly has committed to his bluff. Trump&apos;s tariffs - the first of which went into effect in early July and prompted an immediate, equivalent response from America&apos;s trade partners, including China - have been left in place long enough to start taking a measurable toll on American bottom lines. Most consumers and even most investors have yet to see or feel their impact. Despite the relatively civil trade war thus far, the global economy is robust, driving overall corporate earnings upward. Workers are enjoying their recent pay raises. Time is working against certain businesses, however. The ripple effect stemming from the initial victims&apos; struggle could take weeks if not months to be fully felt on other fronts. And new tariffs are being imposed. It will take weeks and/or months to feel their full impact as well, even as those outfits start to feel the early ripples. Still, more than a few major publicly traded stocks have already taken hits related to Trump&apos;s tariffs (and other countries&apos; retaliatory measures). Here are 10 companies that already have run into trade-war headwinds.

2018-07-02	2018-07-02 13:00:02	UNP	Union Pacific Corporation	Do Major US Railroadsâ Dividends Appeal to Investors in 2018?	In the previous part of this series, we examined the leverage levels of major US railroads after their first-quarter earnings. Now letâs consider their dividend payments. Since itâs a capital-intensive industry, railroads reinvest most of their net earnings back into the business. The retention per share ratio is thus very high. That, in turn, lowers their dividend payout ratios. The transportation and logistics sector is included in the industrials sector. Railroadsâ dividend yields have been historically lower than the other subsectors in the industrial (IYJ) sector.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8c54b1f4-84c1-3b80-8834-e3f465acc369/do-major-us-railroads%E2%80%99.html?.tsrc=rss

It hauled ~96,000 carloads that week compared to 97,500 the previous year. Compared to US railroadsâ (XLI) 2.5% YoY growth, UNP saw a negative carload trafficÂ change in Week 25. Its carload volumes trended in the opposite direction of rival BNSF Railwayâs (BRK.B) carload traffic change.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/4eae00c9-b4f1-3ad2-bf39-597e7f425d81/what-pulled-down-union.html?.tsrc=rss

The level of operating cash flow reflects a railroadâs immediate health. Cash flow is a vital factor that enables a company to pay its current expenses. Major components of these expenses include employee costs and servicing of debts. So a railroadâs cash flow statement is an important financial statement for lenders and investors who want to invest in railroad stocks.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/dfb87666-4ae1-3019-9c87-63bd48b4614f/first-quarter-operating-cash.html?.tsrc=rss

In this part, weâll examine their adjusted EPS in the first quarter. Railroads (XLI) withÂ strong track records of managing costs amid higher volumes are rewarded by the market. Their earnings often grow at a rapid pace. Major non-operating costs such as interest also impact railroadsâ earnings. Lower taxes due to theÂ Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in far superior earnings growth for railroads with US-specific operations in the first quarter.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/dbf24efa-95e5-3844-9e00-86f9f01850cc/this-us-railroad-had-the.html?.tsrc=rss

Earlier in this series, we looked at first-quarter freight volume growth for the major US railroads (XLI). In this part, weâll review their operating margin changes for the same quarter. Railroads report operating ratios, which is an important metric for evaluating railroad performance. Operating ratio is the ratio of total operating expenses to revenue. An operating margin is the flip side of an operating ratio. The higher the operating margin, the better the operating efficiency and, in turn, the net margin.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5dae52f9-b829-3743-ae29-c3b26c241131/which-railroad-topped.html?.tsrc=rss

The association further revealed that coalâs share of their total operating revenues rose from 13.9% in 2016 to 14.8% in 2017, behind only intermodal revenues. Nearly 70% of the coal consumed by US coal-fired power plants is carried by railroads.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0d155312-20a0-3948-810d-90bd5b41fc75/what-coal-did-to-major-us.html?.tsrc=rss
