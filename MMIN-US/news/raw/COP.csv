Value investing is a factor-based investing strategy that involves picking stocks that you believe are trading for less than what they are intrinsically worth, usually by measuring the ratio of the stock's price to one or more fundamental business metrics.  Value investors believe that if a business is cheap compared to its intrinsic value, (as measured by its P/E ratio, in this case) the stock price may rise faster than that of others as the price comes back in line with the worth of the company.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/32fa9528-2fb9-322f-b1c7-282ec2044232/top-stocks-for-october-2021.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-27	2021-05-27 04:10:54	COP	ConocoPhillips	Biden Defends Trump Approval of Conoco Arctic Oil Project	(Bloomberg) -- The Justice Department is defending the Trump administration’s approval of a massive ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc. project in federal court, over the objections of environmentalists who say the government didn’t adequately consider the venture’s effect on polar bears and the climate.In a filing with the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska, the Biden administration said Wednesday that Conoco’s Willow project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was approved only after years of analysis, consultation and public input.“Plaintiffs seek to stop the extraction of resources from the petroleum reserve by cherry-picking the records” of the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Army Corps of Engineers, the administration told the court.President Joe Biden previously directed the Interior Department to review its 2020 approval of the Willow project, which has the potential to produce 150,000 barrels of oil per day. The project could include as many as five drilling sites, hundreds of miles of ice roads, an airstrip and a gravel mine site, among other infrastructure.Conservation and indigenous groups have argued the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management failed to sufficiently analyze the environmental and climate impact of the project. Environmentalists also have argued that planned gravel mining activities imperil a potential denning habitat for polar bears. In February, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an emergency order blocking ConocoPhillips from opening a gravel mine site and building roads.The three Republican members of Alaska’s congressional delegation -- Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan as well as Representative Don Young -- pressed the issue with Biden in the Oval Office on Monday after he signed into law a measure that allows cruise ships to resume visits to the state, according to a person familiar with the matter. Sullivan even handed the president and White House staff a full-color one-page briefing on the project to help make his case.In its filing with the court, the Biden administration argued the federal government followed applicable clean water, animal protection and environmental laws in approving the project. And, the administration noted, the Willow venture is set to take place on “valid leases” within the petroleum reserve, where Congress has specifically mandated oil development.Environmentalists blasted the administration’s move Wednesday.“It’s incredibly disappointing to see the Biden administration defending this environmentally disastrous project,” Kristen Monsell, a lawyer at the Center for Biological Diversity said in a news release. “President Biden promised climate action and our climate can’t afford more huge new oil-drilling projects.”The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Wednesday night.Representatives of ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-defends-trump-approval-conoco-041054405.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-05-04	2021-05-04 13:38:15	COP	ConocoPhillips	Conoco Joins Big Oil’s Newfound Thrift With Plan to Cut Debt	(Bloomberg) -- ConocoPhillips will use a rebound in oil and gas prices to cut debt by about 25% over the next five years, signaling a focus on financial prudence even after completing one of the biggest shale takeovers in recent years.The Houston-based company will cut its borrowings by $5 billion, it said in a statement Tuesday, essentially returning its debt pile to the same level as before its purchase of Concho Resources Inc. earlier this year. The plan comes in addition to Conoco’s $1.5 billion-a-year share buyback, which may be increased by the planned sale of its 10% stake in Cenovus Energy Inc., valued at about $2 billion at current prices.U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. also signaled their intention to use surging cash flow to pay down debt and restore their financial strength last week, following a string of damaging losses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The big question is whether independent shale producers like Conoco will do the same given that they have even more debt to work through, or whether they choose to embark on fresh drilling to take advantage of higher oil and natural gas prices.READ: Exxon, Chevron Preach Prudence Even as Cash Waterfall ReturnsSo far, all signs point to discipline as the U.S. oil industry attempts to rebuild its reputation with investors after a decade of poor returns despite record production from the country’s booming shale fields.Conoco fell 1.2% to $52.13 at 9:37 a.m. in New York. It’s gained 30% this year, roughly matching the increase in the S&P 500 Energy Index.Conoco’s adjusted earnings were 69 cents a share in the first quarter, beating the the 54-cent average of analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Previously, Conoco warned its profit would be hit by $300 million of hedging losses in the period, partly due to positions inherited from takeover of Concho. The company has now closed out all those hedges, it said.(Updates shares in penultimate paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conoco-posts-earnings-beat-sell-112227165.html?.tsrc=rss

The company swung to net income of $1.0 billion, or 75 cents a share, from a loss of $1.7 billion, or $1.60 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, such as unrealized gains on its Cenovus stake, adjusted earnings per share came to 69 cents, above the FactSet consensus of $54 cents. Production excluding Libya increased 16.4% to 1,488 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED), just shy of the FactSet consensus of 1,491 MBOED. The company said it has resumed stock buybacks at an annualized rate of $1.5 billion. ConocoPhillips said it currently owns about 10% of Cenovus stock, which based on Monday's stock closing prices could be valued at roughly $1.6 billion. The company plans to start selling off its Cenovus stake in the second quarter of 2021, and expects to complete the sales by the fourth quarter of 2022. The company plans to use the proceeds to fund share repurchases. Separately, ConocoPhillips said it plans to reduce debt by $5 billion over the next five years. ConocoPhillips stock has run up 31.9% year to date, while the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF has climbed 33.9% and the S&P 500 has gained 11.6%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6705eaa6-0df6-332d-8ee2-ec3b90bcb01e/conocophillips-stock-jumps.html?.tsrc=rss

The company is expecting to book restructuring charges of about $300 million before tax related to the acquisition of Concho Resources Inc., which it is buying in an all-stock deal valued at $9.7 billion that was announced in October. The charge will be treated as a special item in non-GAAP adjusted earnings. The company expects to incur losses of about $300 million from commodity hedging positions.

The two oil companies said the proposals looked to micromanage their operations but the SEC said it was “unable to concur” with this argument, the FT reported.The regulator’s view is that the proposal does not seek to micromanage the company to such a degree that its exclusion be appropriate the SEC wrote to ConocoPhillips. This is the first time that the SEC denied requests by oil and gas companies to exclude votes on Scope 3, unidentified activists told FT.ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum and the SEC didn’t respond to FT’s requests for comment.The SEC has been sending its strongest signals yet that corporations will have to disclose more to shareholders about how climate change affects their businesses.Allison Herren Lee, the regulator’s acting chair, announced earlier in the week that the agency will solicit public comment on potential policy changes. “It’s time to move from the question of “if” to the more difficult question of how we obtain disclosure on climate,” Lee said in a speech before the Center for American Progress, a trade group.The SEC also didn’t agree with Exxon Mobil Corp.’s request to let it block a resolution from BNP Paribas Asset Management that urged the oil giant to report if, and how, its lobbying activities aligned with global efforts to fight global warming -- an early sign that U.S. regulators are less likely to side with companies on environmental, social and governance issues under President Joe Biden.Read More: U.S. Weighs Global Climate Impact Benchmark for Wall Street(Adds context starting in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-signals-tougher-line-oil-221607025.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-03-11	2021-03-11 09:32:12	COP	ConocoPhillips	ConocoPhillips To Buy Back $1.5B In Stock; Shares Gain 3%	Shares of ConocoPhillips closed 2.6% higher on Wednesday after the natural gas company announced the resumption of its stock repurchase program. ConocoPhillips (COP) resumed its share repurchase program at an annualized level of $1.5 billion. This reflects a 50% increase compared to the level of buyback activity in the fourth quarter of 2020. Notably, the buyback program was suspended due to the Concho transaction. ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance said, “It’s still early in the new year, but commodity prices have strengthened such that our dividend alone may not be sufficient to meet our return of capital commitment.” “While today’s action reflects a more constructive outlook on 2021, we do not intend to increase our previously announced operating capital program of $5.5 billion,” Lance added. (See ConocoPhillips stock analysis on TipRanks) Based on the company’s current outlook for 2021 commodity prices, the level of share repurchases announced and the ordinary dividend payments, ConocoPhillips is likely to return greater than 30% of cash from operations to shareholders annually, the company said. On Feb. 3, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta resumed coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $52 (12.5% downside potential) following the company’s “completed acquisition of Concho Resources.” The analyst remains “constructive on the free cash flow power of the combined business and sees a compelling valuation at current levels after ConocoPhillips shares have underperformed peers over the last year.” ConocoPhillips shares have surged 82.5% over the past year, while the stock still scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys and 1 Hold. That’s alongside an average analyst price target of $57, which implies 4% downside potential to current levels. Additionally, ConocoPhillips scores a “Perfect 10” from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

2021-02-26	2021-02-26 00:33:20	COP	ConocoPhillips	Power Prices in U.S. West Topped Price Cap During Texas Freeze	(Bloomberg) -- Electricity prices in the U.S. West briefly topped the soft price cap of $1,000 a megawatt-hour last week after natural gas prices soared during extreme weather, according to a trading group.Several real-time trades through bilateral contracts surpassed that level in parts of Montana, Colorado and New Mexico, Scott Miller, executive director of Western Power Trading Forum, said in an e-mailed statement. The states are members of the Western Electric Coordinating Council and any power sold above the price cap must be reported in a filing to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The power price increases were “driven by really high gas prices related to last week’s event” that crippled the Texas grid and affected surrounding areas, Miller said.It’s unclear how much power traded above $1,000 or the number of instances because it’s a “very opaque, illiquid part of the wholesale power market,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/power-prices-u-west-topped-003320799.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-12	2021-02-12 17:05:17	COP	ConocoPhillips	Oil Set for Weekly Gain With Market Firming on Draining Surplus	(Bloomberg) -- Oil in New York rose to the highest intraday level in more than a year as output curbs from top producers whittle down global inventories.Futures climbed as much as 2.6% on Friday, set for a second straight weekly gain, alongside a firmer U.S. equity market. OPEC+ continues to slash output and the group expects a stronger second half of the year, indicating this week that global inventories will face sharp declines unless the cartel boosts supply. Iraq said OPEC+ is unlikely to change its output policy at a March meeting. In the U.S., crude stockpiles are at the lowest in nearly a year.“This time of year, there’s usually builds,” said Bill O’Grady, executive vice president at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. “The draws we’ve been getting are pretty surprising, setting up a really bullish backdrop.”The Brent market’s structure also strengthened Friday, with its so-called backwardation indicating tightening supplies. The nearest timespread traded as strong as 55 cents a barrel, while swaps tied to the North Sea physical market flipped from a discount to a premium, according to brokerage Eagle Commodities.The Covid-19 pandemic continues to crimp fuel consumption from China to the U.S., with the International Energy Agency cutting its demand forecast for 2021 and describing the market as fragile. However, oil has recovered from the depths of the pandemic. Prompt timespreads have widened in a bullish backwardation structure, helping to unwind bloated stockpiles held in onshore tanks and on ships.Meanwhile, oil demand could rise at the fastest pace since the 1970s over the next three years, according to Bank of America Global Research.“Inflation fears are increasing rapidly and there is a historic amount of capital filtering through global financial markets due to all of the stimulus programs,” Ryan Fitzmaurice, commodities strategist at Rabobank, said in a note. Large inflows into the space “speak to the fact that investors want to own commodities at the moment and are willing to overlook some of the weaker fundamental inputs to focus on the bigger picture at hand.”Concerns still remain over whether crude’s rally is sustainable. WTI futures’ 14-day Relative Strength Index rose to the most overbought since 1999 this week and remains above 70 in a sign that the commodity is due for a pullback.“Based on fundamental analysis, the case for further price gains is hard to make, although we are seeing optimism in financial markets in general,” said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro. “We think that much higher oil prices are not sustainable and that oil producers will then start to increase production.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-extends-drop-below-58-234202757.html?.tsrc=rss

2021-02-03	2021-02-03 13:56:10	COP	ConocoPhillips	ConocoPhillips: Debt Overview	Shares of ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) moved higher by 25.16% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt ConocoPhillips has. ConocoPhillips's Debt According to the ConocoPhillips's most recent financial statement as reported on November 3, 2020, total debt is at $15.39 billion, with $14.90 billion in long-term debt and $482.00 million in current debt. Adjusting for $2.49 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $12.90 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. ConocoPhillips has $63.16 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.24. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

2021-02-01	2021-02-01 15:15:05	COP	ConocoPhillips	ConocoPhillips's Earnings Outlook	"On Tuesday, February 02, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) will report its last quarter's earnings. Here is Benzinga's preview of the company's release. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Wall Street analysts see ConocoPhillips reporting a loss of $0.28 per share on revenue of $5.13 billion. ConocoPhillips earnings in the same period a year ago was $0.76 per share. Quarterly sales came in at $8.14 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on COP If the company were to post earnings in line with the consensus estimate when it reports Tuesday, EPS would be down 136.84%. Sales would be down 36.98% from the year-ago period. Here is how the company's EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate -0.28 -0.58 0.24 0.80 EPS Actual -0.31 -0.92 0.45 0.76 Revenue Estimate 4.87 B 4.00 B 6.30 B 7.67 B Revenue Actual 4.38 B 4.02 B 4.81 B 8.14 B Stock Performance Shares of ConocoPhillips were trading at $40 as of January 29. Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 29.51%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are probably unhappy going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. ConocoPhillips is scheduled to hold the call at 12:00:00 ET and can be accessed here.

A sustained rise in global oil prices has U.S. shale producers pondering something few expected to be considering after last year's tumble: how to allocate rising cash flows among new production, dividends and stock buybacks.  U.S. shale producers will generate about $73.6 billion in cash from operations this year, up nearly a third over last year, according to data firm Rystad Energy, based on oil selling for $50 a barrel.  Shale patch results that begin rolling out Tuesday with ConocoPhillips are expected to remain in the red, but lower spending and oil and gas price gains will deliver what is expected to be the start of stronger cash flows.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-shale-ponders-unexpected-coming-153442846.html?.tsrc=rss

Shares of the oil producer fell 5.7% on Friday as crude oil prices slipped. Back in Oct. 2020, ConocoPhillips had agreed to buy rival Concho in an all-stock deal worth $9.7 billion. Per the merger agreement terms, Concho shareholders will receive 1.46 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock for each share held. ConocoPhillips’ (COP) CEO Ryan Lance said, “This acquisition results in the combination of two premier companies that can lead the structural change for our vital industry that’s critical to investors.” He added, “We expect the company to deliver differential performance on three key mandates: providing affordable energy to the world, generating superior returns on and of capital and demonstrating ESG [Environmental, social, and governance] leadership.” In October, ConocoPhillips said that it expects to generate annual cost and capital savings of about $500 million by 2022. (See COP stock analysis on TipRanks). On Jan. 14, Barclays analyst Jeanine Wai raised the stock’s price target to $59 (30.8% upside potential) from $55 and maintained a Buy rating. The analyst remains positive on the US integrated oil and exploration and production industry, citing constructive view of oil prices, healthy forecasted free cash flow, and solid capital discipline. Like Wai, the rest of the Street has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus boasts 14 unanimous Buys. The average analyst price target of $51.62 implies upside potential of about 14.4% to current levels. Shares have declined by about 28% over the past year. Furthermore, TipRanks data shows that financial bloggers have a bullish call on the stock.

2020-12-09	2020-12-09 15:00:13	COP	ConocoPhillips	Biden Can Slow Trump’s Roll on Arctic Oil Drilling	"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Mukluk well, drilled in the unforgiving waters north of Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay, is the stuff of awful legend in oil circles. When it came up dry in 1983 after $2 billion had been sunk, some surmised oil had definitely been there at one point but perhaps shifted elsewhere in a sort of vast geological leg-pull. As one executive involved remarked: “We drilled in the right place. We were simply 30 million years too late.”(1)Fortitude helps, it seems, but timing clearly is everything when it comes to Alaskan wildcatting. The current controversy over new leases to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, won’t play out over eons. However, that’s exactly the sort of timeline the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden — which opposes the auction — will work toward.A drilling lease is an option. An oil producer pays a premium up front, and then the value they realize (or don’t) is a function of several things: Is oil or gas actually there? How much? What does it cost to find and produce?The other thing it is a function of is time. The longer it takes to develop an oilfield, the more that old bugbear, the time value of money, eats into your return on investment. One of the reasons oil companies like shale is that barrels can start flowing in a matter of months, as opposed to conventional resources in remote areas that can take years or even decades to develop. This has become especially important of late amid the industry’s dismal return on capital. A big reason for this was billions of dollars being tied up in big, complex projects, which ran over budget and got delayed, trashing their economics.So while the outgoing administration of President Donald Trump is rushing to get the first ANWR leases auctioned off in early January, Biden’s greatest weapon in trying to prevent any actual drilling will be delay. With Democrats unlikely to have the requisite numbers in the Senate, even after Georgia’s runoffs, the auction results can’t be overturned easily. But they can be messed with in the myriad ways government can mess with things, especially on federal lands. These include having the Bureau of Land Management step down from contesting the lawsuits filed already by indigenous and environmental groups; the BLM itself suing to reopen the review process; or an executive order mandating nothing happen ahead of an extensive review of climate-related risks, according to Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington-based research firm. “Slow works as well as no,” when it comes to a project’s economic viability, he says.All of that might be successfully challenged in courts (with lots of Trump-appointed judges). That said, by rushing the auction, Trump may make those leases more susceptible to challenges on technical grounds. In any case, courts are time machines, as in machines for chewing up time. Whereas environmentalists bemoan the “predatory delay” of oil interests putting off action against climate change in order to realize profits, Biden could engage in what might be called preparatory delay as a tactic to defer them to the point of expiration.And ANWR oil is already on a long fuse, mainly because of the sheer difficulty of drilling in the Arctic. In an analysis published in 2018, the Energy Information Administration surmised that first oil from any new wells in the ANWR’s coastal plain wouldn’t arrive until 2031 — and that was under the explicit assumption of “no protracted legal battle.” Peak production wouldn’t be reached until 2040. Moreover, while the EIA’s mean estimate of technically recoverable oil from the area topped 10 billion barrels — a huge prospect — that was under an assumption back then of Brent crude oil averaging $86 a barrel in real terms this decade and $100 in the next.Optimists may still like those odds or something approaching them. While predictions of peak oil demand have grown more widespread (and imminent in their nature), there are still many who see the seeds of at least one more oil-price spike being sown in the industry’s current spending cutbacks. For their bet to potentially work, peak oil demand forecasts don’t have to be completely wrong, just too early.Still, the list of potential bidders is likely to be a short one. Major banks have already signaled their reluctance to lend to such endeavors, prompting proposed rules forcing them to do so from Republicans (the party of free enterprise, remember them?(2)). Oil majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., which have been busily slashing capex budgets, would struggle to justify taking a punt anyway, not least because of the extra PR damage entailed. BP Plc just pulled out of the North Slope. ConocoPhillips, while it may be Alaska’s biggest oil producer, is scaling back its exploration activity in general and has led the charge on prioritizing payouts to investors over production growth.Privately held operators with less exposure to the spotlight might yet decide the option is worth it — especially if bids are low precisely because the usual crowd shies away. Indeed, January’s auction doesn’t look set to be a gusher; the pressures of low oil prices today and the here-be-dragons level of uncertainty ahead demand low bids.Even after any lease is obtained, buyers must still be comfortable enough to then spend the vastly bigger sums required to actually explore and develop. That’s why delaying progress after leases are sold, or simply threatening to do so, can be such a potent tool for opponents.It isn’t just that a dollar of revenue is worth less the further it is deferred. The original development of the North Slope was delayed for five years by environmental objections. But these were ultimately swept aside by the exigencies of the 1970s oil crises. Today, the context is entirely different.The longer development is delayed in ANWR, the closer we get to the 2030s and ’40s — and the clearer the impact of things like electric vehicles on oil demand will become. In that sort of oil market, relatively expensive barrels from Alaska would struggle to compete, especially if their biggest nearby outlet, California, was more electrified than elsewhere. At this point, a tectonic shift in oil can happen in years rather than millennia.(1) Richard Bray, president of BP-affiliate Sohio's production company, quoted in Dan Yergin's ""The Prize"".(2) Me neither.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2020-12-02	2020-12-02 18:11:14	COP	ConocoPhillips	Energy Stock Short Sellers Took A $6.3B Loss In November As Oil Prices Rebounded	"The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLE) has more than tripled the return of the S&P 500 over the past month as investors are piling into energy stocks in anticipation of an oil market rebound in 2021 and beyond.With WTI crude oil prices now back above $44 for the first time since before the pandemic, S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky said energy stock short sellers took quite a beating in the past month. Energy stock short sellers endured $6.35 billion in net mark-to-market losses in November.Energy sector short interest now totals $27.8 billion, and short sellers covered just $394 million of their aggregate positions during the month despite heavy losses. Dusaniwsky said the short selling data does not support the theory that energy stock gains in the past month have been driven by significant short covering.Related Link: UBS Downgrades Occidental Petroleum, Recommends 3 Other Oil StocksMost Shorted Energy Stocks: Here are the five energy stocks with the largest outstanding short positions, according to S3:  * Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM), $1.86 billion in short interest.  * ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), $1.35 billion in short interest.  * Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), $1.16 billion in short interest.  * Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE: MPC), $1.14 billion in short interest.  * Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL), $754 million in short interest.Short sellers have been particularly aggressive in betting against ConocoPhillips in the last month. ConocoPhillips' short interest increased by $330.3 million in November.Dusaniwsky said energy stock short sellers had some home run trades in November led by Gulfport Energy Corporation (OTC: GPOR), which netted short sellers a $6.8 million profit on the month. However, short sellers took November losses of $265.7 million on Chevron, $280,3 million on Exxon, $289.3 million on Marathon Petroleum and $346.6 million on ConocoPhillips.""If the Energy sector continues to rally, we should see more short covering as shorts begin to realize their year-to-date profits and rotate into other more attractive sectors,"" Dusaniwsky said.Benzinga's Take: Oil stock short sellers made a killing during the early stages of the pandemic when oil prices briefly crashed below $0 at one point. However, BP plc (NYSE: BP) recently projected that global oil demand will not peak until at least 2030, so the companies that have survived the multiyear downturn could now be well-positioned for a long-term upswing in the next oil cycle.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Why BofA Securities Is Overweight Energy Stocks In 2021(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-12-01	2020-12-01 19:16:30	COP	ConocoPhillips	Conoco Warns of 500 Houston Job Cuts as Concho Deal Nears	(Bloomberg) -- ConocoPhillips may dismiss as much as one-fourth of its Houston headquarters staff as the largest independent oil explorer cuts costs and prepares for the takeover of Concho Resources Inc.Affected employees will be notified as early as Feb. 1 and will receive 60-days advance notice, severance pay and help finding new jobs, Conoco said in an email on Tuesday. The company agreed to buy Concho in October and the $11.4 billion deal is expected to close next year.“The process to determine the exact number of impacted employees is ongoing,” the company said. “However, we anticipate the number of reductions in Houston could meet the threshold of 500 or more.”Conoco emerged as one of the stronger independent oil producers from this year’s pandemic-driven price crash with almost $7 billion of cash on hand at the end of the third quarter. But the company is not immune from the slump and has reduced production 22% over the past year, meaning fewer employees are needed.“We have been transparent with employees that targeted workforce reductions in certain areas of our business may be necessary from time to time to align organizational capacity with expected future activity levels,” Conoco said.The acquisition of Concho will make Conoco a major player in the Permian Basin, the world’s biggest shale field, and gives the company the option of growing production in the future. But so far CEO Ryan Lance has given no indication of a major ramp up. Last month he pledged to only reinvest 70% of the company’s cash flow in capital spending, indicating a conservative approach to new drilling.(Updates with company comment in 5th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conoco-warns-500-houston-job-191630145.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-12-01	2020-12-01 10:00:04	COP	ConocoPhillips	Even Exxon Mobil Is Capitulating to Peak Oil Demand	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Et tu, Exxon?Through all the shifts that have swept through the oil market in recent years, one thing has been a reliable constant: Exxon Mobil Corp. has remained resolute in its bullishness about the future of crude. In stark contrast to European competitors who've speculated about a peak in oil demand and switched investments toward renewables, Chairman Darren Woods has kept on preaching that old-time religion.The pullback by rivals shouldn’t be seen as a harbinger of doom for crude, but as an opportunity to spend more aggressively, Woods said at an investor day in March: “The best time to invest in these businesses is during a low, which will lead to greater value capture in the coming upswing.” Internal documents reviewed by Bloomberg Green earlier this year showed the company planned to increase its annual emissions 17% by 2025. Now even this most reliable of oil bulls seems to be having doubts. Exxon Mobil’s natural gas fields will be written down by as much as $20 billion, the company said Monday. More tellingly, those counter-cyclical spending plans are being marked to market. Annual capital investment through 2025 will be in the range of $20 billion to $25 billion, some $10 billion below the level that Woods forecast in March.That still sounds like a pretty substantial number — but when considered in the context of the wells Exxon Mobil is already operating, it looks markedly smaller. Depreciation, depletion and amortization is already running in the region of $20 billion every year. Subtract that amount, and you’re left with a growth capex figure of $5 billion a year at best, or zero at worst.Exxon Mobil likes to point to forecasts that the world will need new oil supplies to increase by 8% a year in the near term to meet rising demand as existing fields decline, with new gas requirements rising 6% a year, too. Its newly modest spending plans aren’t going to be sufficient to meet that scenario, let alone increase its own market share.In capitulating to a more subdued outlook, Exxon Mobil is simply following where other companies have led. It’s the only one of the big seven independent oil majors where analysts’ expectations of depreciation don’t already outstrip capital spending over the three years through 2022.Even if you look at the three years through 2023 to exclude the extreme circumstances of the current pandemic-hit year, BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and ConocoPhillips aren’t expected to spend enough to keep up with depreciation. Across the seven large independent oil companies, the deficit will amount to $4.82 billion. Investments in renewables by the likes of Equinor ASA and Shell are still too small to take a substantial chunk out of the industry’s petroleum-focused capex, but they certainly don’t help. Oil giants are divesting from petroleum as fast as any climate-focused fund manager.The same logic applies when you extend things further, to the listed national oil companies. Thanks to a $19 billion cut in capital spending by China’s big three oil majors this year and rising charges resulting from their spending splurge in previous periods, PetroChina Co. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, will be markedly more restrained in their investments in the years ahead. Growth capex totals of $3.18 billion and negative $4.76 billion respectively will be invested in the three years through 2022, based on analyst estimates.Petroleo Brasileiro SA, still recovering from a splurge in the early part of this decade, will reduce its net investments by $6.8 billion over the period. Equinor, aiming at a target of net zero emissions by 2050, will see depreciation exceed capex by about $656 million.Put together, the result looks like an oil industry that stopped spending four years ago and is showing no appetite to start again. Aggregate growth capex across a group of seven large independent and six national oil companies with adequate data will be a negative $23.8 billion this year and minus $6.77 billion next year. Even in 2022, when the sector as a whole should return to a measure of growth, the total will be about $8.8 billion — less than half the amount spent by Exxon Mobil alone in 2014.Oil gets used up quickly, so if the industry doesn’t spend, production will slump in short order. If investment continues at 2020 levels, supply will be 9 million barrels lower than forecast as soon as 2025, according to the International Energy Agency — equivalent to roughly 10% of the current oil market.It’s still probably too early to read oil majors’ miserliness as an indication that they expect demand to fall at quite that pace. The risks of under-investment are relatively limited, as long as everyone moves at the same time. If the world ends up seriously short of crude five years from now, they’ll end up raking in profits that can be recycled on belatedly plugging the deficit.Still, borrowing costs for investment-grade energy companies right now are the lowest they’ve been in six years. If oil majors were half as confident about the future of their core product as they claim to be, they’d be preparing to spend with abandon. When even Exxon Mobil closes its check book, the industry’s future looks truly doubtful.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

Earlier this year, prices for barrels of crude dipped into negative territory – it made more sense to pay not to take delivery, which of course made no sense at all. Therefore, it’s no surprise that Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) suffered badly during this year. But bad times don’t always last forever – will this fact help XOM stock?

Certainly, I can appreciate that it’s tempting to dive into big oil right now. Yes, political pressure, especially with the transition in power, is a darkening cloud hanging over XOM stock, as well as rivals like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).
However, the Democrats will not be able to overturn the fossil fuel industry overnight. And in the race to go green, we will need “interim” energy sources to help us complete the ultimate transition.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Essentially, this means XOM stock has a long pathway of business viability. But in the nearer term, Americans are tired of being cooped up at home. Further, various state and local government officials are stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Optically and morally, they can’t let their constituents die amid a still mysterious health threat. Simultaneously, forcing lockdown measures will almost surely cripple small businesses, the backbone of America’s economy.
To that effect, I’m sure I’m not the only one who has witnessed a rise in automotive traffic. In addition, the airliner industry is enjoying some encouraging data. According to the Transportation Security Administration, over one million passengers went through airport checkpoints on Nov. 22, which is approximately 45% of the year-ago level.
To be sure, we still have a long way to go. Finally, though, the consumer travel industry appears to be on a recovery trek, which bodes well for XOM stock. Nevertheless, this may be a sell into strength opportunity rather than a true mending signal.

If we perform this exercise, it appears more likely that XOM stock is benefiting from a return to normalcy in the political realm rather than a factor related to underlying business strength.
To demonstrate this, I broke down historical spot oil prices for the West Texas Intermediate index in five-year intervals. Roughly speaking, the oil market experiences generational phases (about 15 to 20 years) that transition from growth to consolidation back to growth. If you believe in the cyclical nature of the stock market and the commodities sector, this analysis should be familiar to you. To summarize:
The period between the 1970s to the mid-1980s was characterized by quick and robust growth in the oil market.
From the mid-80s throughout the 1990s, oil experienced a long consolidation phase.
Then, from the 2000s to the oil price deflation event around the middle of last decade, oil again saw tremendous growth.
If we follow the logic of this pattern, we should expect the next generation to be one of consolidation. Interestingly, oil prices were already correcting from their highs before the novel coronavirus pandemic. It’s just that the crisis accelerated the negativity, perhaps a little quicker than it “deserved.”
In this context, we shouldn’t be shocked that XOM stock is jumping higher in recent sessions. Again, the push for clean energy is strong but it won’t spark an overnight paradigm shift. For instance, we still have overwhelmingly more combustion-engine cars on the road than we do electric vehicles.
However, my hesitation toward XOM stock is that shares are fighting against broader market trends. Sure, we have promising vaccines on the cusp of approval. But because of the seismic transition that society has made to combat Covid-19, it’s entirely possible that less travel will occur during typical rush hour zones, even post-pandemic.
That would apply significant pressure on the oil industry, which would make Exxon Mobil a good investment for now – not a good investment period.
Signs of Consumer Confidence Fracturing
Another reason that keeps me away from the oil sector is that some of the positive movements could be relying on lagging data. However, the most recent data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics indicates that rising coronavirus cases are having a negative impact on consumer sentiment.
Primarily, the number of people who are staying home increased nearly 9% between the week beginning Oct. 25 and Nov. 1. Also, during the same period, the number of trips taken between 25 to 100 miles declined 1.1%. This suggests that people are concerned about soaring Covid-19 cases. Therefore, it’s possible that transportation stats can decline further in the weeks ahead.
Unfortunately, that puts XOM stock in an awkward position despite nearer-term bullishness. If you won on the speculation, congratulations! However, you may want to consider an exit plan.

Across U.S. shale, the average price has plummeted to about $5,000 an acre, compared with $17,000 two years ago.The plunge in acreage prices is a sign of the crisis facing U.S. oil and gas explorers, who are grappling with a pandemic-driven slide in crude demand after more than a decade of debt-fueled production growth. Large, financially stable producers are gobbling up smaller peers amid a wave of takeovers, the biggest of which was ConocoPhillips’s proposed purchase of Concho Resources Inc. for $9.7 billion.Source: Bloomberg Intelligence“Low equity prices and the need for investor support is motivating many operators to look for new options to merge,” Rystad senior analyst Alisa Lukash wrote in a report Thursday.READ: Biggest U.S. Gas Producer Seeks More M&A After Chevron DealIndustry-wide costs for drilling and completing wells will probably drop as much as 5% next year because of consolidation, increased standardization and a drop in service costs, Rystad said. Even more capital will be allocated to the most prolific Permian acreage, the firm said.Permian-focused Concho’s drilling rights were valued at about $10,471 per acre in the proposed ConocoPhillips takeover announced last month, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That compares with $75,504 an acre for Concho’s purchase of RSP Permian Inc. in 2018.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/renting-slice-u-oil-hot-192244134.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-11-04	2020-11-04 22:18:55	COP	ConocoPhillips	Investors Sour on Green Wave as Democrats’ Hope for Senate Fades	(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s confidence that the U.S. election would spark a clean-energy revolution dimmed after Republicans appeared set to retain control of the Senate, casting doubts over whether Joe Biden could pursue his climate agenda even if he wins the White House.As a picture slowly emerged Wednesday of Democrats positioned to potentially take the White House but not Congress, renewables stocks including JinkoSolar Holding Co. and First Solar Inc. slumped. Oil and gas companies rallied, led by Concho Resources Inc. and ConocoPhillips.Biden, who led President Donald Trump in electoral votes Wednesday afternoon, has proposed sweeping plans to move away from fossil fuels, promote electric vehicles and eliminate greenhouse gases from the electricity grid by 2035. But with Republicans poised to hold onto their slim majority in the Senate, those ambitions may run aground amid gridlock.“There was some anticipation of a Democratic sweep and the possibility of major climate reform,” Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said in an interview. But without allies in the Senate “he’ll have to rely on executive action, tinkering around the edges, rather than anything game-changing or transformative.”Concho rose 4.1%, and ConocoPhillips climbed 3.7%.Marathon Oil Corp. rose 3.1%JinkoSolar plunged 12%, and First Solar fell 8.6%. Morgan Stanley cut its rating on First Solar to the equivalent of sell.Clean energy giant NextEra Energy Inc., the world’s biggest producer of wind and solar electricity, slipped 3.6%.In Europe, Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the world’s top wind-turbine producer, slumped the most in three years before paring the losses.“Perhaps the biggest conclusion to be drawn at this stage is that there is only a small likelihood that existing oil & gas tax incentives will be removed in the U.S. -- even if Biden emerges as the winner,” Artem Abramov, head of shale research at Rystad Energy, said in a note to clients. Still, Biden would be able to ban new fracking on federal lands via an executive order, which would hit producers in New Mexico and elsewhere.​With votes still being counted in key battleground states including Pennsylvania and Nevada, it’s unclear if the U.S. will more aggressively shift toward clean energy, as Biden has pledged -- or if Trump will get four more years to promote fossil fuels.“Even in the event that Biden wins the election, we think the prospects of the solar industry look much less favorable given a lower probability of an extension of the investment tax credit,” said Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA, in a research note. CFRA downgraded SunPower Corp. and manufacturer Canadian Solar Inc. to hold from buy.While investors may be spooked by the uncertainty, it’s unlikely a second Trump term would significantly thwart the growth of wind and solar power. Demand for clean power has increased throughout the Republican’s presidency, thanks to state-level policies, corporations pushing to go green and a growing appetite for environmental, social and governance, or ESG, investments.A Biden victory, conversely, could be give natural gas a boost as “a cleaner transition fuel” in the shift to a lower-carbon economy, RBC analyst Scott Hanold said in a note.(A previous version of this story corrected the size of index decline in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/renewable-energy-shares-fall-u-142819856.html?.tsrc=rss

"Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is slightly lower on Friday after the company announced a mixed third-quarter report. XOM stock is off this week’s low, but hovers precariously close to the 2020 low from March.

Currently near $32.50, the stock is not all that far from its $28.97 low. 
Some traders and investors may argue that shares are more than 10% above those lows. That observation is true. However, in a world where the energy market remains under pressure and where XOM stock is still down 52% from its 2020 high, a few bucks a share suddenly doesn’t seem like very much. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The Quarter
The company reported a loss of 18 cents per share, beating expectations by 18 cents. The result is actually pretty impressive. Not just because Exxon beat estimates, but because it’s curbing its losses. 
That’s despite the company generating revenue of “just” $46.2 billion. That missed estimates by more than $2 billion and marked a decline of almost 30% year over year. 
That said, Exxon still lost $680 million in the quarter. That was better than the $1.08 billion it lost in the prior quarter. While the trend is improving, there’s still reason for investors to be hesitant. 


					7 Trends To Watch for the Future of Aerospace Stocks				

Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said, “We remain confident in our long-term strategy and the fundamentals of our business, and are taking the necessary actions to preserve value while protecting the balance sheet and dividend.” 
Protecting the balance sheet and the dividend is important for investors at this point, as we need to avoid a liquidity situation. 
Breaking Down Exxon Mobil
Big oil is a tough place right now. The energy space remains under a lot of pressure thanks to the global pandemic. That goes for Exxon, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and others. 
I struggle with the energy space. On the one hand, there is obvious value in the group on a long-term horizon. At the same time, I value the technicals alongside the fundamentals. Neither of them seemingly have any momentum. 
So for active traders and even low-active investors, energy may not be a place to commit investment funds just yet. Perhaps energy is only looking attractive for the long-term, deep-value crowd. Some in the industry agree. It’s why ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) scooped up Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) in a $9.7 billion deal.

However, if I’m laying down cash on these companies, I’m buying those with the stronger balance sheets. Thankfully for XOM stock, it has solid financials. 
Surprisingly, the company has been maintaining its dividend as well. Earlier in the week, Exxon declared its quarterly dividend of 87 cents per share. That gives the stock a yield north of 11%. At this point though, I’m not sure if cutting that dividend would give investors relief or disappoint them now that the payout is lower. 
Before the novel coronavirus hit, the energy market was a difficult one to size up. That’s because it has been flush with supply, able to tap into drilled wells at a moments notice and bring supply to the market any time oil prices rose notably. 
With the supply side flush but stable due to coordinated production efforts, oil prices were stable. However, when demand fell through the floor, oil prices tanked. As coronavirus cases climb and as countries go back into lockdown — like France and Germany — one has to wonder about oil demand. 
That’s going to be a negative for Exxon and its peers moving forward. 
Trading XOM Stock
Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com
On the plus side, consensus estimates call for a 500% rebound in earnings next year to profitability. Further, analysts expect revenue to grow almost 20%. Granted that still leaves 2021’s results below 2019’s results — meaning 2020’s decline fully wasn’t erased — but it’s not a story where Exxon continues to break down. At least not yet. 
XOM stock has been stuck below the 20-day moving average for months now. That’s not a good short-term sign. However, the 50-day moving average has been the real resistance level. 
If shares can reclaim the 50-day moving average and rotate over the October high of $35.95, then bulls could see some momentum. That could put $40-plus and/or the 200-day moving average on the table. 
For now, I want to see if shares can hold up over $32.50. Below puts this week’s low in play at $31.11. Below that and XOM stock can test into that $30 level of interest.

2020-10-20	2020-10-20 21:25:45	COP	ConocoPhillips	Oil Climbs While U.S. Lawmakers Discuss a Potential Aid Package	(Bloomberg) -- Oil advanced in New York as U.S. lawmakers negotiated the size of a potential spending bill to boost economic recovery, presenting a rare bright spot for the demand outlook.U.S. crude futures rose above $41 a barrel amid optimism that lawmakers may break a months-long impasse in stimulus talks. Still, any deal may face stiff opposition in the Senate. Futures pared gains in after-hours trading after the American Petroleum Institute was said to report an increase in U.S. crude stockpiles for last week.“Anything that helps the economy do better is going to be helpful for crude,” said Bill O’Grady, executive vice president at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. “Still, driving activity is down and people are not as global as they were. It may get better, but not back to where it was before.”The market is also weighing uncertainty over whether OPEC and its allies will move forward with plans to add 2 million barrels a day back onto the market from January. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that the nation won’t make any decisions about the future of cuts related to the OPEC+ output deal until the group’s meeting next month.U.S. crude futures have struggled to make a sustained break above $40 as governments try to control new flareups of the virus. The worsening virus in Europe is sapping momentum from an already fragile demand recovery. Still, the prospect of a long-awaited stimulus deal in Washington would provide a much-needed boost to demand in the U.S.“According to the current OPEC+ deal, we are going to see 2 million barrels a day come in January, and we’re not so sure the market can handle this,” said Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities. “We’re also going to need more clarity where the fiscal plan is going. So there are a lot of uncertainties out here.”Both Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman and Russia’s Novak offered bearish views on demand at an OPEC+ Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting on Monday. Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman called on the group to be proactive in the face of uncertain demand. The panel did not discuss if OPEC+ should press on with plans to taper output cuts next year, delegates said.Yet, UBS Group AG analysts said delegates at the next JMMC meeting on Nov. 17 will likely recommend that an output delay is announced at the full meeting two weeks later.The industry-funded API reported U.S. crude stockpiles increased 584,000 barrels last week, according to people familiar with the matter. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before a government report on Wednesday forecast inventories fell 1.38 million barrels in the period.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-declines-stimulus-doubts-more-222619226.html?.tsrc=rss

Among those in play, Pioneer Natural Resources Co, one of the largest independent shale operators, is considering a low-premium buyout of Parsley Energy Inc, which could be announced as early as Tuesday, according to sources.

2020-10-20	2020-10-20 09:30:07	COP	ConocoPhillips	Reports of Shale’s Death Were Greatly Exaggerated	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Remember seven months ago, when a three-way supply war between Saudi Arabia, Russia and the U.S. was about to deal a mortal blow to America’s shale oil industry? Whatever happened with that?All the evidence of late is that there’s life in the oil patch yet. Production from Texas’s Permian Basin in September was 4.49 million barrels a day. That’s down from a peak of 4.9 million in March, to be sure, but higher than in any month prior to September 2019 — and the cut is considerably smaller than those enacted by Saudi Arabia and Russia since they struck an agreement to bring the oil market back from the dead in April.Capital markets are taking notice. ConocoPhillips announced Monday that it would buy Concho Resources Inc. for about $9.7 billion in stock, helping consolidate the two companies’ acreage in the Permian. Just three weeks ago, Devon Energy Corp. spent $2.56 billion in shares buying WPX Energy Inc., building its position in one of the lower-cost districts of the Permian. Parsley Energy Inc., one of the remaining minnows in the basin, is in talks about a takeover by Pioneer Natural Resources Co., the Wall Street Journal reported late Monday.As we’ve argued, life is much more manageable in the range of $40 a barrel than many would have expected a few months ago.For exploration and production companies, the size of your balance sheet is probably as important as the size of your reserve base at the moment.Thanks to the slump in interest rates this year, investment-grade energy companies can borrow as cheaply as at any point since before the last oil price crash in 2015, based on the pricing of option-adjusted spreads. Meanwhile, junk-rated energy debt has settled at far higher rates, increasing the advantage for the big end of town. In both the ConocoPhillips-Concho and Pioneer-Parsley deals, we’re seeing companies with relatively comfortable investment-grade ratings buying smaller rivals on the verge of relegation to junk.Once borrowing costs are brought under control, it’s not nearly such a challenge to keep pumping out barrels. The so-called fracklog — drilled but uncompleted wells that could be put into action the moment prices rise far enough to cover their operating costs — remains at elevated levels, with July seeing a record number in the Permian basin. Working through that overhang will be enough to sustain output for some time, even in the absence of aggressive drilling activity. Around 80% of the fracklog is able to break even at prices below $25 a barrel, consultants Rystad Energy estimated in March.That won’t be enough to keep the oil flowing forever, and earlier-stage activity to develop new wells is still relatively subdued. The number of land-based exploration rigs in operation across the U.S. has risen in six of the past nine weeks, but it’s still running at about a third of the levels seen before March’s price crash. Drillers need prices above $50 a barrel before exploration activity picks up substantially, based on the predominant views expressed in a survey of the industry by the Federal Reserve of Dallas last month.Still, that should be cold comfort to oil producers elsewhere in the world. Most members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries need prices north of $60 a barrel to balance their budgets. If $50 is sufficient to kick off a new flood of supply from U.S. shale basins, OPEC members are going to need to force through spending cuts even more radical than the ones they’re already planning. Meanwhile, the consolidation of the U.S. upstream industry from the current wave of deal-making may further reduce its cost structure into the $40s, or even below that.The Hail Mary pass made by the world’s oil exporters in March was that a flood of output would be sufficient to squash the U.S. oil patch for good. That would give OPEC members a chance to build their market share, helping them prop up prices through the inevitable decline of oil demand as the world decarbonizes. It’s not working out that way. Instead, an informal price cap imposed by U.S. shale appears to have grown tighter, from around $60 a barrel between 2015 and 2019 to $50 or less now. Contrary to false statements by President Donald Trump, a Joe Biden presidency won’t ban fracking, either — indeed, as my colleagues Liam Denning and Julian Lee have argued, a more even-handed government may ultimately help the oil industry by pointing a clear path through the transition away from fossil fuels.That may not be a bad thing for the global climate, either. From the perspective of a planet eking out the last of its carbon budget, an industry skewed toward shale wells that exhaust themselves in a few years may well be preferable to one where large companies are still signing off on major conventional fields that can keep producing for decades. This year’s glimpse into the abyss of an oil glut didn’t kill the shale industry. Instead, it may have only made it stronger.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2020-10-19	2020-10-19 19:57:27	COP	ConocoPhillips	Oil Edges Lower as OPEC+ Keeps Its Next Moves Close to Chest	(Bloomberg) -- Oil in New York fell slightly under $41 a barrel after the OPEC+ Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee made no mention of any changes to a plan to further ease oil-output cuts from January.Still, Saudi Oil Minister Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman called on the OPEC+ alliance to be proactive in the face of uncertain demand, providing some reassurance for the market. Traders also are looking for signs that lawmakers in Washington can agree on a stimulus deal ahead of the election while a resurgence in the pandemic threatens any recovery.“OPEC is already seeing prices down near $40 a barrel and that’s a little lower for them, so they will likely err on the side of caution and keep at least some of those barrels off the market,” said Gary Cunningham, a director at Tradition Energy. Still, “any barrels at all is detrimental to the equation at this point.”Oil ministers met against a backdrop of uneven oil demand. For months now, the recovery in consumption has been driven largely by China, whose economic expansion showed signs of broadening in September. Yet, other countries are still clawing their way out of the slump, with fresh outbreaks of Covid-19 in Europe and the U.S. weighing on energy use.“If the world was more or less on one trajectory, oil markets, investors and OPEC itself could at least take cues from that,” said Ryan Giannotto, director of research at GraniteShares. “But when you have a shattered market where every area of the economy is performing differently, that really complicates the picture.”In the meantime, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were slated to discuss a stimulus deal Monday afternoon. However, the S&P 500 Index slipped as opposition to a sizable aid package hardened in the Republican-controlled Senate.If market uncertainty persists through next month, OPEC+ will probably decide to bring back less supply than the planned 1.9 million barrels a day in January, Citigroup Inc. analyst Ed Morse wrote in a report. Meanwhile, Morningstar’s Sandy Fielden said that the global and U.S. crude benchmarks may slip back to the $30 a barrel range if the economic recovery remains slow and producers don’t cut output.Still, a pickup in U.S. airline traffic is providing some hope for distillate stockpiles, which despite consecutive drawdowns remain at their highest seasonal level since 2010. Over the weekend, U.S. air passengers exceeded 1 million for the first time since March, though the industry is still reeling from the pandemic-driven travel slump.Crude’s structure points toward underlying firmness in the market, with the spread between WTI’s nearest contracts rallying to its narrowest contango structure in a month.“It’s hard to see a rally until we have definitive news on a Western vaccine,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO at InfraCap in New York. “Until then, why would you want to get too long or too short oil?”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-stable-stimulus-hopes-run-222316934.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-19	2020-10-19 14:26:26	COP	ConocoPhillips	Looking Into ConocoPhillips's Return On Capital Employed	During Q2, ConocoPhillips's (NYSE: COP) reported sales totaled $4.02 billion. Despite a 849.09% in earnings, the company posted a loss of $1.04 billion. ConocoPhillips collected $4.81 billion in revenue during Q1, but reported earnings showed a $110.00 million loss.What Is Return On Capital Employed? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in ConocoPhillips's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q2, ConocoPhillips posted an ROCE of -0.03%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on COPReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.In ConocoPhillips's case, the ROCE ratio shows the amount of assets may not be helping the company achieve higher returns. Investors may take this into account before making any long-term financial decisions.Q2 Earnings Insight ConocoPhillips reported Q2 earnings per share at $-0.92/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $-0.58/share.See more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * A Look Into ConocoPhillips's Debt  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For September 25, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-19	2020-10-19 13:34:33	COP	ConocoPhillips	Conoco to Buy Concho for $9.7 Billion to Create Shale Giant	(Bloomberg) -- ConocoPhillips agreed to buy Concho Resources Inc. for about $9.7 billion in stock, the largest shale industry deal since the collapse in energy demand earlier this year and one that will create a heavyweight driller in America’s most prolific oil field.Investors will get 1.46 Conoco shares for each Concho share, the companies said Monday in a statement. The transaction represents a 15% premium over Concho’s closing price on Oct. 13, the last trading session before Bloomberg News first reported the companies were in talks.The pandemic-induced price crash and lackluster global economic recovery have accelerated the push for consolidation across the shale patch, which is under severe financial strain after years of debt-fueled growth. The combination of Conoco and Concho will be one of the dominant operators in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, rivaling only the likes of Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Chevron Corp. in terms of crude output.The deal may also signal further mergers and acquisitions in the sector. Despite a compelling rationale for more consolidation in order to cut costs, a lack of cash and Wall Street’s antipathy toward the sector has, until recently, made it hard to get deals across the line.But with oil stable at around $40 a barrel, there are signs that M&A is now gaining momentum. Chevron Corp. completed its acquisition of Noble Energy Inc. in early October, and in late September Devon Energy Corp. announced it was buying Permian operator WPX Energy Inc. Unlike some shale deals in 2019, Devon’s tie-up with WPX was well-received, with both companies agreeing on a small deal premium. That follows investor criticism of some deal premiums last year for being excessive.Concho’s shares rose 0.7% to $48.96 at 9:32 a.m. in New York while Conoco’s dropped 0.3% to $33.67.The Concho takeover is Conoco’s biggest under its current chief executive officer, Ryan Lance, who until now has sought to position the company almost as an anti-shale option for Wall Street, touting little-to-no-growth, steady cash flow and disciplined spending.While Lance has made no secret of his desire to take advantage of the downturn to expand in shale, he said in July that any transaction must meet Conoco’s criteria of having a low cost of supply while being able to compete with the rest of the company’s portfolio.Houston-based Conoco emerged from the oil market slump in a relatively strong position with about $7 billion of cash on hand. It recently resumed share buybacks. But its growth outlook is challenged: second-quarter production was down by almost 25% from a year earlier after it joined many other U.S. drillers in curbing output in response to lower prices.Conoco and Concho said on a conference call that the deal didn’t arise from a need to fix anything but rather a desire to bulk up.“Evaluating the go-forward size and scale really becomes more and more important,” Concho CEO Tim Leach, who will be executive vice president and president of the merged companies’ operations in the lower 48 U.S. states, said on the call. “The ‘why now’ is that we have common vision on this, and creating a company that can attract capital and be a leader in that regard is the compelling reason why we wanted to move now.”Adding Concho will dramatically alter Conoco’s production profile. The Midland, Texas-based shale company is entirely focused on the Permian and pumped 319,000 barrels in the second quarter, about six times what Conoco produced there.The combination will save $500 million a year by 2022, and hand shareholders more than 30 percent of cash from operations through dividends and other distributions, the companies said.Concho “was an attractive company and had one of the deepest tier 1 resource bases in shale,” analysts at Wells Fargo said in a note. With a deal premium of 15% along with the projected efficiencies, Conoco “seems to be getting a bargain.”What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“With Concho Resources’ stock down more than 40% in 2020, its sale to ConocoPhillips at a 15% premium to the Oct. 13 close may not assuage holders of a best-in-class Permian E&P that’s generating free cash flow and has less burdensome debt than smaller, independent peers. Concho had laid out a reasonable road map of modest production married with capital efficiency, and we thought it would be a consolidator, even given CEO Tim Leach’s history of selling two other iterations of Concho.”\--Vincent Piazza, senior industry analyst, and Evan Lee, associate analystClick here to read the reportThough the transaction may be good for shareholders, the extensive cost cuts mean it’s unlikely to benefit already declining U.S. oil production, or the companies like Halliburton Co. who provide drilling and other services. Halliburton said Monday that business outside the U.S. is still weak.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is Conoco’s financial adviser on the deal and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is its legal adviser. Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are Concho’s financial advisers and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP is its legal adviser.(Updates with Concho CEO’s comment in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conoco-buy-concho-9-7-110615611.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-12	2020-10-12 08:51:33	COP	ConocoPhillips	ConocoPhillips Boosts Dividend 2.4%; Street Bullish On Outlook	ConocoPhillips (COP) has revealed a 2.4% increase in its quarterly dividend from 42 cents per share to 43 cents per share, equating to an incremental $43 million in annual dividend payments.This translates into a forward dividend yield of 4.78%. The dividend is payable on Dec. 1, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business on Oct. 19, 2020.Shares in COP have plunged 46% year-to-date, but the oil and natural gas giant nevertheless scores a Strong Buy consensus from the Street. That’s with 12 recent buy ratings vs just 2 hold ratings. Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $48 indicates 37% upside potential lies ahead.“The dividend increase, coupled with the recently announced restart of the share repurchase program, demonstrate the company’s financial strength and confidence in the macro outlook” cheered RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold on October 9.Indeed, at the end of September, COP revealed plans to resume share repurchases of $1 billion during 4Q20 under its existing authorization using cash on its balance sheet. At 2Q20 the company had $14.8 billion of authorizations remaining under its share repurchase program.As a result, Hanold reiterated his buy rating on COP with a $50 price target (42% upside potential). He noted that COP has the ability to execute these buybacks through most cycles given its significant cash balance and financial strength.And according to the analyst, “the dividend increase should provide investors with incremental confidence the company can continue to grow free cash flow distributions while funding its future development program.” (See COP stock analysis on TipRanks)Related News:  Total Leads Investment Into Fuel-Cell Truck Maker Hyzon  Tesla’s 3Q Deliveries Top Wall Street Expectations  Vale Teams Up With China Port In Savvy JV; Analysts Bullish More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * GM China 3Q Vehicle Sales Jump 12%; Merrill Lynch Sees 87% Upside   * Wix Teams Up With Vodafone For UK Expansion; Shares Now Up 138% YTD   * J&J;’s Tremfya Study Shows Improvement In Crohn’s Disease Patients   * Opko’s BioReference Lab Begins Covid-19 Testing At NYC Schools	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conocophillips-boosts-dividend-2-4-085133472.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-08	2020-10-08 12:37:50	COP	ConocoPhillips	Conoco, Mercuria Cashed In on Power Trades During Heat Wave	(Bloomberg) -- The August heat wave that scorched the U.S. West and triggered blackouts in California appears to have been lucrative for some commodity traders playing the region’s power market.Mercuria Energy America LLC, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Tenaska Power Services Co. and Berkshire Hathaway’s PacifiCorp utility were among traders who sold power above $1,000 a megawatt-hour, the price cap set in the Western Electric Coordination Council, which oversees the regional energy market. Together they made at least 40 sales, according to filings they submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday.In some cases, the sales called for exporting electricity from California at a time when supplies there were already scarce. Some of those exports were curtailed by authorities.The disclosures come as California regulators dissect the causes behind the state’s first rolling blackouts since the 2001 energy crisis. During the heat wave, electricity prices skyrocketed as grid operators struggled to meet rising demand and as power plants tripped offline. State officials on Tuesday said that flaws in the state’s power markets contributed to the outages.In their filings, the traders said the extreme conditions justified the sales. They also said there were no signs of market manipulation, such as megawatt laundering or gaming strategies, in their trades. Finally, they all noticed prices rose to at least $1,600 a megawatt-hour at the Palo Verde hub in Arizona, with some of them citing financial contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange, according to the filings.Tenaska said in a statement that the unprecedented heat wave drove prices above $1,000 a megawatt-hour for two days and that it complied with rules requiring it to explain to regulators why its sales above the price cap were justified. Mercuria and PacifiCorp didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment sent outside normal business hours. Conoco didn’t have an immediate comment. Shell declined to comment.More on the transactions:Mercuria made seven spot sales to DTE Energy Trading Inc. and two each to Uniper Global Commodities North America LLC and Conoco.Tenaska made six spot sales which included some exports. Those were curtailed by California’s grid operator on Aug. 18. The trader said it faced significant losses if its own suppliers failed to deliver.Shell did 13 bilateral spot sales on Aug. 18 and 19 above $1,000 at Mead, Palo Verde, Four Corners and Mona.Berkshire Hathaway’s PacifiCorp said it was a price taker on seven transactions that were priced above cap, citing the higher prices that settled on the Intercontinental Exchange contracts.Conoco made spot transactions at Palo Verde and the Mead delivery point in Nevada. On Aug. 18, one of its scheduled deliveries was cut for three hours because of a transmission curtailment. Discussions about potential damages between it and two parties are ongoing.Exelon Corp. identified a single transaction that came in above the cap, which took place after being asked by a broker to help execute a transaction as a credit-worthy counterparty. The day-ahead sale involved 14 megawatts from Rainbow Energy Marketing Corp. to a unit of Citigroup Inc. to be delivered at the Palo Verde hub on Aug. 19. Exelon made a $112 profit on that trade through a fee. Exelon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside normal business hours.(Adds Tenaska statement in the sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conoco-mercuria-cashed-power-trades-003702586.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-10-05	2020-10-05 16:35:21	COP	ConocoPhillips	Buy These 3 Dividend Stocks on Weakness, Say Analysts	"The conventional wisdom would say that a stock with low share value and falling revenues and earnings would not be a great buying proposition. But the conventional wisdom also said that nothing would replace the horse in transportation, and that Hillary Clinton would be President. Sometimes, it pays to look under the hood, and see what’s really driving events – or stock potentials.And that is what several Wall Street analysts have done. In three recent reports, these analysts have highlighted stocks that all show the same combination of features: A Strong Buy consensus view, a high upside potential, a high dividend yield – and a strongly depressed share price. The analysts point to that share price weakness as an opportunity for investors.We ran the tickers through TipRanks database to find out what made these stocks compelling.ConocoPhillips (COP)First on the list is ConocoPhillips, the world’s largest oil and gas production company, with over $35 billion in annual revenues, $7 billion in annual income, and a market cap exceeding $36 billion. ConocoPhillips is based in Houston, Texas, and has operation in 17 countries. Just under half of the company’s 2019 production came from the US.With all of that strength behind it, COP shares are down 46% year-to-date. The key is low oil prices, which are depressing earnings. In the second quarter, the company recorded a net loss per share of 92 cents. The loss comes on the heels of declines prices; COP’s crude oil realized an average price of $25.10 per barrel, down 61% year-over-year, and natural gas liquids brought in $9.88 per barrel equivalent, a 54% yoy decline. Top line revenues fell 55% to $2.75 billion.Despite the falling revenues and earnings, COP has kept up its dividend payment. The company raised the payment from 31 cents to 42 cents last autumn, and the recent quarterly payment, sent out in early September, marked four quarters in a row at that level – and 5 years of dividend reliability. At $1.68 per common share annually, the dividend yields 5.08%.JPMorgan analyst Phil Gresh notes ConocoPhillips’ solid balance sheet and free cash flow, and points out the company’s logical path forward.“COP announced its intention to buy back $1B of stock with cash on hand, which we think is an acknowledgement that management views the stock as being over-sold, even considering the commodity price environment. We tend to agree with this view... COP continues to have plenty of cash and short-term investments on hand to be opportunistic with its capital allocation,” Gresh opined.Accordingly, Gresh rates COP an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $49 price target implies an upside of 44%. (To watch Gresh’s track record, click here)Overall, the Strong Buy consensus rating on COP shares is based on 13 reviews, including 11 Buys and 2 Holds. The stock sells for $33.90 and has an average price target of $48.08, in line with Gresh’s. (See COP stock analysis on TipRanks)Baker Hughes Company (BKR)Next up is Baker Hughes, an oil field support services company. These are the companies that supply the tech needed to make oil well work. The exploration companies own the rights and bring in the heavy equipment, but it’s the support service providers who send in the roughneck drillers and the tools that complete the wells and keep them in operation. Baker Hughes offers technical services to all segments of the oil industry, upstream, midstream, and downstream.Providing an essential set of services and products has not protected Baker Hughes from the prevailing low oil prices. BKR shares have underperformed, and are down 48% year-to-date. The company’s earnings and revenue fell sequentially in both Q1 and Q2, with second quarter EPS turning negative at a 5-cent loss per share. Revenue fell 12% to $4.7 billion for the quarter.Like COP above, Baker Hughes has made a point of maintaining its dividend. The company’s dividend has been reliable for the past 21 year – an enviable record – and management has prioritized that reputation. The payment, of 18 cents per common share quarterly, annualizes to 72 cents and gives a robust yield of 5.6%.Writing from RBC, analyst Kurt Hallead sees Baker Hughes at the start of a new path forward.“BKR's strategy is to shed its oil services skin and transition into a global Energy Technology company. As many industries aggressively pursue carbon reduction targets and increase spend on renewable energy, BKR's plan is to lever its technology portfolio and position its core businesses for new frontiers, notably carbon capture, hydrogen and energy storage,” Hallead noted. ""In our opinion, pivoting to Energy Technology from Oil Services will be key to maintaining relevancy with investors, ensuring long-term viability with customers and outperforming its peers. BKR's strong balance sheet and FCF generation provide a firm foundation. BKR is the only Energy Technology Services company on both the RBC Global ESG Best Ideas list and the RBC Global Energy Best Ideas list,"" Hallead concluded.Hallead is optimistic about the company’s ability to effect this transition, as shown by his $20 price target, suggesting an upside of 55%. (To watch Hallead’s track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street agrees with Hallead on BKR. Of 12 reviews, 9 are Buys and 3 are Holds, making the consensus rating a Strong Buy. The average price target is $20.27, implying an upside of 58% from the trading price of $12.86. (See BKR stock analysis on TipRanks)Enerplus (ERF)Last on our list is Enerplus, another exploration and production company in North America’s oil and gas market. Enerplus operates in the Marcellus shale of Pennsylvania, producing natural gas, in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana, producing light oil, and in several oil assets in Western Canada. The company estimates 2020 average production of 89,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And with all that to back it up, this small-cap ($419 million) energy player has seen its stock fall 73% this year.A 45% drop in top-line revenue, and earnings falling to a net loss of 14 cents per share in Q2, haven’t helped, but the real culprit, as with the companies above, is the current low oil price regime. The COVID-19 pandemic hit energy producers from several directions at once: reduced demand as economic activity declined, disruptions to production as workers were placed under stay-home orders, and disruptions to trade networks for both of those reasons.And yet, through all of this, Enerplus has consistently paid out its monthly dividend. The payment is small – only 1 cent in Canadian currency, or slightly less than 1 cent in US money – but the stock’s share price is low, as well. As a result, the 9 cent (US) annualized dividend payment gives a fairly robust yield of 4.8%.Analyst Greg Pardy, of RBC, watches the North American oil industry – especially the Canadian segments – carefully, and he believes Enerplus sits in a strong position to weather a tough market. “Enerplus remains our favorite intermediate producer given its consistent operational performance and best-in-class balance sheet… Liquidity wise, Enerplus is in excellent shape… [and] essentially undrawn on its US$600 million bank credit facility. Following repayments in May and June, Enerplus has no further debt maturities in 2020,” the analyst cheered. In line with this optimistic assessment, Pardy gives ERF a C$5.00 (US$3.76) price target indicating an upside of 100% for the coming year. (To watch Pardy’s track record, click here)All in all, with an 8:1 split between Buy and Hold, Enerplus’ 9 recent reviews support the Strong Buy analyst consensus. The share price is $1.85, and the US$3.72 average price target suggests it has room for 97% growth in the year ahead.

2020-10-05	2020-10-05 16:35:21	COP	ConocoPhillips	Buy These 3 Dividend Stocks on Weakness, Say Analysts	"
<meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" /><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The conventional wisdom would say that a stock with low share value and falling revenues and earnings would not be a great buying proposition. But the conventional wisdom also said that nothing would replace the horse in transportation, and that Hillary Clinton would be President. Sometimes, it pays to look under the hood, and see what’s really driving events – or stock potentials.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that is what several Wall Street analysts have done. In three recent reports, these analysts have highlighted stocks that all show the same combination of features: A Strong Buy consensus view, a high upside potential, a high dividend yield – and a strongly depressed share price. The analysts point to that share price weakness as an opportunity for investors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We ran the tickers through <a href=""http://www.tipranks.com"">TipRanks database</a> to find out what made these stocks compelling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>ConocoPhillips (<a href=""https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cop/price-target"">COP</a>)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First on the list is ConocoPhillips, the world’s largest oil and gas production company, with over $35 billion in annual revenues, $7 billion in annual income, and a market cap exceeding $36 billion. ConocoPhillips is based in Houston, Texas, and has operation in 17 countries. Just under half of the company’s 2019 production came from the US.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all of that strength behind it, COP shares are down 46% year-to-date. The key is low oil prices, which are depressing earnings. In the second quarter, the company recorded a net loss per share of 92 cents. The loss comes on the heels of declines prices; COP’s crude oil realized an average price of $25.10 per barrel, down 61% year-over-year, and natural gas liquids brought in $9.88 per barrel equivalent, a 54% yoy decline. Top line revenues fell 55% to $2.75 billion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the falling revenues and earnings, COP has kept up its dividend payment. The company raised the payment from 31 cents to 42 cents last autumn, and the recent quarterly payment, sent out in early September, marked four quarters in a row at that level – and 5 years of dividend reliability. At $1.68 per common share annually, the dividend yields 5.08%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>JPMorgan analyst <a href=""https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/phil-gresh"">Phil Gresh</a> notes ConocoPhillips’ solid balance sheet and free cash flow, and points out the company’s logical path forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“COP announced its intention to buy back $1B of stock with cash on hand, which we think is an acknowledgement that management views the stock as being over-sold, even considering the commodity price environment. We tend to agree with this view... COP continues to have plenty of cash and short-term investments on hand to be opportunistic with its capital allocation,” Gresh opined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Accordingly, Gresh rates COP an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $49 price target implies an upside of 44%. (To watch Gresh’s track record, <a href=""https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/phil-gresh""><strong>click here</strong></a>)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Strong Buy consensus rating on COP shares is based on 13 reviews, including 11 Buys and 2 Holds. The stock sells for $33.90 and has an average price target of $48.08, in line with Gresh’s. (<a href=""https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cop/forecast"">See COP stock analysis on TipRanks</a>)</p>

2020-08-17	2020-08-17 18:09:33	COP	ConocoPhillips	Trump Plans Arctic Drilling Rights Sale in Likely 2020 Clash	(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration on Monday authorized a sweeping plan to sell drilling rights and spur oil development in Alaska’s rugged Arctic refuge, setting up a possible auction by the end of 2020 and a political clash if the president loses the November election.The Interior Department’s decision approves oil leasing across the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge’s entire 1.56-million-acre coastal plain -- an area the size of Delaware that’s home to polar bears and caribou. Though Congress earmarked the area for possible energy development in 1980, it has remained off-limits to oil drilling for decades.“The establishment of this program is a major milestone,” Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in an interview. “It’s not the end of the leasing process, but it is a very, very significant milestone.”The decision sets the stage for the federal government to potentially auction Arctic drilling rights in the final quarter of 2020 -- and a possible confrontation next year if President Donald Trump doesn’t win re-election. Democratic nominee Joe Biden said he’s “totally opposed” to drilling in the Arctic refuge, having called the idea a “big disaster” in a February town hall meeting.Although the refuge has long beckoned the energy sector with the potential for mammoth oil discoveries, it is unclear whether companies will aggressively bid on the territory, as low crude prices and an epic downturn in fuel demand from the coronavirus spur drillers to idle rigs and curtail new spending across the U.S. Legal uncertainties and public opposition to Arctic drilling also could dissuade some activity.Read More: Wall Street Is Bending to Pressure to Halt Arctic Oil LoansTrump didn’t make a clear commitment to a sale during a Monday interview on Fox News. “We are looking at it,” he said, before adding, “we did do ANWR.”Congress mandated an Arctic oil and gas program three years ago, with a law requiring Interior to sell drilling rights and facilitate development in the coastal plain. Under the 2017 Republican tax overhaul, the Interior Department must hold at least one auction of coastal plain oil leases before Dec. 22, 2021 and another by Dec. 22, 2024. Congress also required Interior to issue rights-of-way and easements necessary to support oil exploration and production.The record of the decision signed Monday is anchored by those congressional mandates, which Bernhardt said provide “far greater assurances to potential leaseholders” that they will have the ability to access, explore and develop operations.The approach is meant to help buttress Trump’s Arctic oil plans, which environmentalists have vowed to challenge in court, while making it harder for a future administration to reverse course.“Congress has mandated these lease sales” and “they have to go forward in some regard,” Bernhardt said in a call with reporters Monday. “They can’t just simply unduly delay.”Environmentalists argue Arctic oil development imperils one of the country’s last truly wild places -- a swath of northeast Alaska populated by Arctic foxes, polar bears, caribou herds and more than 200 species of birds. Canada has repeatedly warned about the potential for harm to the Porcupine caribou herd that forages and calves in the area.The Interior Department has acknowledged that its plans would affect large portions of critical habitat and denning areas for polar bears, including a dwindling Southern Beaufort Sea population. “The potential for injury or mortality could be high when developing new oil and gas projects in polar bear habitat,” Interior’s Bureau of Land Management said in an environmental analysis last year.“An oil spill in this special sanctuary could devastate polar bears and caribou and cause irreparable harm to a pristine Arctic ecosystem,” said Kristen Monsell, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity. “We’ve reached a dangerous new low in the Trump administration’s obsession with expanding the extraction of dirty fossil fuels.”Conservationists vowed to challenge the administration’s move, which they said was fundamentally flawed and rested on insufficiently narrow environmental analysis of oil leasing and development in the Arctic.Bear Buffer Zones“This is another outrageous move by an administration that ignores science and shortcuts the public process in an irresponsible rush to help oil companies secure leases on the coastal plain before the 2020 presidential election,” said Karlin Itchoak, with The Wilderness Society.The Interior Department rejected narrower alternatives that would put less acreage up for grabs and impose more restrictions. The agency is establishing buffer zones around polar bear dens and timing limitations on activity during Porcupine caribou calving season, but conservationists have said the planned safeguards are inadequate.The Interior Department still must issue a formal “call for nominations” seeking input on specific tracts and take public comment before scheduling a sale.Under the approved plan, surface activity will be off-limits in 23% of the 1.56 million acres (632,726 hectares) available for oil leasing. Timing limitations will be imposed on 37% of the area to help protect habitat and wildlife. Further site-specific limitations could be embedded in leases and future permits, Bernhardt said.The U.S. Geological Survey has estimated the refuge’s coastal plain might hold between 4.3 billion and 11.8 billion barrels of technically recoverable crude. A large discovery there could produce oil for decades, rivaling output even from the nearby Prudhoe Bay field.Yet relatively few companies have the resources to mount costly operations in the remote region, and major U.S. banks have sworn off financing Arctic oil projects in response to environmental pressure.With crude now trading near $40 a barrel following an unprecedented crash in oil prices, U.S. drillers also have been in retrenchment mode -- scaling back spending instead of exploring for new oil. There are only 172 oil rigs active in the whole of America, the lowest since 2005. And some potential coastal plain bidders, such as Oil Search Ltd., have recently pared back operations.Nevertheless, the industry still welcomed the administration’s move to open up a new front for exploration.Energy ‘Renaissance’ConocoPhillips, Alaska’s biggest producer, is advancing oil projects in the National Petroleum Reserve located in the northwest part of the state, while charting plans to expand. Governor Michael Dunleavy said last year that Conoco would help drive an energy “renaissance” in Alaska after years of production declines. On Monday, Dunleavy said the Trump administration’s plan “will lead to the responsible development of Alaska’s abundant resources, create new jobs, support economic growth and prosperity” and ensure the state continues playing a critical role in U.S. energy “well into the future.”“Industry interest for the Arctic refuge is particularly hard to predict” as many companies have kept quiet, observed the progressive Center for American Progress, which opposes the plan. “They must weigh, among other things, the huge expense and risk of new development in the Arctic; the certainty of costly and protracted litigation; and the uncertainty of whether there are any oil and gas resources.”A future president who opposes Arctic drilling could slow-walk selling leases or permitting wells in the coastal plain. While that resistance could in turn be challenged, the ensuing litigation might span years.Already, concerns about polar bears and work schedules have prevented new geological surveys to better pinpoint potential oil reserves -- foreshadowing future hurdles.(Updates with oil industry details from fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-charts-arctic-drilling-rights-123000227.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-08-16	2020-08-16 07:12:58	COP	ConocoPhillips	ConocoPhillips Snags Approval For Major Alaska Oil Project	The Bureau of Land Management has approved ConocoPhillips’ (COP) proposed Willow Master Development Plan (MDP) for drilling in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve.According to the bureau’s final environmental impact statement (EIS), the Willow MDP Project could produce in excess of 160,000 barrels of oil per day (with a processing capacity of 200,000 barrels of oil per day) over its anticipated 30-year life, producing up to approximately 590 million total barrels of oil.More than 1,000 jobs are expected during peak construction with more than 400 jobs during operations- which will help offset declines in production from the North Slope oil fields and contribute to the local economy.“This project would provide more access to valuable resources in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska,” said BLM Alaska State Director Chad Padgett.  “It provides for more throughput in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, ultimately providing for more jobs for Alaskans and creating more revenue for the State.”The preferred alternative in the Final EIS allows for construction of up to five drill sites and associated processing and support facilities, including gravel roads and pipelines to provide access to federal leases.This alternative incorporates modifications to the project to reduce impacts based on input from tribal governments, cooperating agencies, and various other stakeholders, the BLM said.Shares in COP are down 37% year-to-date, and the stock shows a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy Street consensus. That’s alongside an average analyst price target of $52 (26% upside potential).RBC Capital’s Scott Hanold has a buy rating on Conoco with a $50 price target. “We expect the company returns to positive FCF in 3Q20 (excluding dividends) and is well positioned to benefit from continued price improvements with no hedges” the analyst wrote.He added that COP separates itself from the pack with the sustainability of FCF through cycles but investors are looking for guidance as “the uncertainty on commodity prices appears to make formal guidance a bit elusive for now.” (See COP’s stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  DraftKings Sinks As IRS Tax Threat Hits; Street Stays Bullish  Altria vs Philip Morris: Which Stock Is A More Compelling Buy?

Natural gas prices have come under pressure from reduced consumption as efforts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a drop in manufacturing activities, while cancelled LNG exports have led to high natural gas inventories.

2020-07-30	2020-07-30 19:41:26	COP	ConocoPhillips	Oil Slides Most in a Month on Grim Economic Signals	(Bloomberg) -- Oil cratered the most in more than a month after data showed the U.S. economy had its worst contraction on record, with demand expected to languish as millions of Americans remain out of work.U.S. benchmark crude futures tumbled 3.3%, closing at the lowest level in three weeks. Equities in the U.S., Europe and Asia weakened, with the S&P 500 Index spiraling lower by as much as 1.7%.Government data showed the U.S. economy suffered its sharpest downturn since at least the 1940s in the second quarter, pointing to how the coronavirus pandemic has devastated businesses across the country. In a further signal of the economic pain, the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits increased for a second straight week. Elsewhere, Germany’s economy shrank the most in at least half a century in the second quarter.“The slew of very worrying economic data overnight and this morning is really weighing on the complex,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC. The gross domestic product declines in Germany and the U.S. “does not bode well for gasoline demand.”Futures in New York have been trading around $40 a barrel since early June with market volatility depressed as a resurgent coronavirus pandemic continues to sour the outlook for a steady demand recovery. Royal Dutch Shell Plc Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said oil demand may not see a full recovery until next year.On the supply side, OPEC+ alliance is days away from unleashing crude back onto the market following historic output cuts, and in the U.S., ConocoPhillips is the latest explorer to announce it’s bringing back oil production as prices climb from historic lows back in April. Shale producers Continental Resources Inc., Parsley Energy Inc. and EOG Resources Inc. have said they would restore some curtailed output in July.Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump raised the notion of delaying the Nov. 3 election until after the pandemic eases, though he lacks the authority to do so without the consent of lawmakers who have already rejected the idea.“It didn’t help that Trump tweeted out that maybe we should delay the election,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member of the global macro program at Tyche Capital Advisors LLC. In combination with the weak economic data points, it “started the whole day off with a risk-off attitude.”Virus relief talks in U.S. Congress could ease negative sentiment. Senate Republicans moved forward with a plan to set up votes on extending lapsed supplemental unemployment insurance as talks on a broader relief package were at a standstill.“It does seem like we’re kind of settling into a new normal around this $40 a barrel area,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group Inc. “To get out of this trading range, to get back up to the higher mid-40s again, it’s probably going to take another shot of stimulus.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-buoyed-shrinking-american-stockpiles-061235800.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-07-30	2020-07-30 13:31:40	COP	ConocoPhillips	How Does ConocoPhillips's Debt Look Like?	Shares of ConocoPhillips Inc. (NYSE: COP) moved lower by 6.23% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt ConocoPhillips has.ConocoPhillips's Debt According to the ConocoPhillips's most recent financial statement as reported on May 5, 2020, total debt is at $14.97 billion, with $14.85 billion in long-term debt and $126.00 million in current debt. Adjusting for $3.91 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $11.06 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering ConocoPhillips's $65.03 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.23. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry, whereas average for another.Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Earnings Scheduled For July 30, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The company said it had net income of $300 million, or 24 cents a share, down from $1.6 billion, or $1.40 a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, the company had an adjusted loss per share of 92 cents, wider than the 58 cents loss consensus of FactSet analysts. Special items were mostly a realized gain on the completion of the Australia-West divestiture and an unrealized gain on Cenovus Energy equity. &quot;Headline second-quarter performance was dominated by weak realized prices, coupled with our rational economic action to curtail production in favor of expected higher future prices,&quot; Chief Executive Ryan Lance said in a statement.

It curtailed about 225 Mboed. &quot;he company continues to monitor netback pricing and evaluate curtailments across our assets on a month-by-month basis,&quot; it said.

2020-07-28	2020-07-28 09:00:18	COP	ConocoPhillips	Socially Conscious Investing Thrives Amid Pandemic	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- At the moment when so many industries are staggered by the coronavirus pandemic, investors are beating the market by putting their money in companies committed to environmental, social and governance priorities favoring transparency, diversity and sustainability.ESG is where profits are, signaling that doing the right thing increasingly is the smartest bet. The iShares exchange-traded fund investing in companies it thinks have “positive environmental, social and governance characteristics,” one of the largest of the type, produced a total return this year that is more than three times the performance of S&P 500 index.The convergence of high-mindedness and profit was noted this month by Al Gore, the former vice president, 2000 Democratic presidential candidate and Oscar-winning environmental documentarian. He told a Bloomberg conference, “It is ever clearer that sustainable technologies are cheaper and better.”For more and more companies, doing the right thing is becoming as much a business imperative as a social responsibility, especially in the market for renewable energy. Apple Inc., the Cupertino, California maker of personal computing and mobile communication devices that has appreciated 30% this year, recently unveiled its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire manufacturing supply chain and product life cycle by 2030. Nike Inc., the Beaverton, Oregon designer and manufacturer of athletic shoes and apparel, is part of the RE100 coalition of companies planning to supply all energy needs from renewable sources by 2025.“Long term, renewables could emerge stronger than ever, especially if governments integrate support for clean energy into Covid-19 economic-recovery programs,” said a report in May by the Yale School of Environment.That’s already reflected in the anticipated performance of 38 U.S.-based companies generating at least 50% of their revenue from clean-energy products or clean technology. As a group, their sales are expected to rise 9% this year, 30% in 2021 and 23% in 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.By contrast, the 26 corporations in the S&P 500 Energy Index, a benchmark for fossil fuel, will suffer revenue declines of 29% in 2020, followed by growth of 11% in 2021 and 13% in 2022, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.The phenomenon of ESG stocks outperforming the market is a long-term trend accentuated by the coronavirus. The 38 clean companies produced a 254% total return (income plus appreciation) in the past 12 months, 250% during the past 2 years and 330% since 2015. Among them, Palo-Alto-based Tesla Inc.’s 1-year return is 575%, including 130% since March when the coronavirus prompted much of the U.S. economy to shut down.Enphase Energy Inc., the renewable-energy equipment maker based in Petaluma, California, gained 199% the past year, including 27% since March. Lehi, Utah-based Vivint Solar Inc. is up 192% over the past 12 months and 107% since March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Traditional energy companies in the S&P 500 Energy Index lost 35%, 46% and 33%, respectively, for the 1, 2, and 5-year periods. Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil declined 38% during the past year, including 13% since March. Houston-based Conoco Phillips is down 30% over 12 months, including 16% since March. Kinder Morgan Inc., the Houston pipeline transportation and energy storage provider, tumbled 28% during the past year, including 25% since March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Since March, when the pandemic proved its virulence, ESG’s advantage over the market doubled. That’s reflected in the distance between the performance of BlackRock’s iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, one of the largest exchange-traded funds investing in renewable energy and clean technology, and State Street’s Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund, one of the largest ETFs investing in traditional energy companies. The fossil fuel crowd is getting crushed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Anyone who thinks that ESG investors are more lucky than smart, or a trendy cohort of woke millennials, should consider the divergence between Aramco and Tesla. Aramco, the Saudi oil giant that remains for now the world’s largest company, was valued at more than $2 trillion after its initial public offering in December. Since then, Tesla’s market capitalization quadrupled to $286 billion passing Toyota Motor Corp. to become the world’s biggest automaker. During the same period, Aramco declined 15% to $1.7 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The gap between Aramco and Tesla narrowed $500 billion, a little more than the $467 billion value of the world’s 9th-largest company. That would be Berkshire Hathaway, created by Warren Buffett, once the world’s richest man and the avatar of value investing. He’s shown no inclination to move toward ESG.

2020-07-25	2020-07-25 14:41:59	COP	ConocoPhillips	SunTrust Likes Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Neutral On Exxon	SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts initiated coverage of the three major U.S.-based oil giants but suggested only two should be bought by investors.The Analyst: Welles Fitzpatrick initiated coverage of the following three stocks:  * Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) at Buy with a $120 price target.  * ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) at Buy with a $51 price target.  * Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) at Hold with a $41 price target.Dividend Policy: The three majors are known for offering low risk and stable dividend and the recent oil downturn forced the companies to defend payouts, even at the expense of cutting capex, accumulating new debt or shedding assets, Fitzpatrick wrote in the initiation note.The three companies offer investors a yield ranging from 4% to 8% versus a 20-year average of around 3% to 4%. The premium versus historical norms implies there are some concerns about the longer-term sustainability of dividends.Among the three companies, Chevron's dividend is the &quot;most sustainable&quot; and ConocoPhillips has more upside if oil trades north of $70. Exxon can't organically cover its dividend obligations until 2022 or beyond unless there is a recovery in its refining business.Cashflow: Oil and gas production accounts for around 90% of estimated 2022 cash flow for ConocoPhillips, followed by Chevron at 70% and 30% at Exxon. If product pricing moves up 10% and oil pricing stays flat, Exxon would have a free cash flow yield of 7% which allows it to cover capex and dividends organically. Chevron would still offer a better free cash flow yield at 11% and Exxon would look &quot;more attractive&quot; in this scenario.2020 Outlook And beyond: All three companies will lower their production in 2020 before stabilizing in 2021, the analyst wrote. All three companies have &quot;gone big&quot; in unconventional production, especially in the Permian region.Companies with large scale projects that only have the tail end of capex left boast a near-term advantage. Chevron can count on Tengizchevroil while Exxon can count on Guyana.In fact, Guyana represents the majority of additional volumes for Exxon in 2022 and 2023 and Tengizchevroil should account for the majority of Chevron's 3% compounded annual growth through 2024. By contrast, ConocoPhillips offers less of a growth prospect but &quot;we still recognize the longer-term value,&quot; the analyst wrote.Related Links:OPEC Warns Second 'Strong Wave' Of Coronavirus Will Lead To Drop In Oil DemandUS Oil Imports Are Up In July: Why One Analyst Says Trend Unlikely To ContinueSee more from Benzinga  * Analyst Reacts To Disney Indefinitely Delaying 'Mulan' Release  * Fox Sports CEO: Baseball Is Back And Fans Are Excited  * Meet Chowbus: The Food Delivery Company Focused On Asian Restaurants(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

In June, the number of permits to drill wells in the U.S. rose by 15% on a month-over-month basis off a “brutal” May bottom, noted Evercore ISI analyst James West in a note.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/109a64ae-11a1-32a6-9ec8-c70f3287b0d4/u.s.-oil-companies-are.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-30	2020-06-30 21:09:00	COP	ConocoPhillips	Crude Posts Best Quarter Since 1990 After Historic Price Crash	(Bloomberg) -- Oil posted its best quarter in nearly 30 years, bouncing back from this year’s historic price crash.Futures in New York surged 92% in the three months through June 30th following crude’s worst quarter on record, buoyed by OPEC+ production cuts and rebounding oil consumption in post-lockdown China. The market’s climb from negative territory in April has been swift but bumpy, with the U.S. benchmark struggling to hold above $40 a barrel amid a stubborn supply glut and a resurgence of Covid-19 cases that’s darkened the demand outlook.“It’s not going to jump back up to $60 overnight, but to get to where we are now from where we were at is an incredible story,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group Inc. How quickly the market can complete its recovery is an open question. “Coming out of the rut will have to happen one day at a time,” he said.While demand is gradually improving, it’s still a long way off pre-crisis levels. In the U.S., a spike in virus cases is prompting many states to pause or reverse re-openings, which could curb summer travel just as fuel consumption was beginning to ramp up. Across the Atlantic, European Union governments extended a travel ban for U.S. residents.Rising American inventories are also weighing on prices, which are still down more than 30% so far this year. Crude stockpiles have expanded for the last three weeks to the highest level on record, while diesel supplies have swelled for 11 of the last 12 weeks.The tide may turn once the Energy Information Administration releases its latest inventory data on Wednesday. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude stockpiles declined 8.16 million barrels last week, according to people familiar with the data. If confirmed by the government report, it would be the largest draw since December. Supplies in Cushing, Oklahoma rose by 164,000 barrels, the report said.Rising prices have prompted some U.S. producers to restart wells they shuttered after the crash. ConocoPhillips said Tuesday it will restore some curtailed production next month.While increasing U.S. output complicates OPEC+’s goal of balancing the market, the producer alliance has made good on its historic pledge to cut production but almost 10 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia and Russia have both slashed exports to multi-year lows, supporting physical prices in some parts of the world.In another bright spot for the oil market, China’s recovery is continuing with manufacturing data for June beating estimates, pointing to stronger demand from the world’s largest consumer.“The worst is behind us,” Amin Nasser, chief executive officer of Saudi Aramco, said in an interview with consultant IHS Markit. “I’m very optimistic about the second half of this year. We see it in China today, it’s almost at 90%.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-edges-lower-getting-boost-064249270.html?.tsrc=rss

The energy giant said it &quot;will continue to make economically driven production decisions at the asset level in the months ahead.&quot; The company said curtailments in the second quarter mostly related to oil production, averaging 225 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) on a net basis. About 65% of curtailments were in the Lower 48, 15% in Alaska and 15% in the Surmont operation in Canada. The company is expecting second-quarter production volumes of 960 to 980 MBOED. &quot;Excluding Libya, and adjusting for closed dispositions and curtailments, production in the second quarter of 2020 is expected to be in line with the same period a year ago and approximately 5 percent below the first quarter of 2020,&quot; the company said in a statement. Shares were not active premarket, but have fallen 36% in the year to date, while the S&p 500  has fallen 6%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/af7b53de-39ed-3b52-9300-757db545d78c/conocophillips-to-restore.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-29	2020-06-29 20:53:53	COP	ConocoPhillips	U.S. Cases Rise 1.2%; Worst Yet to Come, WHO Says: Virus Update	(Bloomberg) -- New Jersey halted plans for indoor dining and New York City said it’s considering the same move as other U.S. states experience a surge in Covid-19 cases after reopening restaurants and bars. One of those states, Florida, reported a jump in its double-digit infection rate.Gilead Sciences Inc. said it will charge the U.S. government and other developed countries $390 per vial for its coronavirus-fighting drug remdesivir, or about $2,340 for a typical five-day course of treatment.Deaths from the virus surpassed 500,000 worldwide and confirmed cases exceeded 10 million as the World Health Organization warned that the worst is yet to come. Tokyo reported more incidences of the disease, daily deaths in Iran reached a record and cases in Austria rose to the highest level since mid-May.Key Developments:Global Tracker: Cases pass 10.1 million; deaths top 502,500Swedish Covid expert says the world still doesn’t understandTrump dismisses virus, polls and recession to tell winning storyReviving Britain’s economy is tough with an aging workforceBoutique Manhattan hotel turns into Covid fortress to surviveOne big question: Are we going back into lockdown?: QuickTakeSubscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg’s Prognosis team here.

The one-day increase trailed the seven-day average of 4.2% and was the lowest in a week.In Houston, where emergency rooms and intensive-care units have been strained by the influx of patients, the cohort of Covid-19 patients in ICUs below the age of 40 is about 15%, David Persse, the city’s director of emergency medical services, said during a media briefing on Monday.“They are extremely ill,” Persse said. “If they’re thinking, ‘I’ll get sick and then I’ll get over it,’ recognize that 15% of the people in ICUs now are in their 20s and 30s.”Since late May, calls to the city’s 911 system have soared by almost 40%, driven by respiratory-distress cases, Fire Chief Samuel Pena said during the briefing. Emergency rooms are getting backed up trying to admit the influx of patients and that’s delaying how quickly ambulances can return to service and respond to new 911 calls, he said.Unions Sue Vegas Casinos Over Virus Protection (4:30 p.m. NY)MGM Resorts International’s Bellagio and Signature Condominiums, as well as Caesars Entertainment Corp.’s Harrah’s, were sued by Las Vegas labor unions for allegedly failing to do enough to protect workers from Covid-19.The culinary workers and the bartenders unions filed a complaint Monday in federal court in Las Vegas claiming the hotel and casino operators wouldn’t immediately close and deep-clean areas where infected employees had worked and would require employees to continue working without immediate informing them that a co-worker had tested positive or conducting contact tracing to see if they had been exposed.“Nothing is more important to us than the safety of everyone inside of our properties,” MGM Resorts said in response to the lawsuit. “We have spent months working with health experts to create a comprehensive health and safety plan. We have offered free testing to all employees before they report to work and require it if they exhibit symptoms or have been exposed to someone who has tested positive.”Representatives of Caesars didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations.U.S. Cases Rise 1.2% (4 p.m. NY)Coronavirus cases in the U.S. rose by 29,182 as compared to the same time Sunday to 2.56 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News.

AMC initially planned a July 15 end to its four-month domestic closing, which was so devastating to the company that it warned it might go out of business. The first new big-budget film of the summer, “Tenet” from AT&T Inc.’s Warner Bros., was expected to come out on July 17.NHL Says 26 Players Have Tested Positive (3:15 p.m. NY)The National Hockey League said 26 players have tested positive for coronavirus.As of Monday, 250 players have reported to training and practice facilities for optional participation in reopening activities, the NHL said in a statement.Fifteen returning players tested positive while the league is also aware of 11 other players that have tested positive.The NHL said this month that training camps for 24 teams resuming play will open on July 10.N.J. Pauses Indoor Dining Plan for July 2 (2:58 p.m. NY)Governor Phil Murphy said he would pause New Jersey’s plans to restart indoor dining on July 2, citing concerns about such a “sedentary” activity especially among “outlier” bars and restaurants not following social distancing.This “brings me no joy to do this, but we have no choice,” Murphy said.New Jersey indoor dining, with capacity caps and other restrictions, had been scheduled to restart on July 2, four days before New York City was to do so. But New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday said skyrocketing cases in the South and West have prompted them to consider postponing dining’s return. Cuomo also cited the failure of some New York City residents to practice social distancing.10,000 Iran Health-Care Workers Have Virus (2:45 p.m. NY)Some 10,000 Iranian health-care workers have contracted the coronavirus and least 64 have died fighting the pandemic, Iraj Harirchi, Iran’s deputy health minister, said on state TV.On Monday, Iran reported its highest daily death toll from Covid-19 at 162.

The number of Covid-19 patients on ventilators reached 90, up from 84 a day earlier. Both of those numbers were also the highest since early May.Worst Yet to Come, WHO Chief Says (12:30 p.m. NY)Tomorrow marks six months since the World Health Organization became aware of the novel coronavirus, and the “worst is yet to come” given a lack of global solidarity, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, said at a briefing in Geneva.Some countries are experiencing a resurgence of cases and half the deaths are coming from the Americas, he said.“This virus can be suppressed and contained using the tools at hand,” and countries shouldn’t wait for a vaccine to deal with it, Tedros said, giving the examples of South Korea, Japan and Germany. “If any country is saying that contact-tracing is difficult, it is a lame excuse.”The WHO will send a team of researchers to China next week to study the virus’s origins, Tedros said.Europe to Extend Travel Ban for U.S. (12:30 p.m. NY)European Union governments are poised to extend a travel ban for U.S. residents for at least two weeks, according to a draft of a decision due to be formally adopted on Tuesday.The wording of the decision, seen by Bloomberg, signals that the ban disrupting both business and leisure travel across the Atlantic won’t be lifted until U.S. authorities control the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.California Cases Rise 2.5% (12:30 p.m. NY)California’s virus cases rose 2.5%, less than the seven-day average of 2.8%, for a total of 216,550 confirmed infections.

That may also lead to a larger-than-expected increase on Tuesday, it said.The state reported no new deaths Monday, keeping the number at 1,588.Planet Fitness Falls on Virus Report (11:30 a.m. NY)Planet Fitness Inc. fell as much as 6.3% following a news report that more than 200 people may have been exposed to the coronavirus at a West Virginia location of the gym chain.A client at the Planet Fitness gym in Morgantown tested positive for the virus, raising the possibility that patrons were exposed on June 24, said Mary Wade Burnside, a spokeswoman for the Monongalia County Health Department.Broadway to Stay Closed Until 2021: NYT (11:15 a.m. NY)New York City’s Broadway will remain closed for at least the rest of this year, according to a report in the New York Times.Many shows are signaling that they don’t expect a return to the stage until late winter or early spring, the Times reported.The Broadway League said Monday that theater owners and producers are ready to refund or exchange tickets previously purchased for shows through Jan. 3, the newspaper said.ConocoPhillips Curbs Return to Houston Office (11 a.m. NY)ConocoPhillips, the world’s largest independent oil explorer, is scaling back the reopening of its corporate headquarters in Houston after two weeks as the Covid-19 outbreak worsens.Attendance at the office will be on a voluntary basis, spokesman John Roper said in an email.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo expressed similar concerns Monday morning during an interview on NY1.“Around the country, a number of cities and states have been moving in the wrong direction,” de Blasio said. “We all love indoor dining, but we see problems with indoor dining.”The mayor said the city and state will make a decision within the next few days, as health officials are “paying attention to this lesson. We’re increasingly concerned.”Florida Cases, Positive Rate Rise (10:40 a.m. NY)Florida reported 146,341 Covid-19 cases on Monday, up 3.7% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 5.5% in the previous seven days.

Gone are any mention of “sustainable” and “unsustainable” surge capacity -- the descriptors that until now denoted non-ICU beds that can be converted to handle the overflow of patients.Instead, surge capacity is now divided between “phase 2” and “phase 3,” which account for 373 and 504 beds, respectively. Normal ICU capacity of 1,330 beds was 93% full as of Saturday, down from 100% in the middle of last week. The medical center, a cluster of hospitals, medical facilities and educational centers south of downtown, was among the systems stung by Governor Greg Abbott’s ban on elective surgeries last week in four metro areas to conserve bed space.U.K. Care Home Death Rate Higher Than Germany’s (9:30 a.m. NY)Covid-19 is killing Spanish and U.K. care home residents at a higher rate than in other countries.In the U.K., 5.3% of care home residents may have died from coronavirus infections, a figure 13 times worse than in Germany, according to a report by researchers from the London School of Economics. Of 15 countries analyzed the only one with a higher rate of Covid-19 fatalities was Spain, at 6.1%.U.K. Pubs Prep for $259 Million Spending Spree (9:14 a.m. NY)British consumers will open their wallets and spend about 210 million pounds ($259 million) at pubs this weekend, more than 70% higher than the average, the Centre for Economics and Business Research estimates.

2020-06-17	2020-06-17 12:48:26	COP	ConocoPhillips	Oil Declines on Signs of Rising U.S. Stockpiles, Covid Rebound	(Bloomberg) -- Oil fell as concerns about a second wave of coronavirus cases in China and signs of rising U.S. stockpiles weighed on the market.Futures in New York were 1.1% lower. Beijing is battling a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, forcing the government to close all schools and cancel more than 1,200 flights. It highlights the risk facing the oil market just as prices have recovered from their depths in April. Producer group OPEC expects the virus to keep fuel demand subdued for the rest of this year.Traders are also having to grapple with unprecedented levels of U.S. crude inventories. The American Petroleum Institute reported on Tuesday that supplies rose last week. If confirmed by government data later on Wednesday it would be a record high.“The rally in oil prices is taking a breather as bearish U.S. supply fundamentals return to the fore,” PVM Oil Associates analysts Tamas Varga and Stephen Brennock wrote in a report.With crude in New York drawing closer to $40 a barrel, there are signs of returning production in North America. ConocoPhillips will bring back its curtailed supply in Alaska from July, while the volume of shut production in the Bakken region is also declining.Still, there are mounting signs that the physical market is recovering. In Europe, key swaps that help price millions of barrels of the world’s oil are trading in a structure that indicates tight supply, while derivatives that contribute to valuing Russian crude are also firming. Those gauges, in tandem with stronger equity markets, have helped buoy crude at times in recent days.“Day-to-day oil trading has become a tussle between bearish oil data, particularly under-powered demand recoveries and record-high inventories, and top-down macro-led expectations of better things to come,” said Standard Chartered analysts including Emily Ashford.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-retreats-china-outbreak-threatening-001428017.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-06-15	2020-06-15 11:45:31	COP	ConocoPhillips	BP Submits to Brutal Reality on the Future of Oil	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- BP Plc’s potential $18 billion writedown underscores just how significant a turning point 2020 is becoming for the oil industry. It baldly acknowledges that the major hydrocarbon producers are sitting on oil fields that will never be developed — because the pandemic has curbed energy demand and increased the desire for renewables within the supply mix.The British oil giant has a new chief executive officer and a new finance director and it was already trying to break with the past before the impact of the Covid-19 crisis became fully apparent. The outbreak has prompted a more radical reassessment of BP’s future role and what its assets are worth.BP’s assumption is that the long-term price of Brent crude will be about $55 per barrel, up to 30% lower than it thought previously. Among its oil major peers, the company’s management is shifting from the bullish to the bearish group. On that basis, some fields won’t earn adequate returns, and some of the world’s fossil fuels that would have been extracted and burnt now won’t be.It’s a moment to be compared not only with peers’ comments of late, but with the seismic revaluations the industry has inflicted on investors over the past two decades — think ConocoPhillips’s $34 billion of asset impairments in the financial crisis.The shift partly reflects the near-term reduction in economic activity. Energy demand is driven by gross domestic product and that’s expected to be sharply lower this year and next. BP also sees the pandemic accelerating the move to cleaner forms of energy as policymakers look to restart economies using less conventional energy, pushing up the cost of emitting carbon.Equities may have recovered from their lows on the expectation that many countries are returning to work. But oil stocks have not, and manufacturers such as Tesla Inc., squarely focused on the transition to cleaner forms of power, have sharply outperformed.Altogether, this hopefully begins to address the economic conundrum that has hampered the energy transition: the relative competitiveness of dirty and clean energy. The higher returns from putting another dollar into the development of conventional energy assets have simply been too tempting for oil majors to allocate serious funds to renewables. It may be some time before the returns BP makes from clean energy can compare with those from oil. Perhaps it can make a virtue of diversification, offering large business clients energy from multiple sources in a way that combines security of supply with an increased proportion of renewable provision.For now, the immediate impact on BP of the writedowns will be to weaken its balance sheet by inflating gearing, which measures net debt as a percentage of total capital. This was 36% at the end of the first quarter (against a long-term target of 20% to 30%). How significant this is will depend on the view of the credit-rating firms. But the pressure to lower leverage will be intense. That, in turn, forces a rethink of BP’s generous dividend.A few weeks ago, CEO Bernard Looney was unapologetic about maintaining the payout amid the pandemic, suggesting the board would wait and see how the crisis developed. The contrast between that message and the hard conclusions aired on Monday couldn’t be more stark.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

Will BP (NYSE:BP) stock see an additional boost? The oil giant's shares have moved higher from their March sell-off lows. Rising from $15.51 per share to $23.62 per share, BP stock got a more than 50% gain in two months.Source: TK Kurikawa / Shutterstock.com Yet, other integrated names have performed even better during this timeframe. Take Chevron (NYSE:CVX), for instance. CVX shares are up about 80% from their 52-week lows. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)? Their shares have doubled since their March lows.So, what's the issue here? More like two issues. With investors anticipating a dividend cut and the company shouldering a massive debt load, there are plenty of reasons for concern.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite these overhangs, today's prices may be a solid entry point for BP stock. Sure, risks remain. However, energy prices continue to bounce back. With the novel coronavirus soon in the rearview mirror, ""return to normal"" will finally happen. With these factors in mind, there's plenty of potential for shares to move higher. Why the Rebound Has Only Just Started For BP StockOil may no longer be trading at negative prices, but it's still substantially lower than where it was just a few months prior. At the start of 2020, crude oil was trading above $60 a barrel. Today? Around $34 a barrel.  * 7 Excellent Penny Stocks Ready to Roar Besides beaten-down prices, things are moving in the right direction. The coronavirus took its toll. With much of the world's economic activity brought to a halt, it's no surprise demand for petroleum collapsed.Yet, with the pandemic slowly ending, expect energy prices to continue bouncing back. Granted, experts like the EIA (Energy Information Administration) don't see prices heading above $50 per barrel until the end of 2021.However, BP is taking active steps to improve its cash flow situation while oil lingers at lower-than-normal prices. By slashing costs, the company expects its breakeven oil price to fall from $56 a barrel in 2019 to just $35 a barrel in 2021.Granted, this implies continued profitability challenges this year. But with Wall Street taking a forward-looking approach, shares could continue to climb in tandem with oil prices, as investors anticipate a rebound in net income and cash flow.In short, shares look appealing as a bottom-fisher's buy. There are some risks to keep in mind before you put in a buy order. Is the Dividend Safe?A dividend cut seems to be the other shoe that's yet to drop. As InvestorPlace's Tom Taulli wrote May 18, the company's current cash flows can't cover the dividend. In short, shares now have a seemingly high yield of 10.7%, but that's only because investors expect a cut sometime soon.Is their validity to these fears? Peers like Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.B, NYSE:RDS.A) have already slashed their dividends. And analysts like Morgan Stanley's Martijn Rats think BP is the next one to announce a cut. He sees the company reducing its dividend by half in order to avoid taking on additional debt.Speaking of debt, that's the other issue at hand with this company. Taulli touched on this in his write-up, stating that the company's outstanding debt continues to climb. Coupled with reduced cash flow, this could mean a serious liquidity situation.Or does it? Based on a market update from back in April, the company detailed their liquidity situation, and their game plan to ride out today's storms. As of March 31, BP had $32 billion in cash and available credit lines.To combat sharp declines in cash flow, the company announced a 25% cut to capital expenditures. They also plan billions in cost-cutting across their upstream (exploration) and downstream (refining/marketing) business units. Pending asset sales could also free up additional capital.The situation at BP is far from perfect, yet these aforementioned risks are likely accounted for in today's valuation. When the other shoes does drop, don't expect shares to fall much further from here. Risks Remain, But BP Could Move HigherThings turn on a dime in the oil patch. Whether it be Middle East conflict, trade wars, or pandemics, it's tough to ""predict the unpredictable"" with energy prices. With today's crisis slowly dissipating, it's fair to assume a bounce back in demand is just around the corner. In short, plenty of reason for oil prices to continue trending higher.Although the company has a lot on its plate regarding debt and an unsustainable dividend, investors have largely priced these risks into the current share price. If and when the dividend gets a haircut, don't expect shares to sell off further.In short, with the potential for shares to rally in tandem with rising oil prices, consider BP stock a buy.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single-stock analysis since 2016.

The practical effects will be played out in the various states, as some stay in lockdown while others move, in a range of ways, to restart the business of living.The results will inform the national debate, whether we’ll see the grim path of a prolonged recession, the rosy case of a V-shaped recovery, or something in between. But a full recovery is for the long-term; closer in, the risks are greater. Writing on the markets for Goldman Sachs, chief US equity strategist David Kostin says, ""Basically, all of the good and optimistic outlook is basically priced into the market today. So where the market’s trading now, I would say the asymmetry of upside [is] perhaps 2%, the downside maybe 15%.”Referring to the risks, Kostin writes, “A single catalyst may not spark a pullback, but a number of concerns and risks exist that we believe… investors are downplaying.” Among the risks Kostin delineates for investors are a possible 15% unemployment rate, companies slashing dividends in the second half of the year, an uneven and dragged-out economic recovery, and the uncertainties of the November Presidential election.So, coming from this background, it’s significant that the stock analysts at Goldman Sacks are finding bullish calls. Using a more selective, risk-averse approach, fitting for their firm’s general stance, they’ve found a series of compelling Buys in today’s markets. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up the details on three of Goldman Sachs’ recent stock picks.Axalta Coating Systems (AXTA)Perhaps best known to casual observers as a major NASCAR sponsor, Axalta is a stalwart of the automotive coatings industry. More than just paint and finishes, high-tech industrial coatings seal and protect the surface of the vehicle. Axalta develops and produces coatings for industrial and refinishing applications, as well as for light and commercial vehicles. The company boasts a market share of $4.94 billion, and a line-up of 10 product brands in six distinct niches.Like many companies, Axalta saw hard times in the first quarter 2020, as EPS declined 8.8% to 31 cents. Looking forward, Wall Street expects to see further declines in Q2, to a net loss of 13 cents. The declines come as the coronavirus economy – with enforced shutdowns – has slowed or stopped both production and sales. AXTA shares have underperformed the broader markets in the current rally, and are still 30% below their late-February peak.While Axalta is in a doldrums now, 5-star analyst Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs is optimistic that the company can bounce back quickly. He cites experience in China, were Axalta’s refinish business is already improving as that country implements economic restarts in hard-hit regions.Koort writes, anticipating the US economic reopening, “…looking forward there is basis for optimism. The company is looking at three key variables: lifting of stay-at-home orders impacting the Reﬁnish business, the pace of Auto OEM production following ramp out of shut-downs, and broad consumer demand. Additionally, Axalta expects Reﬁnish customers to get out in front of the demand recovery following the lift of stay-at-home orders, which could drive a restocking-driven demand surge off of currently low inventory levels.”In line with his upbeat outlook here, Koort has upgraded AXTA stock from Neutral to Buy. His $25 price target implies a 12-month upside potential of 19%. (To watch Koort’s track record, click here)AXTA shares get a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus rating, based on not fewer than 12 Buy ratings outweighing 4 Holds. Shares are priced low at $19.20, while the $22.38 average price target suggests a modest 6.5% premium in the coming year. (See Axalta stock analysis on TipRanks)ConocoPhillips (COP)The first stock on our list of Goldman Sacks recommendations is ConocoPhillips, a giant of the energy industry’s upstream (exploration and production) sector. COP, the world’s largest upstream hydrocarbon company, boasting a $47 billion market cap, finished last year with $7.2 billion in net income, or $6.40 per share.The company beat earnings estimates in a difficult Q1 environment, despite a year-over-year decline. EPS came in at 45 cents, more than double the 21-cent forecast. Revenues were down heavily, at $4.8 billion, and missed the estimates by 26%. In revenues and share price performance, COP has underperformed the markets this year.In a point of great interest to income-minded investors, ConocoPhillips raised its dividend in Q4 and has maintained the new, higher payment. At 42 cents per share quarterly, the dividend annualizes to $1.68 and offers a yield of 4.11%, more than double the average dividend yield found among S&P-listed companies. The payout ratio, at 93%, is high, but indicates that COP’s dividend remains affordable even after the drop in earnings.Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta believes that COP’s current low share price represents a buying opportunity. Mehta writes, “…we believe we are seeing micro/macro fundamentals bottoming and expect ConocoPhillips to be a strong participant in the upcoming oil price upcycle, given the level of underperformance relative to large cap US majors to date, as well as the company’s strong leverage to Brent.”""As investors filter through the Energy sector looking for quality companies on sale, we believe that ConocoPhillips is one that will be able to emerge from the downcycle with its financial position still showing resilience,"" Mehta added.Mehta’s $51 price target supports his Buy rating, and implies a 17% upside to the stock. (To watch Mehta’s track record, click here)In general, the rest of the Street is on the same page. 15 Buy ratings compared to 2 Holds assigned in the last three months give it a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus. However, at the $46 average price target, shares could surge just 6% over the next twelve months. (See ConocoPhillips stock analysis on TipRanks)Canadian Natural (CNQ)Staying with the energy industry, we now take a look at Canadian Natural. This company is the largest landholder in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, major oil- and gas-bearing formation. CNQ is the largest heavy crude oil producer in Canada, and a major player in the natural gas industry. The company has also diversified outside of Canada, and controls several offshore operations in the North Sea and off the West African coast.CNQ reported a 2% increase in total production last year, showing 1.098 billion barrels of oil equivalent for 2019. The company also reported a free cash flow of $4.6 billion, giving a firm foundation going into 2020. That was a fortunate, as Q1 of this year saw a sharp drop in earnings, as CNQ posted its first net loss in 5 quarters. EPS came in at minus 33 cents, a far cry from the expected 4-cent profit.Even though CNQ showed a net loss in Q1, the company maintained its dividend payment. Canadian Natural has a long history of keeping those payments reliable, and also of paying out a high yield. At 7.2%, the stock’s dividend yield is more than double the 3.04% sector average, and more than triple the S&P 500 average. And, it absolutely clobbers US Treasury bonds, which are yielding below 1%.Goldman’s Neil Mehta notes four reasons to Buy this stock, but citing two will suffice to show his bullish stance: “First, as detailed here and here, we have shifted our more negative oil view and defensive Energy equities stance to a more positive/offensive one over the last three weeks. CNQ has strong leverage to an oil and natural gas price recovery that we anticipate. Second, we see sufﬁcient liquidity to make it through the 2020 downcycle and see the company well positioned in 2021-2022 to delever (sic).” To this end, Mehta upgrades the stock to Buy, and his $21 price target indicates his confidence in a 12% upside potential from current levels. With 14 recent review, breaking down to 11 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell, CNQ shares have a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. The stock sells for $18.74, and the $20.49 average price target implies an upside of 9%(See Canadian Natural stock analysis on TipRanks)To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights."	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-3-stocks-double-125642237.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-12	2020-05-12 20:11:36	COP	ConocoPhillips	7 Best Energy Stocks to Ride Out Oil's Recovery	"When it comes to energy stocks, ""safety"" is in the eye of the beholder.The world faces a massive supply glut as the coronavirus pandemic has simply removed much of the world's demand for oil. Energy has become so depressed that, a few weeks ago, the unthinkable happened: crude futures went negative. This means producers were paying contract holders to take crude off their hands.The energy market has normalized since then, and oil has moved higher, but we're still looking at low average prices not seen since the Clinton administration. Prices are still well below breakeven costs for most energy stocks, even some of oil's elder statesmen. Dividends have been cut or suspended. Some - including Whiting Petroleum (WLL) and Diamond Offshore (DOFSQ) - have filed for bankruptcy, and other oil and gas stocks could face the same fate.Thus, few energy investments feel ""safe"" right now. But as is the case after every oil crash, some energy stocks will survive. And of that group, some represent considerable bargains. They might not look pretty at the moment; a few have had to cut back on capital projects, even buybacks and dividends. But these moves have made them likelier to survive this downturn and come back swinging on an upturn in oil prices.Here are seven of the best energy stocks to speculate on as oil tries to claw its way back. It could be a bumpy ride - every one of them could experience more volatility if oil prices swing wildly again. But thanks to smart fiscal management so far in this crisis, they might pan out well for adventurous investors.

ConocoPhillips' move was part of a larger recovery in the broader oil industry, which was hammered in March, first as a price war broke out between Saudi Arabia and Russia, and then as coronavirus-related travel restrictions caused demand for automobile and jet fuel to dry up.  The severity of March's price downturn combined with questions about the severity and duration of coronavirus-related shutdowns caused ConocoPhillips to take drastic action.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/4ca34f20-5788-32df-b565-1e17bf0a4390/why-conocophillips-shares.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-04	2020-05-04 19:26:29	COP	ConocoPhillips	Oil Rallies for Fourth Day as U.S. Crude Build Seen Slowing	(Bloomberg) -- Oil rallied for a fourth day as the pace of stockpile builds at the key U.S. storage hub slowed last week.Futures rose 3.1% in New York Monday, closing above $20, after Genscape reported a 1.8 million-barrel build in inventories in Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for West Texas Intermediate crude. If the U.S. government reports a similar number Wednesday, it would mark the smallest increase at the hub since mid-March.The discount on crude for June delivery relative to July, a structure known as contango, tightened to its narrowest in about a month, indicating that concerns about oversupply may be easing. Last week, crude rallied 60% in three days on early signs of recovering demand and the start of output curbs from OPEC+ and other producers.“It gives a message to the overall market that everyone is leaning in,” Reid Morrison, global energy advisory leader for PwC, said in a phone interview.However, the rebound will likely be a brief reprieve, according to Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA, as the market’s supply overhang eclipses the size of planned productions cuts.“There is a lot of upward momentum in supply that needs to be reversed,” Tchilinguirian said.See also: Oil’s Recovery Could Take Decades, Not Years: Julian LeeOPEC production surged by the most in almost 30 years in April as members waged a price war, and kept supplies high even after reaching a cease-fire in the middle of the month. It will take time to work through that inventory.In the U.S., Texas regulator Ryan Sitton said Monday on Bloomberg TV that an effort to mandate oil production cuts is “dead” a day before the state was set to vote on the measure. Even without quotas, though, explorers are volutarily shutting in massive volumes of oil, with Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., and ConocoPhillips planning to curb as much as 660,000 barrels a day of combined American output by the end of June.“Exactly what the market needs to do is have a price that will force the reduction of production,” Tchilinguirian said. “If the TRC is not going to mandate cuts, it looks like the price will have to do the hard work of bringing about the necessary volume adjustment on the supply side.”See also: Global Oil Demand Starts a Long, Painful and Uncertain RecoveryThe manager of a $500 million oil exchange-traded fund in Hong Kong said its broker refused to let it increase holdings of crude futures. S&P Global Inc., which is behind the most closely followed commodity index, said it will roll West Texas Intermediate futures for July into August, while the United States Oil Fund LP said it will halve holdings in the July contract.The change in behavior among ETFs like the U.S. Oil Fund, while disruptive for traders who sought to pre-empt the routine monthly “roll,” has overall been beneficial for the market, said Olivier Jakob, managing director at consultants Petromatrix GmbH in Zug, Switzerland.“There’s less of an opportunity for some market participants to trade in front of those rolls,” he said. “It’s actually a positive thing -- you have a better perception that the market will trade on fundamentals and not just on what will happen with one big ETF.”View the latest market-moving news and analytics surrounding volatile crude prices from Bloomberg hereFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-falls-ample-supply-investors-223112511.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-05-04	2020-05-04 17:11:05	COP	ConocoPhillips	Texas Oil Quotas ‘Dead,’ Says Regulator Who Touted Them	(Bloomberg) -- A lame-duck Texas regulator who proposed mandatory oil-output cuts said the effort is “dead” a day before the biggest U.S. crude-producing state was set to vote on the measure.Texas Railroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton said in an interview on Bloomberg TV that the three-member agency wasn’t prepared to vote on curtailing supplies in a process known as “pro-rationing.” His comments likely mark the end of a month-and-a-half-long saga that divided the shale industry over whether regulators should adopt OPEC-style production caps amid a historic collapse in crude prices.The unprecedented implosion of the entire oil industry has been so swift and severe that American companies have been turning off drilling rigs, demobilizing fracking crews, slashing jobs and shutting wells without the need for a government order. Fracking activity in U.S. fields has slumped 82% in the past seven weeks, while oil drilling is down 52%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“At this point we still are not ready to act, and so it’s too late, so there is no proposal to make,” Sitton, one of three Republicans on the commission, said Monday. “I think that pro-ration is now dead.”Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips plan to curb as much as 660,000 barrels a day of combined American output by the end of June. Permian Basin producer Concho Resources Inc. has shut in about 4% to 5% of total output and warned last week that it will likely be forced to curtail even more.“The market forces are stronger than the threat of proration ever was,” said Cye Wagner, chairman of the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, which was opposed to state quotas. “It would be more harmful to the industry than the market-driven response that’s coming.”Sitton, who lost the primary election for his own seat earlier this year, had been the only member of the Texas Railroad Commission -- the state’s chief energy regulator -- to come out in favor of production caps. Chairman Wayne Christian recently stated his opposition to cuts in an opinion piece for the Houston Chronicle, and Commissioner Christi Craddick had expressed numerous concerns during the agency’s most recent meeting.Among oil companies, Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and Parsley Energy Inc., founded by a father and his son, had been the biggest champions of instituting mandated cuts.But Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., along with a long list of independent producers, had argued that the market was already driving curtailments and that it was best for the government to stay out of it. The chief executive officer of Enterprise Products Partners LP even went so far as to say that quota-supporting producers were simply trying to skirt contractual obligations.$1,000 PenaltySitton’s proposal called for a 20% cutback in the state’s output, conditional on other states and nations making similar moves. The measure would have penalized producers who exceeded quotas to the tune of $1,000 a barrel. But Christian and Craddick both said they feared legal repercussions that would make such an effort ineffective.“I may be the only lawyer in the group, but I guarantee you this is going to the courthouse,” Craddick said last month.While the debate over production caps may be sidelined in Texas, other states are still considering whether such a response is warranted. Oklahoma is scheduled to discuss quotas on May 11 and North Dakota will take up the issue on May 20. Still, those efforts are likely a long shot without Texas on board.(Updates with Oklahoma, North Dakota meetings in final paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-quotas-oil-output-dead-153540951.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-05-01	2020-05-01 22:18:54	COP	ConocoPhillips	The Great Shale Shut-In Has Begun, Making Good on Trump’s Pledge	(Bloomberg) -- American shale explorers are rapidly crimping production in the country’s most prolific oil fields as the worst price crash in history threatens the industry’s survival.Three of the biggest oil explorers in the U.S. -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., and ConocoPhillips -- plan to curb as much as 660,000 barrels a day of combined American output by the end of June. Across the county, crude production by all companies has already tumbled about 1 million barrels a day since mid-March, when OPEC and its allies clinched an historic deal to trim global supply.It’s too soon to tell how long the reductions will last but if implemented for a full year, they would overshadow any previous American production slide going back to at least 1984. Moreover, the pull-back puts the U.S. on track to fulfill the Trump administration’s pledge to removing 2 million barrels of daily supplies through market attrition.With the new reductions announced just two weeks after crude prices turned negative for the first time on record, resuscitating the market will come at a steep cost for an industry facing bankruptcies, job cuts and consolidation. For some explorers, austerity means slowing growth plans, while for others it means outright subtractions of oil volumes.Almost 40% of oil and natural gas producers face insolvency within the year if crude prices remain near $30 a barrel, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Production shut-ins aren’t just a U.S. phenomenon: wells are being turned off from Scandinavia to Brazil as crude producers wilt under the crash.“You cut out what’s easiest to cut out. Right now that’s the Permian -- you lay down the rigs, walk away and you can always come back to it,” said Mark Stoeckle, a Boston-based fund manager at Adams Funds with $2.1 billion of assets. “It’s very different than other parts of the world” where you have to deal with production sharing agreements, government partners, tougher employment laws.Producers are cutting back more quickly than anyone foresaw as prices sink below break-even levels of even the most efficient explorers. In North Dakota, firms have shut in roughly one-third of the state’s oil production, with more than 40% of that reduction coming from a single company: Continental Resources Inc.In the past seven weeks, more than half of the American rig fleet has gone quiet, with the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico accounting for 56% of the shutdown, according to Baker Hughes Co. data.Supermajors such as Exxon and Chevron -- latecomers to the shale revolution -- are better positioned than most producers to weather the storm, even as their own budgets take a hit.In The GroundWhile Exxon on Friday posted its first loss in at least three decades and Chevron slashed $2 billion off its spending plan, the companies have the capital to taper shale production until prices make a comeback.Exxon, which plans to curb about 100,000 barrels a day of Permian production during the current quarter, will focus on shutting younger, highly productive wells first. In a sense, the company is using the rocks surrounding those untapped wells as de facto storage.Chevron is chopping 125,000 barrels a day from its targeted exit rate for the Permian region this year and idling all but five drilling rigs, Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth told Bloomberg TV. The company is aiming half its worldwide cuts at U.S. fields. The rest will occur as part of its host nations’ OPEC+ commitments, according to Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber.“You can think of the U.S. as choices that we’re making to balance cash flow and long-term value,” Breber said. “Outside the U.S. you can think of it as OPEC+ agreements.”ConocoPhillips plans to cut even more deeply, curtailing worldwide production by 420,000 net barrels a day in June. That equates to about a third of Conoco’s first-quarter output. About 360,000 of those reductions will occur in U.S. fields.Independent Permian shale producer Concho Resources Inc. has already shut in about 4% to 5% of total output, and expects to keep its full-year production for the year around last year’s level. So far, most of the wells that have been shut were higher-cost, vertical wells, but Concho said future curtailments will likely include some horizontal ones -- industry shorthand for shale.While the supply curbs seem to have put a floor under oil prices, with the U.S. benchmark on Friday posting its first weekly gain in in a month, a sustained recovery will rely on even deeper cuts. If prices stay at their current level, hovering around $20 a barrel, shut-ins across the U.S. could reach 2 million barrels a day by June, according to Elisabeth Murphy, an analyst at consultant ESAI Energy.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/great-shale-shut-begun-making-221854464.html?.tsrc=rss

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain is past the peak of the outbreak.Spain recorded steep declines in new cases and Germany is set to extend restrictions. The European Central Bank intensified its response as shutdowns pushed the region’s economy into a record contraction, and President Christine Lagarde gave a dour 2020 projection.FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said the agency is moving at “lightning speed” to review data on Gilead Sciences’ experimental treatment remdesivir. Gilead has more than 50,000 courses of the therapy ready to ship as soon as it’s authorized for emergency use.Key DevelopmentsVirus Tracker: global cases exceed 3.2 million; deaths top 228,000Dueling data on Gilead treatment leaves many questionsDead coronavirus particles muddy outcome of test resultsChina data shows global slump undercut nascent recoveryWorld embraces contact-tracing technology to fight Covid-19Road to easing lockdowns is paved with economic trade-offsSubscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg’s Prognosis team here. Click VRUS on the terminal for news and data on the coronavirus.Medicare Eases Testing Rules (3:23 p.m. NY)People on Medicare will no longer require a doctor’s order to get tested for Covid-19, the Trump administration said Thursday.The move is aimed at expanding testing at “parking lot” sites, according to an announcement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The federal health programs will also cover certain antibody tests to determine whether people have had past exposure to the virus, and approved at-home tests that let people collect samples themselves.With the changes, Medicare beneficiaries should be able to get tested at doctors’ offices or hospitals, at their homes, at pharmacies or drive-through testing sites, the agency said. Medicare covers about 60 million older or disabled Americans.Portugal to Reopen Small Shops (3:15 p.m. NY)Portugal will allow small stores to reopen from Monday, while shops in malls and the largest stores will have to wait until June 1, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said in a presentation of the plan to gradually ease confinement measures during the next month. The government will continue to assess data on the outbreak and if needed “take a step back” in its plan to ease restrictions every two weeks, he said.Gates: Vaccine Possible in 9 Months (3:15 p.m. NY)Bill Gates doesn’t think life will return to normal until there’s a viable vaccine that can stop its spread, and said such work could be completed within nine months.Gates, whose foundation is focusing its efforts on fighting the virus, said in a blog post that he agreed with predictions by infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci that developing a virus could take about 18 months. “It could be as little as nine months or as long as two years,” Gates said.Even at 18 months, that would still be the fastest that scientists have created a new vaccine, Gates said, adding that he’s thinks eight to 10 of the 115 current Covid-19 vaccine candidates look promising.Georgia Seniors Ordered to Stay Home (3 p.m. NY)Georgia Governor Brian Kemp extended his state health emergency through mid-June and urged residents to stay home whenever possible, even as a his shelter-in-place order expires Thursday.Kemp, in a statement, also said he will sign an order requiring “medically fragile and elderly Georgians” to continue to stay at home through June 12. President Donald Trump last week rebuked Kemp, the first governor to ease restrictions, for allowing barber shops, tattoo parlors, bowling alleys and other businesses to reopen.Russian Premier Tests Positive (2:19 p.m. NY)Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said he just learned he has tested positive for coronavirus and is temporarily stepping down, becoming the most senior Russian official to be diagnosed with the illness.“The tests I did for coronavirus came back positive,” Mishustin said in a televised video conversation with President Vladimir Putin. “As a result, I must observe self-isolation and fulfill my doctors’ orders, which is necessary to protect my colleagues.”NYC Subways to Halt Overnight (12:30 p.m. NY)The New York City subway system will stop running for four hours overnight, from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m., for disinfecting of cars and stations, Governor Andrew Cuomo said. The MTA plans to provide transportation during that time with buses, for hire-vehicles and “dollar vans” at no cost to essential workers, the governor said.Read more hereJohnson: U.K. Has Passed Peak (12:20 p.m. NY)Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the U.K. has passed the peak of the coronavirus outbreak, which has now killed more than 26,000 people and forced the country into an ongoing lockdown.In his first press conference since recovering from Covid-19, Johnson promised to set out details next week on how businesses can get back to work to revive the stalled economy.‘Months’ of U.S. Measures: DHS (12:15 p.m. NY)Americans will need to continue social distancing and using cloth face coverings for months, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said. Mitigation measures will be “critically important” beyond next month or the month after, Wolf said during an Auburn University live video event on Thursday.“These measures and procedures will be with us for some time,” he said.Trump Noncommital After N.J. Plea (11:50 a.m. NY)President Donald Trump stopped short of committing to help New Jersey after Democratic Governor Phil Murphy went to the White House Thursday to press for federal aid.Murphy said the state has been crushed by the outbreak and told Trump he would appreciate “consideration” of further aid to states in the next round of coronavirus-related stimulus. Trump complimented Murphy’s leadership but didn’t explicitly commit to providing aid.Pelosi Expects $1 Trillion for Governments (12:10 p.m. NY)House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the next aid package should provide $1 trillion just for states and cities. State governments have so far sought $500 billion, while local governments have a similar figure, Pelosi said. The funding could cover up to four years of expenses, the speaker said, adding that states and localities should be reimbursed both for virus expenses and revenue losses.Pelosi expects the House to return to Washington the week of May 11.Unemployment Strains State Accounts (11:05 a.m. NY)The record number of Americans drawing unemployment benefits during the pandemic is rapidly draining cash set aide by the biggest U.S. states, leaving them poised to borrow from the federal government.In April’s first two weeks, New York drew $1 billion from its account, or more than 40% of the total, according to U.S. Treasury Department data. California’s balance dropped by more than $2 billion since March 16, according to state officials. Texas, which had about $1.3 billion left in mid-April, has submitted a loan request to the Labor Department, as have Illinois, Connecticut and Massachusetts.When accounts run dry, states have to request an advance from the U.S. Labor Department. They have as long as 34 months to repay before the U.S. raises taxes on employers to recoup the money.Florida Cases Rise 1.5% (11 a.m. NY)Florida reported 33,690 cases on Thursday, up 1.5% from a day earlier. Deaths among residents reached 1,268, an increase of 4.1%.New cases rose 2.2% on Tuesday, the highest rate so far this week.Meat Plants Could Reopen in Days: USDA (10:10 a.m. NY)U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue says he expects meat plants to reopen in “days not weeks” under President Donald Trump’s executive order to keep them operating. Perdue anticipates the production shortfall, which he said is about 20% to 30%, to narrow to “10% to 15% within a week to 10 days.”In a telephone interview, Perdue said he expects slaughterhouse workers to immediately begin receiving protective gear and be tested.Macy’s Sets Reopening Schedule (9:55 a.m. NY)Macy’s said it plans to resume operations Monday at 68 locations in Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Oklahoma, where lockdowns are easing.The retailer, which also owns Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury, has added barriers at cash registers, shut most fitting rooms and adopted a no-touch policy in the beauty department. A second set of stores will open May 11, Macy’s confirmed on Thursday, with the intent to reopen all stores by mid-June.FDA Moving at ‘Lightning Speed’ on Gilead Drug: Hahn (9:26 a.m. NY)“We’re working with the company to emphasize the necessity of speed while at the same time to understand the data,” the FDA commissioner said in an interview. “There will be a lot of factors that go into all the regulatory decisions. We want to look at the totality of data to make sure that remdesivir is targeted to the right patients.”Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious-disease expert, said on NBC’s Today Show that he expected an FDA decision relatively soon. A vaccine could be available by January, he said separately.Reliance’s Profit Plummets on Oil Rout (9:23 a.m. NY)Reliance Industries Ltd.’s profit plunged nearly 40% from a year earlier, as lockdowns across the planet slammed demand for fuels, hitting its mainstay refining business.U.K. Bankruptcies Set to Rise After Lockdown Ends (9:16 a.m. NY)Bankruptcy experts say that the number of U.K. insolvencies is likely to rise sharply as further evidence emerged of the damage being inflicted by the lockdown.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, James Slack, told reporters on Thursday that 4.1 billion pounds ($5.1 billion) of government-backed lending has now been issued under the U.K.’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme.Two-thirds of U.K. firms have now applied for funds under the government program that pays 80% of the wages of furloughed workers, according to the Office for National Statistics.Portugal Has Most New Cases in Five Days (9 a.m. NY)Portugal reported the biggest increase in cases in five days, and the number of patients in intensive-care units rose after dropping for 11 days. There were 540 new confirmed infections, taking the total to 25,045, the government said. The number of deaths rose by 16 to 989.Later on Thursday, Portugal is set to announce which businesses can reopen from May 4, with confinement measures to be eased gradually every 15 days. The government hasn’t shut down the economy entirely, with industrial, construction and transport activities allowed to continue.Euro-Area Economy Could Shrink as Much as 12%: Lagarde (8:36 a.m. NY)The economy could shrink from 5% to 12% this year, Lagarde said during the opening statement of the ECB’s virtual monetary policy press conference in Frankfurt.The ECB unveiled a further facility to inject liquidity into the economy after data showed the worst three-month contraction in a quarter of a century of data. It delivered a new lending salvo that includes a so-called “PELTRO” measure to further assist growth, and will keep asset purchases and interest rates unchanged.The bank said the lowest interest rate on a program that gives banks incentives to lend to companies and households will fall to 50 basis points below the deposit rate, currently at -0.5%. Interest on the new, non-targeted facility will be 0.25% below the main refinancing rate that currently is zero.Singapore Cases Must Ease Before Economy Restarts (7:41 a.m. NY)Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong cautioned that things won’t ever get back to the way they were before. He warned “significant structural changes” to the economy are likely even after the virus abates, with some industries disrupted permanently, companies having to change their business models to survive and some jobs simply disappearing. Many workers will have to accept pay cuts so their companies can survive, he said.When Singapore does reopen, it won’t happen all at once, Lee said. Rather, it will reopen step by step, with critical industries and those connected to global supply chains going first. Places that draw crowds, such as entertainment outlets and large-scale sporting events, will have to wait.Germany Sets Out Terms For Lufthansa Aid (7:35 a.m. NY)Deutsche Lufthansa AG is expected to accept a significant government stake and state veto rights in exchange for a multibillion-euro package of assistance, according to people familiar with the matter.While details are still being negotiated, the economy and finance ministries have ironed out disagreements that dragged on for weeks. The plan foresees Germany taking a least a 25% stake in the airline and receiving at least one seat on the firm’s supervisory board, the people said. The assistance could run to 10 billion euros ($11 billion).Children May Be Just as Infectious as Adults (7:30 a.m. NY)Children with the new coronavirus may be as infectious as adults, according to a study from Germany that recommends caution against an unlimited reopening of schools and kindergartens.While children have a lower risk of developing severe illness from Covid-19, they may be no less capable of spreading it. Levels of virus in the respiratory tract -- the main route via which the pathogen is transmitted -- don’t appear significantly different across age groups, Christian Drosten, director of the Institute of Virology at Berlin’s Charite hospital, and colleagues found.The WHO says more research is needed on the topic. For now, household transmission studies indicate that children are less likely to transmit Covid-19 to adults than the reverse, WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove told reporters in Geneva on Wednesday.Conoco Deepens Production Cuts (7:21 a.m. NY)ConocoPhillips estimates that it will voluntarily curtail production by 420,000 net barrels per day. Cuts for May are estimated to be 230,000 barrels per day. Future decisions to curtail will be made on a month-to-month basis.Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, earlier cut its dividend for the first time since at least the Second World War and signaled demand may not fully recover once the pandemic is over.McDonald’s Flags ‘Dramatic’ Changes in Behavior (7:10 a.m. NY)The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted business, the company said. “The resulting operational impact brought on by several related factors, including restaurant closures, limited operations and dramatic changes in consumer behavior, led to a marked decline in sales during the second half of March and significantly affected the company’s first quarter results.”Nissan Sunderland Production Won’t Start Until June (7 a.m. NY)Vehicle Production at Nissan’s U.K. Sunderland plant will continue throughout May, and the company is currently planning a phased resumption of production in early June. Output has been suspended since March 17. The majority of employees at the plant will remain furloughed.That comes as manufacturers from Volkswagen AG to Renault SA and Daimler AG are restarting factories in Europe with little visibility about how much actual demand there will be once customers emerge from restrictions. Aston Martin said last week it intends to reopen its St. Athan factory in Wales on May 5, while operations at its main site in Gaydon, England, “are planned to resume later.”Japan’s Abe Signals Plans to Extend Emergency (6:45 a.m. NY)Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signaled that he plans to extend a national state of emergency, saying that current conditions make it difficult to stick to the current end date of May 6. Abe told reporters in Tokyo it would be difficult to return to the previous way of life on May 7. The country’s parliament passed a $240 billion extra budget for this fiscal year, securing part of the funding for a record stimulus package and clearing a major hurdle for aid getting to small businesses.Separately, Fuji News Network reported that Japan will call for creating a joint fund to combat the pandemic at a teleconference later in the day by Group of Seven finance chiefs. The fund’s main role would be helping make medicines and vaccines against the illness widely available in the world.Continental Shelves Unit Spinoff (6:36 a.m. NY)Continental AG said it’s postponing the planned spinoff of its Vitesco powertrain division due to market disruptions sparked by the coronavirus crisis. Continental won’t put the transaction up for a vote at its July 14 shareholder meeting, but still plans to pursue the spinoff at a later stage. Vitesco makes engine components, electronics and sensors.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gilead-spurs-drug-hopes-florida-224845920.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-28	2020-04-28 12:38:24	COP	ConocoPhillips	What Fracker Earnings Really Need Are Fewer Frackers	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For frackers, this earnings season isn’t really about the earnings, which is just as well: After Covid-19 and the OPEC+ bust-up wrecked expectations in March, April’s negative oil prices rendered the entire quarter irrelevant. Indeed, the sector’s pitch for the entire past decade has been rendered irrelevant. That makes the upcoming round of webcasts a great opportunity to change it.It’s important to remember exploration and production companies entered the current crisis with a serious pre-existing condition. Energy’s weighting in the S&P 500 had been collapsing for years, and the bond market was closing. Those investors who hung on will feel the predictable mixture of fear, frustration and embarrassment. They’ll soon be joined or replaced in some instances by a new cohort: bondholders ending up with equity stakes they didn’t expect. The result, says Dan Pickering, Chief Investment Officer at Pickering Energy Partners Inc., is that “companies will wind up in a more adversarial relationship with owners than they had in the past.” Repairing that relationship, which ought to have been a priority anyway, is now a matter of life or death.Doing so begins with management, and the raft of proxy statements just released aren’t encouraging on that front. Executive pay and shareholder returns still occupy alternate realities. Of 30 companies I sampled, fully 16 awarded above-target bonuses to the CEO despite negative returns to shareholders last year. Another seven got them for returns that, while positive, lagged the S&P 500.In rating their returns against each other, rather than the market, E&P companies keep c-suite pay afloat while their stocks all sink together. Covid-19 makes this circular logic even more damaging. All industries will seek to rebuild after this crisis and compete for scarce capital from burned investors in order to do so. A reputation for benchmarking itself against dross — and with a decade of terrible returns to show for it — will have the E&P industry starting somewhere near the back.More than changes to this or that figure, therefore, E&P companies must communicate a change in attitude. Generalist investors nonplussed by oil and then burned by the Covid-19 crisis will require more than a 12-month budget with some price sensitivities thrown in to tempt them back. The specifics will be different for each firm, but the underlying ethos should be the same: Stop spending money you don’t have on producing energy nobody wants.Throttling back spending not only leaves more money for payouts or cutting debt, it reins in supply. The unprecedented drop in oil demand due to Covid-19 is forcing this, of course. But too many unprofitable barrels were spewing from shale anyway. Kimmeridge Energy Management Co., an activist fund manager, estimates more than 80% of the increase in U.S. oil and gas production in the decade after 2008 was funded with external capital, much of it incinerated in the process. CNX Resources Corp. took a new approach with its earnings call Monday. A year ago, the Appalachian gas producer was touting plans to raise spending and accelerate drilling — and the stock took a beating. This time, it’s all free cash flow twinned with plans for flattish spending and production right through the middle of the decade. Donald Rush, CNX’s finance chief, made the salient point that “if E&P companies are forced to use their own money to fund their own cash needs, [oil and gas] prices will rise to support that.” CNX was the best performing E&P stock Monday, up 12%.Demonstrating commitment to this will take time. Storage tanks are still filling, and Pickering suggests a bottoming process for the sector could take two to five years, not quarters. The objective must be stronger balance sheets and a focus on rewarding investors rather than growth at all costs. This, in turn, would leave E&P firms better able to meet the challenges, and higher risk premiums, of a volatile oil market and intensifying environmental pressure. Capital restraint, meeting the market on its own terms, is the key.Consolidation has an essential role to play in that. No management team will use an earnings call to kick off a sales process. Making it clear they’re open to deals and the board isn’t racing to adopt poison pills would help, though. Fracking is just too fragmented.Surveying 57 E&P companies representing 12.3 million barrels of oil equivalent a day of output, Kimmeridge calculates their SG&A expenses added up to $9.3 billion in 2019. Per barrel, the spread between smaller and larger companies is wide. For example, the biggest, ConocoPhillips, produced more oil and gas than the 28 smallest companies combined. But Conoco spent $556 million on SG&A versus their collective $1.53 billion.Taking the 38 firms producing 250,000 barrels-equivalent a day or less each, SG&A averages $2.93 a barrel. Cutting that to $1.50, on a par with the top five, would save $1.5 billion. If that sounds like pocket change, then you’re forgetting how small these companies are. Set it against their combined market cap of just $18 billion, and it’s an 8% cash yield.Various actors hoping to stave off restructuring with some taxpayer-funded deus ex machina often wrap their self-interest in tropes of energy dominance. But they have it backwards. The U.S. does have a vested interest in a healthy oil and gas sector that doesn’t rely on implicit subsidies such as rampant gas flaring. As Pickering puts it: “Beneath all this is a patient that needs to be saved.” But that means curbing the sector’s worst impulses and prioritizing efficiency.A Soviet-style fetish for sheer oil and gas production will ultimately make the industry a ward of the state and do irreversible damage to our planet in the process. As the earnings calls play out, listen for those companies that accept things can’t just go on as they were, and the ones insisting they must.\-- “Pay Gap” chart by Elaine HeThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2020-04-17	2020-04-17 06:39:52	COP	ConocoPhillips	Oil Anchored Near $20 Set for Weekly Loss on Feeble Demand	(Bloomberg) -- Oil was stuck near $20 a barrel and set for a second weekly loss after a wave of gloomy demand forecasts outweighed optimism that a deal from the world’s biggest producers would alleviate virus-led demand losses.OPEC expects demand for its crude to fall to the lowest in three decades as the coronavirus outbreak freezes the global economy, the group said Thursday. That followed a prediction from the International Energy Agency that 2020 could be the worst year in the history of the oil market. Futures slumped to an 18-year low this week, even after a historic agreement to curb supply.In a joint statement Thursday, Saudi Arabia and Russia said they will “continue to closely monitor the oil market and are prepared to take further measures jointly with OPEC+ and other producers if these are deemed necessary.”Stockpiles across the world continue to expand as consumption of everything from gasoline to jet fuel crashes due to lockdowns to stem the outbreak. The Trump administration is considering paying American companies to leave crude in the ground, while ConocoPhillips is the latest energy major to announce deep cuts to its operations, slashing more than a quarter of its North American production and halting all U.S. fracking.“The latest market response suggests that the output cuts are having limited effect other than to perhaps stall an inevitable moment of reckoning when stocks exceed capacity and tanks overflow,” said John Driscoll, chief strategist for JTD Energy Services Pte in Singapore. “The cuts are not enough.”West Texas Intermediate for May delivery dropped 40 cents, or 2%, to $19.47 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 7:35 a.m. London time. The contract, which expires Tuesday, closed unchanged on Thursday at the lowest level since 2002 and is down almost 15% this week. The more-active June future advanced 3.1% to $26.31.Brent for June delivery rose 2.3% to $28.45 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange after climbing 0.5% on Thursday. The contract is down 9.7% this week.Dated Brent, the benchmark for two-thirds of the world’s physical supply, was assessed at $18.86 on Thursday, compared with $18.08 on Wednesday, according to S&P Global Platts.OPEC estimates that just under 20 million barrels a day will be needed on average from the group during the second quarter, according to its monthly report. The cartel hasn’t pumped this little crude since early 1989. OPEC and its allies have agreed to curb output by 10% starting next month, but even with full compliance, the market is still likely to be oversupplied.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-anchored-near-20-set-021143664.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-16	2020-04-16 19:37:35	COP	ConocoPhillips	Oil Closes Under $20 for Second Day Amid Historic Demand Loss	(Bloomberg) -- Oil closed under $20 a barrel for a second day as projections that demand will fall to a 30-year low outweighed an agreement by the world’s biggest producers to curb supply.Futures in New York ended the day unchanged from the 18-year low set Wednesday. OPEC said it expects demand for its crude to fall to the lowest in three decades as the coronavirus outbreak freezes the global economy, underscoring the urgency of the group’s promised production cuts. OPEC and its allies have agreed to curb output by 10% next month. But even with full compliance, the group would still be pumping more than the market requires in the second quarter.The cuts “certainly aren’t going to be near enough to balance the market,” said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities. “There is a good chance, that over the short run, we might even be lower here.”Inventories from America to Europe and Singapore have all ballooned this week, sending some localized crude prices below $10 a barrel. The glut is looking so severe that the Trump administration is considering paying American companies to leave crude in the ground.The stock builds come as the International Energy Agency said 2020 may be the worst year in the history of the oil market as lockdowns globally lead to the biggest hit to demand ever.“This OPEC deal is great and good but it doesn’t help us over the next thirty days,” Rebecca Babin, senior equity trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management, said by phone. “Even with the OPEC agreement, the size and timing of it is not enough to alleviate potential storage issues in the near term.”All the while physical oil prices, particularly in Europe, are trading far below those of futures. Key North Sea crude swaps are trading at the biggest discount to the headline Brent futures price in almost a decade. The critically important Dated Brent benchmark, which shapes the price of millions of barrels, was assessed by S&P Global Platts at $18.08 on Wednesday, with cargoes across Europe trading at a discount to that value.As real crude prices and futures markets dislocate, some investors are eyeing a bottom in WTI, with almost $700 million flowing into a key ETF so far this week.In response to the market downturn, U.S producer ConocoPhillips said it will cut North American output by more than one-fourth and halt all fracking in the continent.“What will be the most important determinant for oil markets in the short term is how quickly governments relax social distancing measures,” boosting consumption, said Rystad Energy AS’s head of analysis Bjornar Tonhaugen.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-holds-near-18-low-002427704.html?.tsrc=rss

2020-04-16	2020-04-16 18:59:07	COP	ConocoPhillips	ConocoPhillips to Cut Oil Production, Spending Amid Crude Price Collapse	ConocoPhillips (COP) said it plans to cut oil production, reduce capital spending and suspend its share repurchase program as the U.S. oil company copes with the plunge in crude prices.ConocoPhillips will slash gross production by 225,000 barrels of oil per day, cut its operating capital expenditures by an additional $1.6 billion to $4.3 billion. This is in addition to a $700 million reduction announced in March and brings the total cut to about 35% from its original guidance of $6.6 billion. The measures are expected to generate a total of $5 billion in cash savings, the Houston-based company said. Following the announcement, ConocoPhillips shares dropped as much as 5%.“These actions reflect our view that near-term oil prices will remain weak, largely due to demand impacts from COVID-19 and continued oil oversupply,” said Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips chairman and chief executive officer. “We are well-positioned with flexibility to take actions that we believe maintain our relative competitive advantages, as well as our ability to resume programs depending on the timing and path of a recovery.”ConocoPhillips is joining a list of oil and gas producers who have been suffering from weak demand as a result of coronavirus-related lockdowns and as U.S. crude prices have plunged almost 60% this year.Earlier this month, Paul Sankey analyst at Mizuho Securities downgraded ConocoPhillips to Neutral from Buy with a $33 price target, citing doubts about the company driving per share dividend growth when oil markets correct. Sankey, who expects oil volumes to decline over the next three years, added that a major driver of the company's per share dividend growth outlook through the next decade was based on share repurchases.Turning to the remainder of Wall Street analysts, the bulls have it. With 14 Buy ratings and 2 Holds assigned in the last three months, the consensus rating comes in as a Strong Buy. The $50.19 average price target implies 59% upside potential in the coming 12 months. (See ConocoPhillips stock analysis on TipRanks)“We entered this downturn with several competitive advantages, including a very strong balance sheet with over $14 billion of liquidity, a diverse portfolio with low capital intensity, and significant financial and operating flexibility,” said Lance.Related News:  Exxon Mobil Slashes Capital Spending by 30% to Combat Oil Price Collapse    Morgan Stanley Warns on Outlook After 30% Quarterly Profit Drop  Goldman Sachs: 2 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy (And 1 to Avoid) More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is a Great Play, Says 5-Star Analyst   * All Eyes on Apple's Q2 Earnings Next Week   * 3 “Perfect 10&quot; Stocks That Tick All the Boxes   * Vaxart (VXRT) Stock Is a Winner, But How Much Higher Can It Go?	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conocophillips-cut-oil-production-spending-185907205.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-04-16	2020-04-16 15:33:08	COP	ConocoPhillips	Conoco Slashing North American Output in Biggest Oil Cutback	(Bloomberg) -- ConocoPhillips is slashing more than one-fourth of its North American production and halting all U.S. fracking in the continent’s largest pandemic-related oil cutback to date.The dramatic retrenchment in the company’s biggest-producing region accompanies deep spending reductions and a suspension of Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance’s prized share-buyback program. Conoco stock fell 3.2% at 11 a.m. in New York trading on a day when oil futures lingered near an 18-year low.Oil explorers, refiners and shippers around the globe are reeling as the Covid-19 outbreak crushes demand for fuels in a market already saturated with excess supplies. Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp. have also taken steps to conserve cash amid the most severe collapse any living oil executives have ever witnessed.“No one has yet really done what Conoco intends to do,” said Scott Hanold, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets LLC. “We anticipate other industry production curtailments in the coming months.”Lance told analysts and investors that the 2020 guidance provided just four weeks ago no longer applies. Oil and gas output will be scaled back at the Surmont oil-sands complex in Canada and unspecified fields in the lower 48 U.S. states. All fracking in U.S. shale projects also will be halted.In total, the cuts amount to the equivalent of 200,000 barrels of Conoco’s daily output, or 27% of the company’s overall North American production, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. The continent accounted for more than half of Conoco’s worldwide output last year, more than any other region.More ominously, Lance said U.S. capacity to store crude will be exhausted next month and he foresees “a lot more” production curtailments across the industry. Meanwhile, Chief Financial Officer Don Wallette warned during a conference call that the company may make deeper cuts in June. Fracking probably won’t resume before 2021, COO Matt Fox said during the call.Texas CrudeOil prices that were “tolerable” when Conoco first tightened spending last month have mow deteriorated to levels that are “not acceptable,” Wallette said. As the pandemic’s deleterious impact on demand bloats the supply glut, some Texas explorers and related sectors are advocating for state-imposed output cuts, a move that hasn’t been done in the largest U.S. oil-producing state in almost 50 years.On a national level, the Trump administration is considering paying drillers to leave crude in the ground for the duration of the rout.But unlike larger peers like Exxon and Chevron, which are slowing growth rather than making wholesale output reductions, Conoco is going a step farther.“These actions reflect our view that near-term oil prices will remain weak, largely due to demand impacts from Covid-19 and continued oil oversupply,” Lance said in a statement Thursday.Dividend ShieldThe new cuts in capital spending, operating costs and share repurchases add $3 billion beyond the $2.2 billion previously announced. The reductions should help protect the company’s dividend, Hanold said.Conoco’s cuts come about a month after the company first reduced spending and shrank its buyback program.

The oil major said it is making further capital, operating cost and share buyback reductions of $3 billion and suspending its buyback program for now. The company is cutting its 2020 capex budget by another $1.6 billion, reducing it to $4.3 billion, down 35% from its original plan.

Even with recent robust sessions, Chevron stock has lost 36% of its value so far in 2020.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com To some investors, the plunge no doubt looks like an opportunity. Chevron remains one of the world's great energy companies. It's a dividend aristocrat: an 8.4% increase in its dividend in January marked 33 consecutive years in which the company had raised its payout. That dividend now yields an attractive 6.8%.But investors buying Chevron stock on the dip need to keep one thing in mind: the world has changed. Indeed, Chevron itself shows just how much the energy industry has changed.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith an understanding of those changes, the opportunity in CVX stock isn't quite what it appears. The stock should be attractive for energy bulls betting on a rebound. But investors simply looking for a &quot;cheap&quot; quality name likely have better opportunities elsewhere in the market. Security Analyst MeetingOn Mar. 3, Chevron held its Security Analyst Meeting. At the time, energy stocks already were struggling. Soft fourth-quarter earnings from both Chevron and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) dented optimism toward the sector. Chevron stock traded at a four-year low. XOM stock, incredibly, had touched its lowest level in 15 years.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem But Chevron sounded optimistic regardless. The company outlined a plan to return $75 to $80 billion to shareholders over the next five years through dividends and share repurchases. That figure was nearly half Chevron's market capitalization of roughly $175 billion.Adjusted free cash flow was expected to double by 2024, with return on capital employed clearing 10%. To any energy investor looking to buy the dip, the outlook made Chevron stock look exceedingly cheap.Five days later, Saudi Arabia started an &quot;all-out price war&quot; in crude oil. Oil prices plunged. Unsurprisingly, so did Chevron stock, which declined over 15% on the news.By Monday's close, it had declined another 44% from where it closed the day before its analyst meeting. Shares touched a 14-year low. Chevron RespondsWith Brent crude below $30, Chevron's outlook is quite different. Just three weeks after guiding for annual shareholder returns averaging over $15 billion, the company suspended share repurchases altogether. Chevron will keep its dividend -- chief executive officer Michael Wirth told CNBC that the payout &quot;is our number one priority&quot; -- which suggests 2020 returns under $10 billion.Guidance for 2020 capital and exploratory spending is being cut 20%. Production in the Permian basin is coming down by the same amount. Operating costs are being cut as well.Chevron is retrenching. It's going to cut costs, lower production, and look to wait out this cycle.But the impact is severe. It's worth going back to the fourth quarter report on Jan. 31, itself not all that long ago. In its earnings presentation, Chevron noted that a $1 move in the per-barrel price of Brent crude would hit cash flow by roughly $450 million.Brent crude has fallen about $24 per barrel since then. That's a hit to cash flow of over $10 billion. Lower production will only add to the pressure.In 2019, Chevron generated operating cash flow of $27.3 billion. Capital expenditures were $14.1 billion, and still are guided to about $16 billion in 2020.Cut $10 billion off that operating cash flow and free cash flow is almost totally erased. The Decline in Chevron StockLooked at from that perspective, the broader decline in Chevron stock is not an overreaction.To be sure, Chevron still will be profitable in this oil price environment. It's not going to go bankrupt.But Chevron also has a market cap back over $100 billion. The dividend is going to see pressure going forward if oil prices don't recover. Indeed, payouts from Exxon and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are at risk. As Tezcan Gecgil wrote for InvestorPlace this week, the same is true for BP (NYSE:BP). We've already seen a big dividend cut from explorer Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), though its disastrous acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum is to blame.With run-rate free cash flow likely to be relatively thin going forward, Chevron stock actually is pricing in a rebound in oil prices. And, to be fair, it's possible that rebound will come. There is growing skepticism that Saudi Arabia can hold the line in the price war. Russia may give as well.But that doesn't mean Chevron stock is undervalued here. Rather, it's another piece of evidence to suggest that the market's response has been somewhat rational. In a &quot;lower for longer&quot; environment, Chevron's earnings will plunge. So will its free cash flow.That's why Chevron is scrambling to cut costs and lower production just three weeks after it was giving an optimistic five-year outlook. The oil business has changed dramatically. It only makes sense that the Chevron share price would do the same.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-03-24	2020-03-24 14:18:53	COP	ConocoPhillips	Chevron and Conoco Point the Way for Exxon	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The critical element when ripping off a Band-Aid is speed. Chevron Corp.’s cut to its spending budget and suspension of buybacks, announced Tuesday morning, hurts of course. Looked at another way, though, it merely acknowledges the injuries inflicted already. It also leaves a certain large rival whose name rhymes with MexxonObil looking like a laggard again, so that probably helps.No Western oil company’s economics balance at $25-ish a barrel. The market knows this; hence, energy stocks currently vie with the similarly challenged Materials sector for the title of smallest in the S&P 500. Under such circumstances, and with oil demand having dropped into a chasm of pestilence, the prudent thing is to abandon even minimal growth and conserve as much cash as possible without wrecking the business or one’s relationship with investors altogether. Chevron is cutting its capex budget by 20% and, having bought back $1.75 billion of stock in the first quarter, suspending repurchases until further notice.Cutting guidance isn’t pleasant, but given the drop in the stock already, there’s no need to disburse more cash: Even without the buyback, Chevron yields more today on pure dividend than it did on its analyst day. There’s little point funneling more cash to investors if they aren’t valuing it. A similar situation exists for ConocoPhillips, which trimmed capex and cut, but didn’t suspend, its buyback program last week. That leaves one mega-cap U.S. oil and gas producer that is yet to adjust course.Exxon Mobil Corp. had the unfortunate timing of defending its counter-cyclical spending splurge the day before OPEC+ broke up in acrimony and sealed the oil market’s fate. The company has since indicated it is evaluating potentially big cuts to spending, having suffered a credit-rating downgrade from Standard & Poor’s in the meantime. But details are yet to come, and Chevron’s move leaves Exxon looking flat-footed.Exxon now yields more purely on its dividend, but that indicates higher stress. Forecasts for 2020 are in flux to say the least. Still, using Ebitda as a proxy for cash from operations, current consensus figures imply Chevron needing to borrow a little to cover capex and payouts and Conoco covering from cash flow. Both have strong balance sheets. Exxon, on the other hand, has been borrowing or selling assets to cover dividends for a while. And consensus forecasts indicate cash flow won’t cover capex, let alone the roughly $15 billion dividend payout.Despite Tuesday morning’s bounce in oil prices, the market still faces the prospect of storage potentially being maxed out within a couple of months or so — which would precipitate a further crash. It is, therefore, perhaps too early to speculate on which oil stocks offer relative safety and gains on the other side of this crisis. Yet Chevron’s and Conoco’s yields, post spending cuts, look relatively robust. Chevron's stock is up 17% as of writing this. Exxon’s yield may be higher, but the Band-Aid hasn’t come off yet.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2020-03-20	2020-03-20 16:06:30	COP	ConocoPhillips	Diamondback Energy Stock Isn’t Worth Chasing Here	What a difference a month has made for Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) stock. The company had been among the best-performing and best-run shale drillers. But now it is in serious financial trouble: driven massive returns since its 2012 initial public offering, it has since touched an all-time low on Wednesday.Source: Shutterstock The problem for FANG stock, however, is that the selloff actually makes sense. That claim seems bizarre given that the stock has declined 78% in just a month. It's not bizarre in the context of the industry and the balance sheet, however.More simply, it's not bizarre because the world is different for Diamondback than it was just a month ago. This is an industry that has a history of &quot;boom and bust&quot; cycles. The bust has arrived, and it's too early to be forecasting another boom for the stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips FANG Stock Rallies After Q4 2019 ResultsIt's incredible to review Diamondback's fourth quarter 2019 results, released after the close on Feb. 18, with the benefit of hindsight. The quarter was well-received -- shares rallied more than 6% the following day -- and with good reason.Average production rose 5% quarter over quarter, and 50% year over year. Diamondback doubled its dividend to $1.50 annualized, offering (at the time) a 2% yield.  * 10 Stocks to Invest In for a Post-Coronavirus Whipsaw In the release, Diamondback noted that it had raised $3 billion in debt with an investment-grade rating. And it spent another $200 million in the quarter to repurchase stock.In the &quot;old&quot; shale environment, that all was good news. But in the light of an &quot;all out price war&quot; instituted by Saudi Arabia earlier this month, the quarter looks very different. Looking to 2020The ramp in production, for instance, is going to reverse in a hurry. Diamondback has given a &quot;minimum one-month break&quot; for all of its completion crews. The rig count by the end of the year will drop by more than half. Production will steadily decline over the course of the year. Diamondback is trying now to save some of the capital spending it made just months ago.Diamondback has said it will protect its now-doubled dividend, but a cut may be on the way. The $200 million in share repurchases look disastrous: Diamondback paid an average of $82 per share for a stock now traded at $17.The investment-grade balance sheet still holds -- for now. But a cut to &quot;junk&quot; by ratings agencies at this point is just a formality. Diamondback's 5.375% senior notes, due 2025, are priced at 79 cents on the dollar. They yield over 10% to maturity.This simply is a different company. And it's not because Diamondback management was foolish, or dishonest, in February. It's not because investors weren't paying attention. It's because the Saudis moved, and crude oil, at the West Texas Intermediate spot price, went from $53 in February to $31 right now.At that price, much of Diamondback's acreage isn't economical, which is why production is being slashed. Its cash flow is going to plummet, which is why its share price has plunged.To be sure, there are reasonable debates as to whether FANG stock should be at $27 instead of $17 -- or $7 instead of $17. But from a broad standpoint, the decline in FANG stock is not a panic-driven selloff. The outlook is substantially worse than it was a month ago, and so the same should be true of the share price. Yes, Bankruptcy Is a RiskAnd the worst-case scenario is in play. Diamondback generated $3.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in 2019. That figure is going to be slashed going forward. A 40% reduction in prices and much lower production both suggest most of those profits are going to disappear.Yet Diamondback has nearly $5.4 billion in debt. That in turn suggests that debt-to-EBITDA probably clears 6x (at least) looking to 2020 numbers.That's a dangerous multiple. It's actually about in line with where Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) sat last year as its own bankruptcy fears began to accelerate.To be clear, a single multiple doesn't mean Diamondback is going into bankruptcy. It almost certainly won't do so any time soon, given that most of its debt doesn't mature until 2025. The company has plenty of time to respond to the new environment, and to hope for higher prices to return.Still, as long as bonds are yielding 10%, it's important to remember that the worst-case scenario still exists. FANG stock has dropped by 80%, but if everything goes wrong it could fall another 100%. The Case for FANG StockAfter all that gloom and doom, it's important to point out that there is a bull case for FANG stock from here. The fact that crude has plunged doesn't negate the fact that the company has proven to be one of the better-run shale operators out there.In fact, Diamondback sailed nicely through the first shale bust in the middle of the last decade. The drop in WTI to $30 is a different animal, admittedly, but I'd rather bet on oil prices rebounding with FANG than with, say, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), whose stock is reeling from last year's disastrous acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum.But Diamondback needs crude to rally for its stock to rally. As long as WTI stays below $35, I'm skeptical there's enough earnings power to support much more than the current $3 billion market capitalization. And there are other options out there. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Apache (NYSE:APA) both are intriguing plays on a rebound.To be sure, an investor can create a smart thesis for choosing FANG stock as the best play on a rebound in crude. And going forward, there is hope. The balance sheet is in decent shape by sector standards. Management has been solid. Other drillers are going to cut back their own production -- and many will fail. Over time, that may allow for prices to recover.The point, however, is that investors have to build a thesis for Diamondback stock looking forward -- not simply buy because the stock is down so far. After all, many of those investors might have made a similar case at $30, when FANG already was more than 70% off 2019 highs. The stock has fallen since then. Don't forget that it could fall further still.After spending time at a retail brokerage, Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-03-18	2020-03-18 13:26:48	COP	ConocoPhillips	You're Still Buying MLPs? Get a Magnifying Glass	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- With oil crashing below $25 Wednesday morning, the U.S. exploration and production sector is in critical condition already. Beyond the frackers and the majors, though, the double dose of coronavirus and OPEC disintegration is also tearing at the sinews that power it.Oilfield services contractors were still dreaming wistfully of getting back to their pre-2014 health when 2020 rolled around. Halliburton Co., for example, will have to find a new nickname: “Big Red” now has a market cap of about $5.5 billion, down from roughly $50 billion two years ago. Another sector is in danger of vanishing altogether: master limited partnerships.Technically, MLPs aren’t actually a sector; just a particular financing structure that tends to be used for pipelines and other vital logistical bits of the energy business. Regular readers (hey, a man can dream) know I have one or two quibbles with the MLP structure, mainly due to its weak governance resulting in overleveraged companies with insiders and regular investors often at cross purposes — and evaporating unit prices. As investors have given up, particularly on the institutional side, many midstream companies have abandoned the structure altogether, becoming regular C-corps in order to tap a wider pool of money more comfortable with traditional governance and financial metrics.Last September, I totted up the market cap and free float of a sample of 83 North American midstream firms (many of these companies, apart from the C-corps, have a significant sponsor shareholder). Just six months ago, it was striking that the entire sector had a collective market cap of only $575 billion, of which just $484 billion of was actually traded.Golden memories, it turns out. Since then, a few companies have been acquired, so we’re down to 80. Their collective market cap as of Tuesday’s close: $327 billion. To give a sense of how small that is, it is only slightly bigger than the combined market cap of just three large oil producers, Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips — and that’s after their recent, massive sell-offs. The free float of the midstream group is a mere $271 billion. Moreover, C-corps dominate that, accounting for three quarters. You do the math on what that leaves for MLPs.As firms have converted to more-liquid C-corps and the entire sector has dropped, the number of barely-there companies has risen. Six months ago, roughly half the group had an average free float of less than $600 million, already too small for any but the most dedicated money managers to bother with. Today, 58 of the group, or almost three quarters, have an average float of about $400 million.There is a vicious cycle at work here, one which predated the latest crisis but has been amped-up by it. As liquidity in a lot of the sector dries up, so institutional investors are deterred even further, making it worse. At the same time, as bigger companies have converted to C-corps and been withdrawn from MLP indices, so the latter are rebalanced among the remainder — generally smaller companies with weaker performance, making the sector as a whole even less attractive.It has been apparent for a while that the larger remaining MLPs, such as Enterprise Product Partners LP, should convert to C-corps and access a bigger pool of potential investors as their old pool shrinks. For various reasons, usually related to insiders’ control and the tax hit on their low-basis positions in the partnership, some have held out. Yet the collapse in valuations confronts both rationales with a simple question: How much do you really have to lose at this point?Implacable as that is, change is hard. Just on Wednesday morning, Marathon Petroleum Corp. said it had concluded a strategic review of 63%-owned MPLX LP and decided to retain the MLP structure partly on the grounds it “will remain an important, through-cycle source of cash” for the parent. Against that, MPLX currently sports a distribution yield of 29% and has consistently yielded north of 10% since late September, way before coronavirus showed up and OPEC+ imploded.The abrupt shift in oil supply and demand exposes the overbuilding that resulted from midstream’s earlier excesses. That doesn’t mean all assets are suddenly worthless. But the sheer uncertainty about the shape (and scale) of the U.S. energy business that will emerge from this crisis means midstream’s fight for capital, which it was losing already, has become even more desperate. It simply cannot afford to remain chained to a structure whose heyday was more than five years ago and is now evaporating in front of our eyes.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2020-03-13	2020-03-13 15:19:24	COP	ConocoPhillips	7 Drowning Energy Stocks to Avoid for Now	Energy stocks are getting hammered along with the rest of the market, but for a slightly different reason.OPEC met with Russia last weekend, hoping to formalize an agreement to cut crude oil protection and raise prices. As the coronavirus from China spreads, oil prices keep falling, and the outbreak is certain to hurt the global economy.Saudi Arabia had already agreed to drop production to manage reduced demand and keep prices stable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut Russia was having none of it. Not only did it reject the production cuts but said it would pump more to make up for OPEC's reduced supply. Apparently heated words were exchanged by the Russian oil minister and the next in line to the Saudi throne, Mohammad bin Salman.Saudi Arabia then moved to start an all-out price war.Oil prices fell, and then Covid-19 hit the U.S. Major economic activity became restricted to slow its spread. And oil prices dropped even more, as the market fell.These energy stocks are all F-rated in my Portfolio Grader tool that I use to find Growth Investor plays. Avoid these seven companies like Covid-19. Energy Stocks to Sell: Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world's largest integrated oil companies. Usually that's a good thing, since in troubled times it can cut back on say, exploration and production, and continue to focus on downstream marketing and retail sales.But in a situation like this, there is no sector of the business that is doing well. And it's too big to cut back across the board in any meaningful way quickly enough. That's the trouble XOM stock is in now.It's exposed at every level and its global exposure makes it worse, not better. There is no place to turn.XOM stock is off 47% year-to-date. And crude and natural gas prices continue to plummet. The upside is, it has a sizable 8.3% dividend that's pretty safe. But there could be more than that in downside left. BP (BP)Source: TK Kurikawa / Shutterstock.com BP (NYSE:BP) is off 42% in the past month. Remember this is one of the oil giants and has a $90 billion market capitalization. This is not a small company where its stock price rises and falls like the sun.BP, like most of the other integrated oil majors, is in trouble because there's nowhere to turn in this kind of market. And now the global economy is looking shaky.And the fact is, if everyone is avoiding travel, shopping and public school, that directly and indirectly kills its business.Granted the stock is providing a 11.6% dividend now. But this is far too soon to jump in to get that. There's more downside left and that bottom hasn't been found yet. Meanwhile, other stocks have much better prospects due to revolutionary technology. ConocoPhillips (COP)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a major global exploration and production (E&P) company with other integrated operations. It has a good share of natural gas in its portfolio as well.But this is a very demand-based end of the business, and one of the most volatile. When energy prices were steady, it was ideal for COP since it could produce at a stable margin and create efficiencies to maximize those margins.Also, the U.S. economy was expanding, so it could sell into the market and deliver good numbers every quarter.Now, all that has changed. With decreasing demand, its access to and ability to supply energy products is not helping move the needle.The stock is off 56% in the past year, and 52% in the past month. The downside momentum is still very strong. Don't be tempted by its 6% dividend. Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is another global E&P player. It also has some midstream and downstream operations, but its business is pulling energy out of the ground.And that's not a great business right now. As a matter of fact, it's a terrible business right now.The stock is off 82% in the past year and 70% in the past month. And you can be sure, it won't be long until its massive 26.8% dividend gets cut. I'm all for bargain hunting if a company is actually a good buy, but don't bottom fish this thing right now; it's still a falling knife.Carl Icahn announced this week that he is looking to pick up a 10% share of the company here. That may sound encouraging, but unless you have a very long time frame and as much capital to be wrong as Icahn does, your best bet is to avoid this one for a while. PetroChina (PTR)Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com PetroChina (NYSE:PTR) is one of Asia's largest energy companies, but it hardly comes close to its global peers.It's one of two companies that supplies most of China with its energy needs and has created a fast-growing company that is building its global reputation by creating partnerships with larger majors.Yet while its long-term future is bright, given the support of the Chinese government, its short-term fate is a little less certain. First the U.S.-China trade war, and now Covid-19. That's a big one-two punch.The stock is off 50% in the past year and it has just announced that it's going to suspend shipments of liquified natural gas (LNG) imports for at least the next quarter. That was a deal it had with XOM and others. That's not a good sign of the demand in China. Devon Energy (DVN)Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is a decent-sized North American E&P company, with a $2.9 billion market cap.While most energy companies are struggling here, this is a good example of how the upstream sector is being impacted. It's usually the sector that's most leveraged to supply and demand issues with oil and natural gas production. (The select few energy stocks that make my Growth Investor list right now are midstream and downstream companies).DVN stock is off 67% in the past month and 74% in the past 12 months. This is a difficult trend and it's not a place where you should walk in thinking the worst is over.It's possible there may be an overreaction to the potential for a global recession, but it's not worth betting on right now.This is a risky sector that shouldn't be a risky investment, given all the oil and natural gas in the North American shale deposits where DVN works. Steer clear for now. Cimarex Energy (XEC)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Cimarex Energy (NYSE:XEC) is another E&P that's half the size (by market cap) of DVN. Yet its problems are just as big.XEC operates in the Southwest shale regions, including the big daddy of them all, the Permian Basin. But it doesn't matter how much oil and natural gas you can produce if there isn't a market that wants it.Shutting down wells or running them at half capacity is not what E&P companies want to do. But that is what has to be done. Some analysts are betting that this situation is overblown and are stepping in, but they're in the very small minority.The stock is off 62% in the past month and 78% in the past 12 months. This is another one to avoid in one of the hardest-hit sectors in the energy patch.The bottom line, though, is that energy companies are in a terrible position right now. Besides $30 per barrel oil, you have to consider that in the United States the stocks are basically not sold in 33 blue states; they're divesting due to environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investing philosophies.Instead, the companies I'm particularly keen on now are facilitating the spread of ultra-fast internet worldwide -- anywhere there's a cell tower. The 5G Buildout Is an Incredible Opportunity for Investors Right NowWithin two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. With 5G, we'll have cable modem speeds on any device; no need to plug in. That's a big deal for rural areas … the very same areas that are also key to President Donald Trump's reelection. So, by pushing 5G over the goal line, Trump will deliver a big win for his base -- and strike a blow against Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies.But, in the big picture, 5G is about much more than trade wars and faster downloads. Because 5G is 100 times faster than 4G, it'll allow your internet devices to work in real time. That advancement is a game changer for tech companies.With the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity with 5G stocks now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics … but they can't compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it's got ultra-fast 5G. That's how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I'm targeting is enjoying an influx of big money on Wall Street, and it has strong fundamentals, too -- making it an &quot;A&quot;-rated &quot;Strong Buy&quot; in my Portfolio Grader system.Click here to watch my new, free briefing on this extraordinary technology and the opportunity with 5G stocks.When you do, you'll see how to claim a free copy of my new stock report, The Netflix of 5G, which has full details on this company -- and what makes it such a great investment.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett. In one recent feat, Louis discovered the &quot;Master Key&quot; to profiting from the biggest tech revolution of this (or any) generation. Louis Navellier may hold some of the aforementioned securities in one or more of his newsletters.

2020-03-05	2020-03-05 17:17:16	COP	ConocoPhillips	Chevron and Exxon Share Faith in Oil But Pray Differently	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Carbon capture and fuel-spewing algae are interesting, but if Big Oil is going to handle this whole energy-transition thing, the first thing it needs are some new charts.Giving their annual analyst presentations this week, both Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp. kicked things off, more or less, with what can be called the up-and-to-the-right chart. This is a familiar one showing how global oil demand will keep going up for at least a decade or so, and the natural decline of existing fields means there is a huge investment requirement to prevent the pumps running dry. In other words: Hey money managers, read all the Larry Fink letters you like, but you need us.Guys, no. Just stop. Look at where the sector trades. Only last week, I noted how energy’s weighting in the S&P 500 had slipped below utilities for the first time ever. As Exxon made its pitch Thursday morning, and oil prices ignored OPEC’s shock-and-awful supply cut, I wondered if energy could be smaller than real estate by the end of the month.Here’s the thing about the chart: Chevron  and Exxon may well be right that, for one reason or another, oil demand keeps rising through the 2030s. But given the threat of climate change, the growing political and investor focus on it, and the falling cost of rival, zero-carbon energy sources, who now really believes the next decade or two in energy can be defined by a straight(ish) line?Exxon CEO Darren Woods acknowledged the current turmoil, but added “the longer term horizon is clear,” and it’s hard to think of a less-appropriate characterization of the energy business — any bit of it, from fracking to Teslas — in this moment.It’s telling that Exxon’s case for continued growth in consumption of fossil fuels rests on their “affordability,” especially in the developing world. That’s an interesting word, because the whole point of climate change is that we cannot “afford” its potentially catastrophic outcomes (which are expected to hit developing economies harder). If these fuels were “affordable” — in the full, proper sense — then we wouldn’t even be talking about climate change.Ryan Lance, CEO of ConocoPhillips, took a better approach in November when he kicked off with two charts focused on the sector’s denuded relationship with investors and the inherent unpredictability of the market. The gist of that presentation was building an oil and gas company that could weather the storm and bring skeptical investors back.On that basis, those charts aside, Chevron has opened up a clear gap on its strategic positioning versus its rival.It comes down to cash flow and timing. Even as Chevron foresees robust oil demand continuing over the long term, it was careful on Tuesday to leaven that with a heavy dose of near-term rewards for investors, in the form of $75-$80 billion of payouts planned through 2025, equivalent to more than 40% of the current market cap. Assuming $5 billion of annual buybacks and a constant dividend yield of 5.4%, the low end of that guidance implies annual dividend growth of 5%, a payout yield of about 8% and an annual total shareholder return of about 12%. Finance chief Pierre Breber made sure to hammer it home from the stage: “To the generalist portfolio managers out there, if you're looking for cash, Chevron is the place to be.”Exxon, meanwhile, is deep into a counter-cyclical capex boom. And while it eased back on the throttle a tad, it still plans to spend $30-$35 billion a year through 2025. Using Exxon’s guidance of average yearly growth in cash from operations of 10% and the midpoint of the capex range implies Exxon wouldn’t cover its dividend from free cash flow until 2025, even with minimal growth in payouts. Under this scenario, Exxon remains dependent on asset sales or borrowing to bridge the gap. And there appears to be no room for buybacks, once the company’s calling card. As a value proposition, it hews toward multiple expansion rather than cash support.This is why, even as Exxon touted its technological heft and growing earnings capacity on Thursday morning, its dividend yield edged closer to a once-unthinkable 7%. It’s also why the recent flip in relative valuation with Chevron looks set to stay for the foreseeable future.With the Brent crude oil futures curve sub-$58 as far as the eye can see, the $60 price underlying the medium-term scenarios of both companies has raised some eyebrows (although Chevron’s is, notably, nominal). What is clear, though, is that Chevron and Exxon are in very different places right now.Time horizons among energy investors have shortened (see this). Chevron’s balance of spending and cash returns is more attuned to this mindset, which isn’t counter-cyclical so much as anti-cyclical.Exxon, meanwhile, is effectively rebuilding itself; capex guidance through 2025 adds up to roughly three-quarters of its enormous fixed asset base. As Woods said himself in response to a question, when this financial strategy balances is “a function of prices.” Both companies may remain faithful to that straight-line future. The crucial difference is that, from the perspective of today’s investor, Exxon’s approach depends on it.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2020-03-03	2020-03-03 12:30:26	COP	ConocoPhillips	A 10-Year Plan to Save Oil Frackers (From Themselves)	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The oil and gas business could use some hope right now. And who more comforting to provide it than an activist fund? Kimmeridge Energy Management Co., having tangled already with several exploration and production firms, is hunting for a new target. The fund has just released its thoughts on what ails the industry and how to fix it.  Kimmeridge’s diagnosis is inarguable. The shale decade unleashed an unprecedented torrent of U.S. oil and gas; profits, not so much.The root of the problem is that mindset of “peak oil” scarcity which took hold in the early 2000s. The resulting high commodity prices fostered the shale boom. But the hunt for ever more barrels — always a natural instinct in this business anyway — reached pathological levels, abetted by easy financing and c-suite incentives emphasizing quantity over quality. Now scarcity has given way to excess, the carnage in energy portfolios is glaring, and E&P has become all but uninvestable.The key variable here is time.When conventional wisdom held oil was scarce, barrels under the ground were viewed as an appreciating asset, like wealth in a vault (see this). So even if a company’s land-grab generated red ink and the smell of burning cash today, management could point to the horizon and such metrics as net asset value (essentially a modified discounted cash flow figure). Like any such analysis, NAV is only as good as its underlying assumptions. And if your big assumption is that oil demand and prices ultimately only go up and to the right, then why wouldn’t you invest every spare dollar (and then some) in new holes in the ground?It’s now abundantly clear that, rather than running out of oil and gas, we’re running out of our capacity to safely absorb the associated emissions. The frackers’ own innovations boosted supply, deflating oil and gas prices. In that sense, the NAV fetish turns out to be its own cure.What’s needed is a new time horizon, one that’s more here-and-now rather than from-here-to-eternity. Kimmeridge suggests about 10 years; as in, E&P companies commit to pay out the equivalent of their entire valuation over that period. In other words, offer a 10% free cash flow yield. This would shift them away from theoretical, NAV-based value receding ever further down the line to tangible rewards on a more human timescale. This would also address investors’ loss of faith in another sustained oil-price upswing since, after making back their money, they would still own that option.The target would also enforce fiscal discipline — you can’t pay out cash if you spend it all (and bond buyers have walked away). Kimmeridge suggests committing to reinvesting less than 70% of cash from operations (or 80% during better oil-price environments), far lower than the industry’s usual levels(3).Cutting spending necessarily means less drilling and less production — which is good. Continuing to spend money when investors, commodity prices and the obscenity of rampant gas flaring are signaling you to slow down begins to look like a disorder. Lower capital expenditure means less cash put into unprofitable projects, more cash put into shareholders’ pockets and, with lower production growth, support for commodity prices.Overhead also needs cutting. The industry’s fragmentation was a strength as operators competed to innovate and push down costs in shale production. Now it’s more of a millstone, replicating corporate structures and costs across dozens of operators in the same basins. Consolidation would free up cash and, by aggregating landholdings, make it easier to develop promising areas more efficiently and drop the marginal stuff. None of this can happen without fixing broken incentives. A big problem is E&P companies grading themselves versus each other rather than the wider market — a recipe for big executive paychecks despite lousy returns when the whole sector is lagging (see this). You can’t get good results if you reward failure. This chart by analysts at Wolfe Research shows the percentage of target bonus payments earned by 31 E&P CEOs versus total shareholder return in 2018. Notice how 25 of them earned at least 100% of their target bonus — and often much more — despite inflicting losses on investors(2). Note that only ConocoPhillips appears in that top right quadrant. Conoco adopted Kimmeridge’s playbook ahead of time, committing to payouts across the 2020s equivalent to almost 100% of its current market cap. Conoco recognizes growth and oil-price bets aren’t being rewarded; low costs and line of sight on real rewards are.Think about this in the context of the recent IPO of the biggest of Big Oil, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. Saudi Aramco’s great strength is its ginormous oil reserves; a NAV model fantasy. Yet, in order to get a valuation acceptable to the Saudi state, Aramco had to promise bond-like dividend payments for several years and, even then, quarantine the IPO in Riyadh. Foreign institutions wouldn’t just take a flyer on the profferred 4.4% dividend yield or, looked at differently, implied 23-year payout schedule.Time horizons have shortened mostly because of the lessons of the past decade, but also partly because the shadow of climate change looms over the terminal values embedded in oil and gas stocks. Kimmeridge’s brand of activism could help here, too, obliquely.When BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink recently released his letter on climate risk, I noted he should press E&P companies to fix their c-suite incentives. Like the sector’s broken financial model, unbridled carbon (and methane) emissions represent a mindset of constant deferral. This ultimately manifests as excess, involving production and consumption of fuels without proper consideration of their full costs, be they capital or climate.Rationalized E&P investment would also ration emissions. And this needn’t involve oil bosses undergoing some Damascene conversion about climate — just a recognition of shifting risks. Whether oil demand does or doesn’t peak within 10 years, those companies returning most of their value on something like that schedule should be stronger either way. When feeling inundated, the best course of action can be to swim with the tide.— “Performance Unrelated Pay” chart by Elaine He(1) The average reinvestment rate among the 34 members of the S&P 1500 Oil & Gas E&P sub-index masks a wide range in the latest year available, from 55% to 289%. The median rate is 107% (Source: Bloomberg).(2) The S&P 500's total return that year was negative 4.4%, which all of these companies underperformed, apart from ConocoPhillips.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

Oil prices fell to their lowest in more than a year on Monday, as the coronavirus outbreak curtailed Chinese demand and sparked potential supply cuts by OPEC and its allies.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-slow-down-demand-growth-185934555.html?.tsrc=rss
2020-02-04	2020-02-04 17:53:56	COP	ConocoPhillips	Conoco Works to Boost Its Immune System	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The relatively new mantra of value-over-volume in the oil business is facing its first serious popularity contest.ConocoPhillips’s fourth-quarter earnings missed expectations. The company also trimmed production guidance for 2020. At the same time, Conoco boosted its share buyback program by two thirds to $25 billion, with $3 billion due this year, following a 38% dividend increase announced in October.Investors seemed more focused on the former Tuesday morning, with Conoco one of only a few oil stocks in the red. Then again, down roughly 10% since year-end, it is also one of the better-performing oil stocks in what has been a dreadful start to 2020 for the sector. With that in mind, the cash-flow story should get more attention.Conoco laid out a 10-year plan in November best described as embracing the darkness. In place of the bullishness typical of the sector was a long discussion of how to survive in a world where oil stocks aren’t popular and price cycles are fleeting. In short, it now reads like a premonition of the month just gone. Hence, Conoco emphasized paying out more cash to investors and paying its way at lower energy prices.On that front, the latest results offer encouragement. Conoco covered capex, dividends and buybacks from operating cash flow in the fourth quarter. On a full-year basis, free cash flow was positive after dividends and only $532 million in the red after $3.5 billion of buybacks. Most importantly, Conoco managed to roughly balance all this, raising underlying production and shareholder payouts as well as replacing reserves, despite a 9.5% drop in average realized prices for its oil and gas.Underlying this is the reset in cash-flow priorities following early 2016’s dividend cut, shifting away from capex toward payouts.Conoco’s financial strategy doesn’t render it impervious to black swans. Besides the viral ones, there are more prosaic upsets such as the Malaysian pipeline outage that forced the cut in production guidance. Still, if immunity is to be found anywhere in this business these days, it lies in a good balance sheet and prioritizing payouts.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2020-02-04	2020-02-04 16:44:51	COP	ConocoPhillips	Oil Hovers Near $50 as Spreading Virus Imperils Crude Demand	(Bloomberg) -- Oil hovered around the $50-a-barrel mark as the lethal coronavirus paralyzed economic activity for tens of millions of people, prompting some of the world’s biggest crude producers to consider emergency measures.Futures rose 0.7% in New York on Tuesday after earlier dipping to the lowest level in more than a year. The outbreak that originated in China may curb global crude demand growth by as much as 200,000 barrels a day, according to an analysis by OPEC and allied producers.“The market is careful not get too excited, it’s a pull and push between OPEC and the virus,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, Oslo-based chief commodities analyst at SEB AB. “How much OPEC decides to cut production will be a deciding factor for price stabilization.”The virus has already upended trade flows and probably led to a 20% cut in China’s oil demand as cities are quarantined and factories shut. Refineries are curbing operations, while the nation’s top processor is trying to resell millions of barrels of crude it no longer needs. The crisis could wipe out a third of the growth in global consumption this year, said BP Plc finance chief Brian Gilvary.West Texas Intermediate for March delivery rose 41 cents to $50.52 a barrel at 11:13 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price earlier touched $49.66, the lowest since January 2019.Brent for April delivery rose 47 cents to $54.92 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.Despite the recovery in near-term contracts, the oil market’s structure remained under pressure with the closest Brent spread locked in a bearish contango structure.“The movement in the structure in Brent has been traumatic,” said Olivier Jakob, analyst at Petromatrix. “The widening contango is a major sign the market worried about too much supply and it’s gotten OPEC’s attention.”On Tuesday, the OPEC+ Joint Technical Committee was joined by China’s ambassador to international organizations for the meeting in Vienna. A full meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners is currently scheduled for March, but the group is considering whether to hold that gathering earlier.&#92;--With assistance from James Thornhill, Sharon Cho and Alex Longley.To contact the reporters on this story: Alex Longley in London at alongley@bloomberg.net;Grant Smith in London at gsmith52@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Joe Carroll, Mike JeffersFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-extends-losses-below-50-231832891.html?.tsrc=rss

Production excluding Libya fell 1.8% to 1,289 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED). For 2020, the company's operating plan capital guidance is $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion and production outlook is 1,230 MBOED to 1,270 MBOED. The $10 billion addition to the share repurchase program raises the existing program to $25 billion, of which $9.6 billion worth of stock has been purchased since the program's inception in late 2016 through 2019.

2020-01-31	2020-01-31 18:11:43	COP	ConocoPhillips	Exxon Mobil and Chevron Help Fuel Investor Revolt	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- You can’t turn a supertanker quickly, as the old saying goes. Bailing out, on the other hand, takes no time at all.Friday’s double dose of weak Big Oil earnings from Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. followed hard on the heels of Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s debacle on Thursday. Shares of both companies were down about 4%. The market was ahead of them, though: Last Monday, energy’s weighting in the S&P 500 Index slipped below 4% for the first time in at least four decades. Incredibly, that weighting is now less than half a percentage point above that of the utilities sector:My colleague Nathaniel Bullard and I wrote last year about how energy’s dividend yield had recently reversed a decades-long relationship with that of utilities by rising above it. On Friday, the spread widened to a record, with energy’s yield of 4.3% now a full 1.5 percentage points higher than utilities. Short-term factors are at play here, of course; coronavirus, especially, has pushed money toward perceived havens like utilities and away from oil. But that is exacerbating an existing revolt as investors have looked at Big Oil’s track record of managing capital and demanded more of it back.Exxon’s fourth-quarter results stoked that backlash in spades. Performance was weak across the board. Exxon’s integrated model took hits on oil and gas prices in the upstream business and weak margins in both refining and chemicals. Meanwhile, a counter-cyclical investment spree promises great things in areas such as Guyana’s offshore discoveries and improvements in refinery performance, but right now it is a cash sink. Exxon’s cash from operations failed to cover capital expenditures, and it was the fifth quarter in a row in which the company resorted to asset sales or borrowing to cover its dividend.The underlying, and continuing problem, is weak returns. Exxon’s return on equity was notably less than its 5.6% dividend yield —  itself the highest since the merger that formed the company two decades ago; investors have backed away and thereby raised the threshold demanded.Rival Chevron also had a bad morning, albeit better in key respects. Return on equity of 7.5% for the fourth quarter still isn’t where it needs to be, but it was still roughly 2 percentage points higher than Exxon’s. Moreover, Chevron covered its capex and about two-thirds of its dividend payment from cash flow. With this year’s capex budget held flat, the company has more flexibility, raising its dividend by 8.4%. Throw in $5 billion of buybacks, and Chevron’s all-in payout yield for 2020 of 7.2% compares with Exxon’s prospective yield of less than 6%.Exxon’s inability to restart its buyback program, which used to be its calling card, is a big reason its traditional premium has plunged. Exxon’s price-to-book ratio used to be roughly double that of its peers, but the suspension of buybacks in 2016 coincided with a big relative decline in the multiple placed on its book value by investors. Exxon would respond that its buybacks are for excess cash and that it is investing in growth assets to generate future returns. Its problem is that energy investors’ benefit of the doubt is in exceedingly short supply.Even so, Exxon retains a premium that is looking ever harder to defend. It was notable that Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods joined the earnings call Friday. Yet his demurral in response to a question about the price assumptions the company uses for budgeting — referring the analyst to the company’s energy outlook for clues — carried an echo of the old days when Exxon’s solid financial performance allowed it to brush off such requests. Today, with Big Oil’s relative position in the stock market slipping beneath the waves, it feels like a relic of a bygone age. As former supermajor ConocoPhillips demonstrated a couple of months ago, this is a time to over-deliver — not just cash, but information. It’s the only way to keep investors on board.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2020-01-23	2020-01-23 14:59:57	COP	ConocoPhillips	Oil's Contractors Are Contracting, and That's Good	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Kinder Morgan Inc. just issued the thrilling news that it plans to grow profits by 0% this year. That counts as a win in energy in 2020.The pipelines giant was something of a bellwether in late 2015 when it slashed its dividend and soon after did the same to its growth plans. This process reached a logical conclusion of sorts in the full year results presented Wednesday evening. After the usual bullish remarks about natural gas, management outlined a plan to keep spending tight so it could bump the divided up on flat Ebitda. Having chipped away at its debts over the past four years or so, several asset sales allowed leverage to dip a bit further. And even as the project backlog drifted lower, any scurrilous talk of M&A on the earnings call was quashed swiftly.This is your U.S. energy playbook for the foreseeable future, folks.Kinder isn't a bellwether this time; the shrinkage doctrine is cropping up all over. We've just been treated to a set of results from the big oilfield services companies best described as managed retreat. Like Kinder Morgan's gas commentary, Schlumberger Ltd. made its customarily upbeat remarks about the outlook for international drilling activity on its own earnings call last week. Yet the action items are largely a set of retrenchments: job cuts, technology franchising (read: asset-light) and exiting or potentially exiting commoditized businesses such as artificial lift, fracking equipment and drilling tools. Similarly, Halliburton Co. touted growth prospects overseas, while carrying out “initial personnel reductions and real estate rationalization” as its core U.S. land business continues to suffer. Both companies are back to trading at discounts last seen when the oil crash was only just getting underway.The contractors are taking their lead from their clients. Both ConocoPhillips and Chevron Corp. closed out 2019 with declarations of restraint; one via a strategy presentation and the other with a big write-down. Similarly, the shortest run of year-over-year job gains in the U.S. upstream business since 2002 effectively ended in November (see this). It’s tough for even this habitually upbeat industry to talk a big game when (a) natural gas prices are comatose in the middle of JANUARY and (b) despite a year’s worth of Middle East drama having been crammed into just a few weeks, oil futures are lower now than they were after that last supposed game-changer in Saudi Arabia back in September:Evident caution on the part of oil and gas enablers such as pipeline operators and rig contractors is a clear sign the mantra of reducing capital intensity is taking over. After a decade like the one just gone, with many billions wasted in pursuit of sheer market share, that is no bad thing. Plus, with efforts to address climate change — itself essentially a war on waste — this decade brings added pressure to run an extraordinarily tight ship.Old habits die hard, and not everyone gets it. But with E&P earnings season about to kick off, it is worth noting that Kinder Morgan, with guidance roughly as exciting as cocktail hour at a pipelines conference, leads the energy sector on Thursday morning.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2020-01-06	2020-01-06 17:18:24	COP	ConocoPhillips	7 Investing Resolutions to Follow in 2020	The new year and the new decade ahead will give investors a chance to start fresh, or at least an opportunity to commit to investing resolutions. When it comes to stock wins and losses, investors who did not sell the latter group will not have any capital losses to write off. But after the S&P 500 returned close to 30% in the year alone, meaning risks are higher than normal that 2020 will have at least one correction.The reasoning for a small correction is simple: Reversion to the mean is more likely.Investors need not panic about a potential market drop, but they may minimize the damage by following seven basic investing resolutions for 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Investing Resolutions: Pay Attention to ValuationsSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com For fundamental investors, valuations matter in general. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may sport a high price-to-earnings ratio, but that does not mean the stock will correct lower. Microsoft continues to report exceptionally strong software sales and growing cloud business. Subscription growth for Office 365 is unlikely to stall in 2020. So, Microsoft's P/E of over 31 times is easily justified.GameStop (NYSE:GME) trades at just 0.6 times book and has a forward P/E just under 12. The stock is cheap, yet this does not imply the stock is a value holding. Digital game downloads from Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and from Steam are hurting game sales at GameStop.Whatever valuation investors choose, stick to a range that you find suitable and have the discipline to buy and sell. If, for example, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at a forward P/E of over 75 times understates its future growth, then continue holding the stock. Conversely, if you believe Tesla's capital cost requirements will grow so fast that the company will keep losing money, avoid the stock.The bottom line here is that Tesla is an example of a stock that enjoyed a solid rally in the second half of 2019. And if market indexes fall on profit-taking, selling pressure on Tesla may accelerate. Microsoft stock may dip, too, but investors may average down in the stock. That strategy would pay off if the market rebounds and if Microsoft continues to report strong subscription growth throughout 2020. Invest in Out-of-Favor SectorsSource: AVM Images / Shutterstock.com Looking at out-of-favor sectors will pay off if the undervaluation compensates investors for the risks in betting on an eventual recovery. The technology sector was one of many shining areas of the market in the last year. As it rose, markets ignored the rebound in oil prices. Chances are good that the sector will rebound further in 2020.Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A, NYSE:RDS.B) fell as low as $56 in the last few months but promptly rebounded back to $60. With the prospects of energy prices recovering with the support of stronger global growth, RDS is a stock to consider. It pays a dividend that yields over 6%. BP (NYSE:BP) is also trading in a narrow range and pays a dividend that yields 6.5%.The drug manufacturing sector is another beat-up sector that is out of favor. Teva Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:TEVA) is starting to win its investors' confidence. Management is stabilizing the business and applying much of its cash flow to pay down its debt. If the government allows for higher drug prices, Teva's revenue may stop falling. And if generic competition on Teva's Copaxone lessens, the stock could start at $10 as the bottom. Avoid Stocks at the PeaksSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com Avoiding stocks that reached all-time highs in the last year may work if markets really peaked at the end of 2019. If profit-taking picks up at the start of 2020, investors buying Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at all-time highs might face paper losses for a few years. In effect, investors are at the mercy of the markets trending higher. If that does not happen, and if Apple reports weak iPhone 11 sales, its stock may give up its 85% gains.Even though I said Microsoft is a buy based on its relative valuation, the stock also ran up to all-time highs recently. Investors are getting no margin of safety, especially when the stock is widely held in many mutual funds and index exchange-traded funds.Rite Aid's (NYSE:RAD) monstrous run-up to $24 is another example of a stock to avoid at the peak. With a short float of over 25%, a violent squeeze led to the stock's pop after its earnings report. Fundamentals of this drugstore chain improved in the last quarter, surprising short sellers. So, after the drop from the peak, investors may want to consider Rite Aid stock at better levels. A better idea would be to wait for Rite Aid's next earnings report. If it posts improving same-store sales again, then the stock is a compelling investment. Avoid Stocks You Cannot ExplainSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Peter Lynch once said that if you can't explain why you're investing in a company on a postcard, then don't invest in it. The biotechnology sector is fraught with danger for investors who do not understand the difference between drug discovery and drug sales. A drug discovery company has no revenue and applies all of its funded cash to research and development.Dermira (NASDAQ:DERM) is an example of a company that reported positive clinical results for its atopic dermatitis research. Its shares nearly doubled from 52-week lows. XBiotech (NASDAQ:XBIT) also reported positive clinical data in the last few quarters. On Dec. 7, it sold its antibody discovery program to Janssen.Do you have the basic science background to follow clinical studies? Do you see a path to profitability for early-stage drug developers in the biotechnology space? If you do, then find and hold a basket of several drug stocks in this space for diversification.For everyone else, hold drug manufacturing stocks that generate consistently strong cash flow. I picked  Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) throughout 2019 for that reason. AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are examples of stocks that are easier to understand. Of course, with Pfizer and AbbVie at all-time highs, investors might want to wait for a pullback. Avoid FadsSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com In the last decade, buying Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) or Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) would have led to disastrous losses. These companies timed their stock listing at the peak of their respective hype. And when the fad ended, so did the market's euphoria for their stock.For 2020, avoid fad stocks. Stocks that recently went public might happen to be fad stocks, with consumer demand for their products on the decline. Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) stock peaked at $36 in December 2019. Selling accelerated after a viral ad created a mixed but largely negative reaction. But fundamentals for Peloton could deteriorate if discretionary spending weakens in 2020. The Peloton exercise bike is a few thousand dollars and requires a monthly subscription. If owners cancel their service due to a lack of interest, Peloton's revenue growth would plunge.Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) is a potential fad company whose product is facing weakening demand. Still, Hong Kong is an important region for the winter jacket maker. The company forecast weak performance ahead due to the unrest. Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) looked like a fad stock a few years ago but as its highs indicate, that is not true. Lululemon continues to report strong earnings every year. Demand DividendsSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com Technology stocks were star sectors in the last year. Most of the high-flying stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reinvested earnings back in the business or bought back stock. Yet if growth slows, investors end up holding underperforming shares. So, for 2020, investors should focus on holding stocks that pay dividends.Dividend-paying stocks distribute earnings to investors instead of retaining them. This gives investors a stream of regular dividend income. And it becomes a core source of returns should stocks move nowhere or head lower. Disney (NYSE:DIS), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and AbbVie are some dividend-paying stocks to consider. They have an even balance of dividend yield and stock appreciation potential.The energy sector pays a richer dividend yield but due to its cyclical nature, it is riskier. If you happen to believe that the energy cycle is back to its growth phase, then Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are the big mega-capitalization names to look at in 2020. Do Not Judge a Stock for Its AgeSource: Shutterstock Cable companies look stale and are operating in mature-phase markets. Newspapers, magazines and books are declining markets that investors should avoid. Dig deeper into companies that at first look like they are operating in a mature business. Then evaluate their overall growth potential as the business pivots.Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is not just a boring cable company. It has an internet business that is growing nicely, an amusement park and NBC. The company is pivoting its business into the new-age sectors. Very recently, rumors surfaced that Comcast will buy a free streaming service called Xumo. This would fit nicely ahead of its launch of Peacock, a free streaming service.Comcast is dealing with the loss of traditional cable subscribers by looking at it from an NBC perspective. Big affiliate renewal deals will come up in 2021. Plus, Comcast is always looking at its contribution to profits.Even after rising by over 30% in the last year, Comcast trades at a forward P/E of 13.5 times. If its streaming business takes off, markets may reward the stock with a higher valuation.As of this writing, Chris Lau owns shares of BP.

2019-12-27	2019-12-27 12:00:51	COP	ConocoPhillips	Shale's Amazing, World-Changing, Lousy Decade	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In between dealing with margin calls, Aubrey McClendon spent some of 2009 liquidating his famously well-stocked wine cellar in the non-fun way. In vino veritas, as it turns out: McClendon’s vintage version of the financial crisis, after his meteoric rise at the helm of fracking pioneer Chesapeake Energy Corp., embodied the wild successes, excesses and lasting hangover of the shale boom.That same year, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein published a report titled “Will Chesapeake's Board Please Stand Up?”, calling for reform of the company’s almost laughable governance. McClendon eventually stepped down (he died in 2016), and Chesapeake embarked on an effort to clean itself up. While its fortunes have waxed and waned since, they’ve mostly waned. Earlier this month, its sub-$1 stock was threatened with de-listing from the New York Stock Exchange.It is remarkable that, in one big respect, U.S. energy just had its most successful decade ever — and yet turned in the worst performance in the S&P 500 by a wide margin.It isn’t an accident this happened in the same, zero-rate decade that gave us the likes of WeWork. Like many a unicorn, the frackers upended a mature industry using cheap capital in a brash grab for market share. Similarly, profits and payouts to shareholders ranked as distant runners-up to that dash for growth.Chesapeake, for example, didn’t generate a single year of positive free cash flow out of the past 10. During that time, it generated $31 billion in cash from operations and topped that up with $44 billion of disposal proceeds. How much of that $75 billion went on capital expenditure? You guessed it: $75 billion.(1)After a decade of no growth and decent returns on capital, the E&P sector took the opposite approach.Early in the decade, triple-digit oil prices and wide-open equity and junk-bond markets provided a windfall. The E&P sector’s lax governance and perverse incentives ensured much of that ended up either in drilling budgets or sweet compensation packages for insiders. The resulting surplus of oil and gas teed up the crash in late 2014 that is now forcing a reckoning.Ben Dell, the Bernstein analyst who wrote that report on Chesapeake, went on to found Kimmeridge Energy Management Co., a private equity firm that has engaged in shareholder activism with several E&P companies. These campaigns have echoed the central demands in that report from 2009: better governance and financial discipline.In particular, Kimmeridge urges smaller E&P companies to merge in order to cut overheads, direct the savings into shareholder payouts and completely overhaul management compensation, with a heavy emphasis on stock awards linked to absolute total shareholder return.Shifting the priority to returns could not only coax at least some investors back but also cool production growth, thereby taking some of the weight off oil and gas prices. Regarding the latter, Kimmeridge estimates that while the industry’s oil output grew at roughly 10% a year, compounded, in the decade through 2018, the vast majority of that was funded by third-party capital. Purely self-funded growth would have averaged less than 3% a year.It’s an uphill battle, though. Recent campaigns at PDC Energy Inc. and Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. were knocked back — although, given what’s happened since, investors may well regret that. Carrizo, especially, went from shrugging off calls to merge to agreeing to sell itself for a relative pittance within roughly 18 months.Such experiences may be sinking in, though. Generalist investors have largely deserted the sector, with valuation multiples notably unresponsive to oil prices for much of the past year. Equity and debt issuance has dropped off significantly, and stocks of more-indebted frackers have been hit hardest. While the recent rally in oil prices has eased conditions somewhat in the high-yield bond market, option-adjusted spreads for energy issuers remain elevated versus the more-forgiving levels that fueled the pre-2014 boom and offered relief in 2017-18.It is fitting that, as the 2010s draw to a close, the biggest E&P company, ConocoPhillips, hosted a recent analyst day that summed up the fallout from the shale boom and what it will take to navigate from here. Growth must be an output, not an input to the model. Cut capital intensity, not just to fund big payouts but also to smooth volatility and resist the cost inflation that comes from following the herd. Above all, with investors AWOL and concerns about climate change sharpening rapidly, don’t assume energy exposure is a must-have. So benchmark against the market rather than just peers; no one gets rich owning the best performer in a bad sector.Cheap capital, technological breakthroughs and economic recovery should have added up to a vintage decade for frackers. That it didn’t for many is the result of bad decisions fostered by skewed incentives and enabled by weak oversight. In a business with few certainties, it’s a pretty sure thing this just won’t cut it in the 2020s.(1) All these data are for the period 2009-18 (source: Bloomberg).To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2019-12-13	2019-12-13 15:24:56	COP	ConocoPhillips	Even After Its Latest Moves, Chesapeake Energy Stock Is Still Too Risky	Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) stock has become intriguing again. Investors sold CHK off when management raised &quot;going concern&quot; issues. However, recent debt financing deals have bought it more time.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Such a deal may make a recovery in CHK stock possible. However, recent successes in the oil patch have supplied the market with too much oil and gas. Given this reduced pricing, I would not recommend a speculative play in Chesapeake Energy stock.In the last earnings report, the company called into question its future as &quot;going concern.&quot; At that point, I sold my own speculative position, and it has fallen since that time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe problem for CHK stock is that the oil and gas boom has become a victim of its own success. The United States now produces so much oil and gas that these assets continue to lose value.  * These 7 S&P 500 Stocks Will Deliver a Repeat Performance in the Next Decade Chevron (NYSE:CVX) just announced that they would take between $10 billion and $11 billion in write-downs in the fourth quarter as a result. One has to assume that ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and other oil majors could follow suit.The company holds $9.34 billion in long-term debt, a crushing burden for a company with only a $1.5 billion market cap. Falling oil and gas prices and asset write-downs have dimmed the prospects of reducing that debt. Moreover, the move to buy Wildhorse Resources to sell more oil may have backfired as oil prices have also failed to gain traction.That said, the company has again made CHK stock alluring with the latest debt deals. One deal comes in the form of a $1.5 billion, 4.5-year loan facility that retired an existing revolving credit facility worth about $900 million.Under a separate debt agreement, it will issue an additional $1.5 billion in bonds. These will come due in 2025 and carry an 11.5% coupon. They will also finance the retirement of some debts at 62 cents and 70 cents on the dollar.While this appears strange, some of the bonds traded below 50 cents on the dollar, as Dana Blankenhorn pointed out. Hence, these bondholders still benefit. Moreover, these deals buy Chesapeake more time to clean up its balance sheet. All of this has helped take the CHK stock price back up to around 75 cents per share. Chesapeake Energy Stock Has Become a GambleSome stock market detractors refer to investing in equities as &quot;gambling.&quot; In most cases, I object to that view. However, that viewpoint may describe CHK stock accurately. I say this because Josh Enomoto's football analogy describes Chesapeake's situation accurately. Not only must they execute a fourth-and-long play flawlessly, factors which the company does not control must also go right.To be sure, a lot could go wrong for Chesapeake Energy stock. The previously-mentioned asset write-downs do not bode well for the industry. Moreover, the U.S.-China trade dispute makes prospects for selling in China tenuous. The falling cost of renewables could also further dampen the demand for fossil fuels. That push for renewables could accelerate further if a Democrat wins the White House in 2020.Investors who feel they can prevail amid the above conditions may choose to buy. A 100% loss of one's investment is a real possibility. However, if Chesapeake's management has run the right play, and some factors that they do not control go right, the returns on CHK stock could run several multiples above 100%. Still, with the risks involved, this is not a move that I encourage. Concluding Thoughts on Chesapeake Energy StockCHK stock has become a gamble with increasingly longer odds. Falling energy prices and statements from management have cast doubts about the future of Chesapeake.The company inspired some optimism with new debt financing deals. However, conditions continue to worsen as energy prices fail to gain traction. Moreover, geopolitical uncertainties and the increased viability of so-called &quot;clean&quot; energy solutions could add to the revenue pressure.If the company manages to clean up its balance sheet, CHK stock will rise exponentially. However, failure could lead to bankruptcy, and external market conditions continue to bode poorly for the company. Given the worsening market environment, I would not recommend a speculative position here.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-12-11	2019-12-11 16:51:05	COP	ConocoPhillips	Chevron Ushers in Oil’s Era of the Sober-Major	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Along with never invading Russia or getting into a Twitter argument, we can add another golden rule — this one specifically for U.S. oil majors: Never buy a shale-gas business.Chevron Corp.’s $10-11 billion impairment, announced late Tuesday, relates mostly to the Appalachian gas assets it picked up in 2011’s $4.9 billion acquisition of Atlas Energy Inc. Back then, the Permian basin was not a regular topic on the business channels, nor was it a central pillar of Chevron’s spending plans. But now it is, and simultaneously plowing billions into a Permian oil business that spits out gas essentially for free while running a dry-gas business in the Marcellus shale is like flooring it with the parking brake on.Chevron joins the ranks of Exxon Mobil Corp. — which paid $35 billion for XTO Energy Inc. less than a year before the Atlas deal and has been haunted by it ever since — and ConocoPhillips, which bought Rockies gas producer Burlington Resources Inc. way back in 2006 for $36 billion and then wrote most of that off in 2008.But there is far more to this than just mistimed forays into the graveyard of optimism that is the U.S. natural gas market — and not just for Chevron.Big Oil just had a forgettable earnings season. Chevron announced cost overruns on the giant Tengiz expansion project in Kazakhstan. Exxon continued borrowing to cover its dividend. Across the pond, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc flubbed resetting expectations on dividends and buybacks. What ties all of these together are weak returns on capital. Chevron’s problems in Kazakhstan are echoed in its impairment of another asset, the Big Foot field in the Gulf of Mexico. This is another mega-project that went awry and, in an era when producers can no longer count on an oil upswing to save the economics, is found wanting. Chevron is also ditching the Kitimat LNG project in Canada that it bought into in 2013.All this is a particularly sore spot for Chevron given its problems with Australian liquefied natural gas mega-projects earlier this decade. CEO Mike Wirth’s decision to clear the decks seems intended in part to signal that, unlike the experience of his predecessor with Australian LNG development, he will drop big assets that don’t make the cut financially.Discovering, financing and developing mega-projects is why the supermajors were created at the end of the 1990s. Today, when investors are interested at all, they’re leery of capital outlays, aware the outlook for oil and gas markets is challenged in fundamental ways. So tying up money in big, risky, multi-year ventures is a good way to crush your stock price.Wirth isn’t abandoning conventional development; Big Foot aside, the Gulf Of Mexico has several new projects in the pipeline, for example. But to offset the drag on returns from the extra spending at Tengiz, he must streamline the rest of the portfolio. This is the story of the sector writ large. “Too much capital is chasing too few opportunities,” as Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI puts it. Conoco, which remade itself radically after the Burlington debacle, set the tone with its recent analyst day, emphasizing the need to get the industry’s long-standing spending habits under control and focus on returns to win back investors who are free to put their money into other sectors. Chevron’s write-offs and shareholder payouts (38% of cash from operations over the past 12 months) are of a piece with this. While the company has laid out guidance for production to grow by 3% to 4% a year, that is very much subject to the returns on offer. Capital intensity — as in, shrinking it — is what counts.Chevron’s move throws the spotlight especially on big rival Exxon. While Exxon has taken some impairment against its U.S. gas assets, that represented a small fraction of the XTO purchase. Exxon also sticks out right now for its giant capex budget (bigger than Chevron’s by more than half), leaving no room for buybacks or even to fully cover its dividend.In the first decade of the supermajors, when peak oil supply was a thing, big projects with big budgets to match were something to boast about. As the second decade draws to an end, only the leanest operators will survive. Chevron won’t be the last oil major to rip off the band-aid, just as we haven’t yet seen the full extent of the inevitable restructurings and consolidation among the smaller E&P companies. On this front, there’s another golden rule: Better to get it done sooner rather than later. To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2019-12-10	2019-12-10 16:47:09	COP	ConocoPhillips	The 10 Best Energy Stocks to Buy for 2020	As the bull market sails past its first decade, value-minded investors worry that there are few bargains left. But there are, if you're willing to wade into the oil patch. The big problem is finding the courage. Even some of the best energy stocks have suffered recent returns reminiscent of the Deepwater Horizon.Oil-focused stocks naturally are subject to the price of oil, which depends, in part, on Middle East politics, the global economy and U.S. driving habits. Oil prices (as well as natural gas and other energy sources) also depend on supply, and oil has been plentiful, thanks to the revolution in fracking.Over the past 12 months, West Texas intermediate crude oil has seen its price fall to about $57 from $74 a year earlier. This is particularly bad for energy stocks that explore and drill for oil, known as upstream companies. For companies that refine oil into gasoline and other products, however, lower prices can be good, since oil is a cost to them, rather than a product.Will the energy sector find relief in 2020? So far, the experts aren't hopeful. The International Agency Energy says that oil supplies could be rich once again thanks to a pickup in production and tepid growth in demand. That bodes poorly for prices.If you're still willing to brave a potentially difficult sector, however, here are 10 of the best energy stocks to buy for 2020.

The latest indications were that the group agreed to adjust official production targets but it remains to be seen if that will result in real reductions despite prospects for a global oversupply.“It’s OPEC day and there is a sense of cautious optimism in the air,” PVM Oil Associates analyst Stephen Brennock wrote in a report. “There is a consensus among market players that the oil cartel will deepen supply curbs in order to avert a supply imbalance in the new year.”A key committee convened by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia recommended cutting overall output quotas by 500,000 barrels a day during the first quarter, according to Russian Oil Minister Alexander Novak said. However, the committee didn’t discuss how the reduction would be distributed among member nations, he said.West Texas Intermediate for January delivery rose 46 cents to $58.89 a barrel at 11:41 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier breaching $59 for the first time in 2 1/2 months. For the week, the contract was poised for its steepest gain since June.Brent for February settlement advanced 45 cents to $63.45 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a $4.90 premium to WTI for the same month.To contact the reporters on this story: Sheela Tobben in New York at vtobben@bloomberg.net;Alex Longley in London at alongley@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Joe Carroll, Carlos CaminadaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-holds-surge-stockpiles-add-080256341.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-29	2019-11-29 03:24:06	COP	ConocoPhillips	As U.S. Majors Cool on Australia, Japan’s Inpex Sees Opportunity	(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s largest petroleum exploration company, Inpex Corp., is looking at expanding its natural gas business in Australia, even as U.S. energy majors Exxon Mobil Corp. and ConocoPhillips scale back their operations in the country.Both Exxon and Conoco are selling non-core assets to boost shareholder returns and fund more attractive growth elsewhere around the world. Inpex sees it differently, looking to snap up assets to feed its $45 billion Ichthys liquefied natural gas project off northwest Australia, which is just one year into its expected 40-year lifespan.“There are so many opportunities here in Australia,” said Hitoshi Okawa, head of Inpex’s Australia business, after the company earlier this month announced its 100th shipment from the project. “We’re here for the long haul.”Exxon said in September that it was seeking a buyer for maturing gas fields off southeast Australia, while Conoco last month announced a $1.4 billion deal to sell its LNG business in northern Australia to local company Santos Ltd. With Ichthys now in normal production, Okawa is turning his attention to finding fresh reserves to keep the huge project running at full capacity of 8.9 million tons a year.The Cash Maple field, owned by Thailand’s PTT Exploration & Production Pcl, and the Crux prospect are two options among several Okawa is considering because of their proximity to the Ichthys Field, which is connected via an 890-kilometer (550-mile) pipeline to the LNG plant near Darwin.PTTEP said in September it was seeking a partner for Cash Maple, while Inpex already cooperates with Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Crux’s majority owner, through a minority stake in Prelude LNG, the world’s largest offshore facility.Australia is preparing for what it hopes will be a second wave of LNG investment after local firms and global majors spent more than $200 billion over the past decade building enough plants to make the country the world’s leader in export capacity. That effort was led by U.S. major Chevron Corp.’s $88 billion Wheatstone and Gorgon LNG projects, the latter of which Exxon owns 25% in.Another question for Okawa is whether to double down on the separate Darwin LNG processing facility, soon to be operated by Santos after Conoco opted to sell its share. Inpex already holds an 11.4% stake in Darwin and Santos Managing Director Kevin Gallagher has said he would like partner “alignment” in the Barossa gas field, which Santos has earmarked to supply the Darwin plant.“That’s Kevin’s aspiration, he’s a good friend of mine” Okawa said, “Of course we think about the importance of alignment but a commercial decision is required.”Okawa also said he saw potential for collaboration between Ichthys and Darwin LNG. For now, he is keeping his options open as his company seeks to deepen its ties to the country.“We want to be an employer of choice, a partner of choice and a company that is indispensable to Australia’s economic development,” Okawa said. “Without having the proper awareness in the community and within government, it’s very difficult for us to expand the business here in Australia.”To contact the reporter on this story: James Thornhill in Sydney at jthornhill3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Rob Verdonck, Dan MurtaughFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-majors-cool-australia-japan-032406277.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-22	2019-11-22 14:00:28	COP	ConocoPhillips	Shale's Haves and Have-Nots Fight for Fuel	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Diamondback Energy Inc.’s stock air-dropped earlier this month after the company shocked investors with disappointing earnings and production problems. It doesn’t help that oil prices have been in the doldrums since June and 2020 looks dicey. So it can hardly be surprising that, in its latest sale of 10-year debt, Diamondback was forced to pay up with a yield of … 3.55%.Those bond vigilantes are merciless.OPEC may regard America’s frackers as its nemesis, but the true enemy of the oil exporters’ club has been U.S. capital markets (see this). The latter’s willingness to adopt a venture-like role of financing an enormous, and largely loss-making, grab for market share in global oil and gas has been the critical force of the past 10 years. The tumult of that decade in energy markets suggests we can hardly expect the next one to be placid. So Diamondback’s ability to secure funding through 2029 at a spread to Treasuries of less than 2% seems like further confirmation that OPEC’s real arch-enemy remains as defiant as Monty Python’s Black Knight.The Black Knight is showing some signs of fatigue, however.The energy high-yield bond market has tightened severely again; at 785 basis points, the option-adjusted spread to Treasuries is at its widest in more than three years (before the initial supply cuts from OPEC+). Likewise, on the equity side, the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF is trading close to its lowest level since it launched in 2006. Haynes and Boone LLP, which tracks bankruptcies in the sector, noted in its latest report that the pace had picked up this year, with the majority of filings happening since May.That Diamondback was able to issue $3 billion of new bonds at very attractive rates anyway gets at something going on beneath the headline collapse in sentiment. Namely, the gap between haves and have-nots when it comes to leverage in the shale patch appears to be widening. Diamondback is a high-yield issuer; but, rated Ba1 by Moody’s Corp., it is scraping investment grade (and has recently been upgraded to investment grade by Standard & Poor's). With net debt of 1.8 times Ebitda, its leverage isn’t low but also isn’t high by the standards of the sector. I ran a screen of 42 E&P companies with a market cap greater than $500 million each and segmented them into four groups based on leverage. After removing one very large constituent from each group for weighting purposes, I ran equity indices based on the groups, as charted below(1):The gap between the four groups really opens up in May, coinciding with oil rolling over after a spring rally. While leverage may have changed for each of the companies over time, the relative performance over the past year fits with the longer picture.Despite markedly different performances, the broad sell-off in E&P stocks has compressed average valuation multiples for the groups into a narrow range. Crucially, however, the spread between those multiples and reported leverage tells the story of where the vast majority of the equity value in E&P has migrated:The leverage gap between E&P companies, and the growing disparity in their access to capital, should curb the anticipated growth in U.S. oil production in 2020. It also suggests conditions for consolidation in shale-land — largely elusive until now — are ripening. That said, given the market’s reaction to acquisitions so far, valuations will likely need to drop lower before larger companies with better balance sheets take the plunge (ConocoPhillips’s  recent analyst day certainly suggests so).Looking at all this, you might expect that when OPEC members gather in two weeks’ time, they could conclude it’s best to hold off and let this all play out. The only problem? Most of them aren’t in great shape either.Updated to add Diamondback’s S&P credit-rating upgrade.(1) The four groups are: as follows. Very high leverage (net debt &gt;3x Ebitda) comprising Antero Resources, Chesapeake Energy, Comstock Resources, EQT, Laredo Petroleum, Noble Energy, Oasis Petroleum, Range Resources. High leverage (2-3 x Ebitda) comprising Apache, Callon Petroleum, Carrizo Oil & Gas, CNX Resources, Matador Resources, QEP Resources, Southwestern Energy. Moderate leverage (1-2x Ebitda) comprising Berry Petroleum, Centennial Resource Development, Cimarex Energy, Continental Resources, Diamondback Energy, Diversified Oil & Gas, Jagged Peak Energy, Marathon Oil, Murphy Oil, Northern Oil and Gas, Parsley Energy, PDC Energy, SM Energy, SRC Energy, Talos Energy, W&T Offshore, WPX Energy.

2019-11-19	2019-11-19 20:10:31	COP	ConocoPhillips	Oil Falls Most in Seven Weeks Amid Supply Rise, Trade Impasse	(Bloomberg) -- Oil dropped the most in seven weeks as American crude stockpiles are forecast to rise and U.S.-China trade talks stall.Futures fell 3.2% in New York, the biggest decline since Sept. 30. U.S. oil inventories probably rose by 1.5 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey ahead of a government report on Wednesday. Markets are also being pressured by the impasse in trade discussions between the U.S. and China. While Russia is unlikely to agree to deepen output cuts, it could extend existing curbs to support Saudi Arabia, Reuters reported.“We are going into this week with another storage build expected in the EIA’s report,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. “The trade deal has soured and the vibe on the deal has turned a bit negative and that will affect demand too.”The ebb and flow of trade talks between Washington and Beijing has weighed on oil prices, which have fallen more than 15% from an April peak. The report that Russia isn’t considering deeper cuts follows news of other large producers in OPEC+ who aren’t pushing for deeper oil-supply cuts either, according to delegates across the coalition.“The market push down was already vulnerable,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “Russia is playing hardball going into an OPEC meeting, but they always do.”West Texas Intermediate for December delivery fell $1.84 to settle at $55.21 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The front-month contract will expire on Wednesday.Brent for January settlement slipped $1.53 to end the session at $60.91 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a $5.56 premium to WTI for the same month.U.S. crude stockpiles are at the highest level in four months. If official government data confirms the forecast in inventories on Wednesday, it would be the fourth straight weekly advance.&#92;--With assistance from Kriti Gupta.To contact the reporter on this story: Jacquelyn Melinek in New York at jmelinek@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Catherine Traywick, Mike JeffersFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-extends-drop-second-day-030528867.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-11-19	2019-11-19 19:31:39	COP	ConocoPhillips	Conoco Plans Share Buyback That’s Almost 50% of Market Value	(Bloomberg) -- ConocoPhillips announced a 10-year plan to buy back $30 billion of shares, equivalent to about half of its current market capitalization, as the oil producer attempts to distance itself from the troubled U.S. shale industry.The company also said it will pay dividends of about $20 billion over the period and limit average capital expenditure to about 10% above current levels.Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance told investors and analysts at a presentation in Houston on Tuesday that the long-term plan sets the company apart from its peers amid a fight to regain the interest of shareholders in U.S. oil and gas, one of the worst-performing sectors this year.“The industry faces a flight of sponsorship by investors,” Lance said during the presentation. There’s a “struggle for relevance unless the industry can create value on sustained basis.”After being forced into a painful dividend cut during the 2014-2016 oil price crash, the third-largest U.S. oil producer has regrouped under Lance and has built a reputation of being one of the more dependable producers, differentiating itself from other shale operators that have disappointed on production and earnings.Energy stocks have shrunk to less than 5% of the S&P 500 Index, less than half the level a decade ago, after shale producers burned through nearly $200 billion of cash in pursuit of surging flows of oil and gas. Oil and gas producers have responded by returning more cash to shareholders. At the end of their most recent full fiscal years, U.S. energy companies in the S&P 500 bought back $24.2 billion of shares, compared with $10.5 billion in the previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.With investors focused on returns rather than output expansion, Conoco is busy morphing into a low-growth but high cash-generating company that’s built to withstand low crude prices and peak oil demand, which the International Energy Agency says could happen around 2030.Conoco’s plan “shows sustainability over a long period” and a business model “that can deliver competitive returns and appeal to a wide range of investors,” Scott Hanold, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets LLC, said in a note.Conoco was 0.8% higher at $57.15 at 2:27 p.m. in New York trading. The stock has dropped 8.3% this year, while the Standard and Poor’s 500 Energy Index has advanced 1.3%.Investors have delivered stinging rebukes to energy companies this year for paying substantial premiums for acquisitions, such as Occidental Petroleum Corp.’s $37 billion deal for Anadarko Petroleum Corp. Chief Operating Officer Matt Fox admitted that the “elephant in the room” is the possibility Conoco will use its cash hoard for a major deal.“Obviously we can’t and we shouldn’t rule that out, but we can rule out doing a bad acquisition driven by the wrong reasons,” Fox said during the presentation. “We’re not going to do something that undermines our financial framework.”What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“With leverage below 1x cash flow, Conoco has plenty of room to make opportunistic acquisitions. The Permian Basin is likely the biggest target, with significant assets in the area and a relatively small presence in Conoco’s portfolio. However, overdrilling by some of its neighbors will drive management to be highly selective of deals.”&#92;--Brett Gibbs, BI analystRead the research here.Conoco also has conventional production in Alaska, Europe and Asia, while also operating in shale basins. Though Conoco aims to avoid the pitfalls of rival shale producers, the sector will provide much of the company’s growth and account for about 60% of its capital expenditure over the next decade. Its shale production from the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Montney in Canada will more than double to 900,000 barrels a day by 2029.Conoco said it will stick with about 20 drill rigs and won’t try to chase higher production in times of high crude prices, which tends to destroy shareholder capital, Fox said.“Unfortunately, we know this because we did it,” he said.(Updates with industry buybacks in sixth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Brad Skillman.To contact the reporter on this story: Kevin Crowley in Houston at kcrowley1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net, Christine BuurmaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conoco-plans-share-buyback-equal-165029086.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-11-19	2019-11-19 18:38:15	COP	ConocoPhillips	Conoco's 2020s Plan Is to Embrace the FUD	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- ConocoPhillips knows how to please a crowd, even one as shrunken and beaten-down as energy investors. By Tuesday lunchtime, as Conoco’s analyst day was wrapping up in Houston, it was the only big U.S. oil and gas stock flashing green, what with oil prices slipping almost 3%.This says a lot about why Conoco’s message resonates: It comes with a hefty dollop of FUD.“Fear, uncertainty, doubt” is what bears thrive on, but Conoco has refined it into something useful. CEO Ryan Lance set the tone with an opening slide called “Two Charts We Can’t Ignore,” showing how oil had dropped from its pre-2015 triple-digit level to the “new normal of lower, more volatile prices” and how the sector’s weighting in the S&P 500 had slumped from 12% in 2012 to today’s 4%. The subtitle of that slide could have been “but Lord knows the industry has tried to ignore them anyway,” which is how it ended up at that 4% weighting.Hence, Conoco continues to beat a different drum. The common thread running through Tuesday’s 152 slides is that oil and gas production is a mature business with a bad track record on capital management and a future clouded by climate change. There is no room for banking on higher commodity prices, and investors have given up paying for the oil option in E&P equities anyway.So forget exuberance and focus on resilience. Conoco’s message can be boiled down to cutting its breakeven cost per barrel and returning a lot of cash to shareholders. It plans on generating $12 billion a year of cash from operations, on average, through the 2020s, of which 60% goes to capital expenditure and 40% to buybacks and dividends. The latter equate to about 80% of the current market cap and are split themselves 60/40 in favor of buybacks, reflecting the reality of the cycle.Conoco bases its math on a $50 real oil price and expects production would grow by roughly a third over the next decade — or, factoring in the buybacks, significantly more than doubling on a per-share basis. Altogether, a projected average return made up of 8% free cash flow yield plus 3% growth is tailor-made for today’s energy investor, in contrast to the old, failed paradigm of a 10%-plus return owing everything to growth and nothing to payouts. Needless to say, Conoco was at pains to emphasize its cautious view on potential acquisitions, fear of which has weighed on the stock this year as fracker valuations have collapsed.None of this makes Conoco immune to oil’s vicissitudes, of course. Free cash flow tilts toward the back end of the decade, and the company would effectively borrow to fund some of its buybacks through 2025, at $50 oil. That said, having cut net debt by two-thirds since the end of 2016, Conoco doesn’t envisage leverage rising to even one times Ebitda in 2025. Under a stress-test scenario, where oil prices average $40 a barrel between 2023-25, the company doesn’t see leverage breaching two times Ebitda.Let’s just step back here in 2019 and acknowledge that, looking back at everything that’s unfolded in oil over the past decade, any 10-year projection should be treated less like a Google map and more like asking someone on the street for directions. Indeed, for me, the most important slide in Conoco’s deck looked back rather than forward(1). Here, COO Matt Fox talked through lessons learned from prior investment programs, chief of which is to stop committing the industry’s original sin: pro-cyclicality. In other words, don’t base your spending on how much spending power you have at any given moment. Rather, by targeting low breakeven costs, which factor in wherever the industry happens to be in the cycle, you smooth out investment and minimize spending when cost inflation is high and bringing on new production just as commodity prices turn down.This spend high/sell low approach pretty much sums up what the industry did over the past 10 years, vaporizing capital in the process. The chart below uses the U.S. onshore rig count as a proxy for industry capex, and you can see how it surged in the early years on the back of high oil prices, with much of the subsequent growth in production arriving after prices crashed. Even though frackers made real gains in efficiency in that time, the performance of the sector ETF tells you what this did to returns:This is especially important in the context of the new mantra being preached by many E&P companies today: namely, that they will live within their means. Conoco’s message is that just ensuring you don’t spend more than you make in a given year isn’t the cure for the sector’s ills. Rather, it’s about smoothing spending, production — and thereby payouts — over time in order to escape the boom and bust cycle. It is the latter that has eroded confidence in the industry’s earnings and, hence, led to lower and lower multiples being put on those earnings.Fear and doubt will always attach to oil prices, but companies can do something about uncertainty.(1) Slide 32 if you download the deck.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2019-11-08	2019-11-08 17:55:55	COP	ConocoPhillips	3 “Perfect 10” Energy Stocks to Power Returns	Has the energy sector been reinvigorated? Judging by the XLE Energy ETF’s 6% rally over the last month, some investors think that this might just be the case.That being said, the Street’s experienced pros remind investors that not all of the names in the space are clear winners. Given the industry’s resurgence, what’s the best way to scope out the energy stocks poised to outperform?Upon first glance, it can be tempting to only look at a single factor like fundamentals to try and gauge the strength of an investment. However, this is just one piece of the puzzle. To see the bigger picture, we turned to TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy tool.The tool helped us zero in on 3 energy stocks that have earned a “Perfect 10” Smart Score, a single number that combines 8 metrics measured by TipRanks’ algorithm, with 10 being the highest. This score is generated by weighing hedge fund activity, analyst consensus and price targets, insider trades, as well as several other key factors.ConocoPhillips (COP)Despite seeing its shares struggle year-to-date, the largest independent crude producer in the U.S. is staging a noteworthy turnaround.According to the oil company’s Q3 earnings release, COP has a lot to brag about. While some had originally expressed concerns regarding the impact of lower crude prices and increased exploration costs, the company was able to post an earnings beat. Quarterly profits surpassed the consensus estimate thanks to strong shale production as well as asset sales gains.Total production, before factoring in its Libyan assets, increased by 98,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) and U.S. shale basin output gained 21% in the quarter. The shale regions include Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Permian Basins.The company has also made a significant effort to divest from assets in the U.K., with this move generating $2.2 billion.Nonetheless, Mizuho analyst Paul Sankey’s key takeaway from COP’s earnings results is its ability to remain a high dividend payer. With the company upping the quarterly payout by 38%, the analyst believes that COP is “uniquely positioned to deliver on it right now.&quot;Taking this into consideration, Sankey maintains his bullish approach. Additionally, his $80 price target indicates 39% upside potential. (To watch Sankey’s track record, click here)Similarly, the rest of the Street likes what it’s seeing. With 6 Buy recommendations and 1 Hold issued in the last three months, COP is a ‘Strong Buy.' Share prices could also surge 27% based on the $75 average price target. (See ConocoPhillips stock analysis on TipRanks) Matador Resources (MTDR)Matador Resources is an independent energy company focusing on oil and natural gas exploration in the Delaware Basin as well as the Eagle Ford, Cotton Valley and Haynesville shale plays. With shares climbing 8% higher following a solid third quarter performance, it’s easy to see why MTDR is on the Street’s radar.The company reported on October 30 that average daily oil equivalent production reached an all-time quarterly high. We’re talking 69,600 boe/d or a 14% sequential increase. This accomplishment comes as a result of strong initial performance from certain wells in the Antelope Ridge and Rustler Breaks regions as well as the completion of several new wells. If that wasn’t promising enough, average daily natural gas production also broke MTDR’s record.Not to mention MTDR is right on track to meet its free cash flow targets thanks to its operations, E&P and midstream segments, according to Stephens analyst Gail Nicholson. He adds that Matador is a compelling investment due to its exposure to the Delaware Basin and “compelling rate of change story.”All of the above factors prompted Nicholson to give the company a ratings boost. Along with the upgrade, his $24 price target conveys his confidence in MTDR’s ability to soar 60% over the next twelve months. (To watch Nicholson’s track record, click here)In general, other Wall Street analysts are optimistic when it comes to MTDR. The stock has a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus due to the 5 Buy ratings and 1 Hold it racked up over the last three months. Its $24 average price target implies upside potential of 58%. (See Matador Resources stock analysis on TipRanks)Callon Petroleum (CPE)Callon Petroleum specializes in the exploration and development of sites in the Permian Basin. Coming on the heels of its third quarter earnings release, several Wall Street analysts think a recovery is on the horizon.Even though CPE has struggled year-to-date, its efforts in its most recent quarter to drive a turnaround haven’t gone unnoticed by investors. Overall production came in at 37.8 Mboe/d, up 8% year-over-year. In addition, the company saw an operating margin of $35.58 per Boe.It doesn’t hurt that CPE was able to cut operational capital spending by 13%, with this figure landing at $116.4 million. This allowed it to maintain full year capital targets even though management had originally lowered the guidance range.“Our successful mega-pad development projects are not only generating significant and durable cost savings but have exhibited solid productivity. In addition, the continued efforts to optimize previously acquired assets have resulted in incremental value to shareholders as our team has made noteworthy progress on well productivity and operational costs across our expanded asset base,” CEO Joe Gatto stated.These developments have led Citigroup analyst Brian Downey to believe that CPE looks like a long-term winner. Despite reducing the price target from $10 to $8.50, he still sees a potential twelve month gain of 101%. (To watch Downey’s track record, click here)Looking at the consensus breakdown, Wall Street takes a bullish stance on CPE. 6 Buys and 1 Hold issued over the previous three months make the stock a ‘Strong Buy.' It should also be noted that its $7.14 average stock-price forecast suggests 61% upside from the current share price.

2019-10-29	2019-10-29 18:28:47	COP	ConocoPhillips	Conoco Ramps Up Cash to Be Antithesis of Shale Sector	(Bloomberg) -- ConocoPhillips posted higher-than-expected third-quarter earnings as the world’s largest independent oil producer generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow despite lower crude prices.The Houston-based company followed BP Plc on Tuesday in surpassing analysts’ projections, partly due to its U.S. shale production, which rose 21% from a year earlier. The stock rose as much as 4.1% in New York with Brent crude up 0.4%.Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance is preparing to unveil a 10-year strategic plan to investors next month. Conoco, which was forced into a painful dividend cut during the 2014-2016 oil price crash, is trying to position itself as a steady cash generator, the antithesis of the struggling U.S. shale industry, by focusing on returns to investors over production growth.“This quarter extends our successful track record of performance since we reset our value proposition in 2016,” Lance said in a statement.Profit excluding one-time items was 82 cents a share, higher than all of the analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg, its eighth earnings beat in nine quarters. That shows the company can keep generating “robust” free cash flow, analysts at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. said in a note.Conoco gets a high proportion of its oil from assets in Alaska, Asia and the Middle East that have production that’s declining relatively slowly. But it’s also focused on growing its shale output, especially in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin, albeit at a slower pace than pure-play rivals. Unconventional production rose 21% to 379,000 barrels a day compared with a year earlier.Despite that, overall production missed estimates by a small margin. Output in the quarter was 1.32 million barrels per day of oil equivalent, less than the median estimate of 1.34 million. Production should decline in the current quarter due to the sale of U.K. assets and output limits in Qatar, Chief Operating Officer Matt Fox said on a call.The shares rose 3.6% to $57.69 at 2:09 p.m. in New York. The stock was the best performer in the S&P 500 Energy Index last year but has lagged behind the gauge so far this year.Conoco’s cash was boosted by about $100 million from Venezuela’s state-owned producer, part of a long-running legal settlement after the state nationalized its assets more than a decade ago.(Updates with share price in second, penultimate paragraphs)To contact the reporter on this story: Kevin Crowley in Houston at kcrowley1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net, Joe Carroll, Carlos CaminadaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conocophillips-profit-beats-estimates-shale-111512098.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-22	2019-10-22 21:32:58	COP	ConocoPhillips	Oil Companies Rejected by Supreme Court on Climate Change Suits	(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court let government officials press ahead with three lawsuits that accuse more than a dozen oil and gas companies of contributing to climate change.Without comment or published dissent, the high court Tuesday refused to block a lawsuit by Baltimore while companies try to shift it from Maryland state court into federal court, where businesses tend to fare better. Individual justices then rejected similar requests in cases from Rhode Island and Colorado.The suits are among about a dozen similar cases filed by state and local governments around the country against the fossil-fuel industry.The companies defending against the two lawsuits include BP Plc, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil Corp., Phillips 66 and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. The companies told the Supreme Court in the Baltimore case they would be subject to “duplicative and unrecoverable” litigation costs if the cases went forward.Government officials say they are already suffering from storms, flooding, increasing heat and growing emergency response costs as a result of climate change.Justice Samuel Alito didn’t take part in the Baltimore case. Although he gave no reasons, Alito owns stock in ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66, according to his most recent financial disclosure report.The cases are BP Plc, v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 19A368; BP v. Rhode Island, 19A391; and Suncor v.

2019-10-14	2019-10-14 14:42:21	COP	ConocoPhillips	3 ‘Perfect 10’ Stocks That Could Win Big	US-China trade talks resumed on Thursday, and on Friday President Trump announced a preliminary agreement outlining Phase I of a potential trade deal. The outline includes ramped-up Chinese purchase of US agricultural products and US cancellation of new tariffs planned for October 15. The news made an immediate impact on the markets, with the Dow Jones jumping 320 points on by Friday’s close, and the S&P 500 adding a 1.1% gain of 32 points.So, markets are looking up after two volatile weeks, and investors want to know the best places to put their money. TipRanks has the guide you need to find the right stocks to buy, in the Smart Score tool. The Smart Score uses a multi-factor analysis to rate every stock in the market, taking data from insider opinions, hedge fund activity, news sentiment, and technical and fundamental analyses. The result is distilled to a single number on a rising scale of 1 to 10, making it simple and intuitive to use.Using the Smart Score filters, we’ve picked out three stocks with perfect 10 scores and Buy ratings that are ready to rise with today’s markets.PagSeguro Digital (PAGS)For investors in the US markets, Brazil’s banking industry may not be the first sector that comes to mind when considering profits. PagSeguro, however, is not a typical component of the banking industry. It’s an online e-commerce payment service, catering to commercial clients primarily among Brazil’s banks, but also internationally. It’s a successful niche; PagSeguro’s stock is up an eye-catching 143% year-to-date.Taking a close look at the Smart Score, we see that the technical factors are positive.  PAGS’s return on equity is a healthy 17.67%. Hedge fund activity on this stock is rising, with the major funds increasing their holdings by more than 330,000 shares in the last quarter. Finally, the financial bloggers are bullish on PAGS, with the positive sentiment at 80%, well above the sector average of 65%.The stock’s market performance and future potential have gained the notice of Wall Street’s analysts. Writing from JPMorgan, Domingos Falavina notes the company’s drive to expand services beyond the core niche of Brazilian banks to international commercial clients, saying, “PagSeguro disclosed its banking initiative already has 1.4mn clients. Some of those clients are micro merchants and existed preceding the retail initiative launched mid-May; others however are new net adds from May launch. We estimate consumer retail clients will reach ~3mn by YE 2020 and we attribute an economic value to them of~$1k/client.”He sums up his stance on PAGS by saying, “PagSeguro will leverage on strong brand value to now successfully deliver a banking solution to the long tail of retail customers.” In line with his upbeat outlook on the stock, Falavina raised his price target by 50%, from $40 to $60. His new price target suggests an upside potential of about 30% to PAGS stock. (To watch Falavina'a track record, click here)Moving on to Deutsche Bank’s Bryan Keane who met the company’s CEO Ricardo Dutra da Silva at an industry conference in Las Vegas. After speaking with the CEO, Keane wrote, “Since going public and despite the increase in competitors, Mr. Dutra’s belief that micro-merchants are not price sensitive to merchant discount rates (MDRs) has been confirmed… Highlighting the health of the business, we believe net merchant adds are running ahead of plan and that guidance for ~1m in FY19 will ultimately prove conservative.” He sees a bullish future for PAGS, and sets a $57 price target, describing the company’s strategy as &quot;winning.&quot;Overall, the two most recent analyst reviews on PAGS are Buy ratings, making the stock an overall Moderate Buy on TipRanks. Shares are trading for $45.68, and have an average price target of $58.50, making the upside potential a healthy 28%. (See PagSeguro stock analysis on TipRanks)Arista Networks (ANET)Arista is a mid-cap networking company out of Silicon Valley. Arista produces multilayer network switches and software-defined networking in the cloud computing and datacenter sectors. The company’s products are found in the high-performance computing and high-frequency trading environments, and run on a company-designed Linux-based operating system.The high-end networking niche brought Arista $328 million in profit last year, on more than $2.15 billion in revenues. Better yet, Arista has beaten quarterly earnings expectations in every report for the last two years. In the most recent report, for Q2 released, the company’s $2.20 EPS beat the forecast by 11%.The Smart Score reflects this underlying strength. Return on equity is up 34.33%, and the asset growth is up 21.51%. More importantly, the sentiment on this stock is bullish News sentiment, which measures the stock’s standing in journalistic coverage, is 100% bullish, while the bloggers sentiment comes in at 91%.A profitable niche in the computer networking industry, and a history of beating the earnings forecasts, have earned ANET accolades from some of the Street’s top analysts. 5-star Cowen analyst Paul Silverstein gave this stock a $295 price target after attending investor meetings with the company CFO. In support of his high price target, Silverstein wrote, “Arista should continue to benefit from an ongoing data center upgrade. Arista’s high-performance EOS has proved to be a significant competitive differentiator, delivering ease, speed and agility of application and service provisioning. Arista also enjoys a management team that has a demonstrated ability to open doors and close deals.”James Fish, a 4-star analyst with Piper Jaffray, reiterated his Buy rating on ANET last week. In his previous comments on the stock, he pointed out, “Arista is furthest along in the contribution of software to its business relative to peers, and the updates likely create further adoption… Arista has only penetrated ~10% of its installed base with CloudVision, leaving a large opportunity ahead… We believe Arista remains best-in-class for datacenter switching.” Fish’s $272 target indicates a potential for 15% upside to ANET.Overall, this stock has a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus. This is based on 12 ratings given in the last three months, including 7 &quot;buys&quot; and 5 &quot;holds.&quot; Shares are selling for $236, and the average price target of $279 implies room for an 19% upside. (See Arista stock analysis on TipRanks)ConocoPhillips (COP)With our third ‘perfect 10’ stock, we enter the energy market. ConocoPhillips is an old name in the oil industry, and stands as the largest exploration and production company in the petroleum sector. COP showed 2018 revenue of $38.727 billion, and generated net profits of $6.257 billion. The company beat earnings expectations in 3 of the last 4 quarters. Impressively, COP has managed this despite crude oil prices dropping over the past six months.Turning to the Smart Score, COP shows some impressive stats. Blogger opinion is 88% bullish, and news sentiment is 100% bullish. In the fundamentals, the 12-month return on equity is 22.28%, and the asset growth is 3.37%. The most impressive mark, however, comes from the hedge fund activity; the major funds purchased over 4 million shares of COP in the second quarter of 2019.For income-minded investors, COP offers a newly increased dividend and a commitment to boosting share value. The company this month announced a 38% increase to the dividend, making the quarterly payment 42 cents per share and bumping the annual yield to 3.1%. For comparison, the average dividend yield on the S$P 500 is 2%. Despite the drop in oil prices, COP has $12 billion in liquid assets to back up the announced $3 billion in share buybacks for 2020.UBS analyst Lloyd Byrne is impressed with COP’s performance. He reiterated his Buy rating, saying, “We think COP is taking the right steps to attract the generalist: a stable business model with visibility that focuses on returns on capital, and returning excess cash flow to the shareholder… COP holds their investor day on Nov 19th and is expected to detail a 10-year outlook including a more detailed capital plan… We expect a plan that provides details into asset specific trajectories including Eagle Ford, Bakken, Delaware, international (Montney?) and Alaska assets.” In line with this optimistic outlook, Byrne put a $75 price target on the stock, suggesting an upside potential of 33%.Overall, COP holds a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, with 5 &quot;buys&quot; and 1 &quot;hold&quot; ratings given in the past three months. Shares sell for $56.43 and have an average price target of $74, giving the stock room for about 30% upside.

2019-10-14	2019-10-14 05:58:30	COP	ConocoPhillips	Santos Targets Asia LNG Growth With $1.4 Billion Conoco Deal	(Bloomberg) -- Santos Ltd. agreed to buy ConocoPhillips’ northern Australia business for $1.4 billion in a deal that will boost the Adelaide-based oil and gas producer’s position in the growing Asian liquefied natural gas market.The transaction may allow Santos to become the country’s largest independent energy producer and capitalize on a push by Asian consumers, including China, to switch to cleaner burning natural gas away from coal. Conoco is selling its operating interests in the Darwin LNG processing plant and the Bayu-Undan, Barossa and Poseidon gas fields.“The acquisition of these assets fully aligns with Santos’ growth strategy to build on existing infrastructure positions, while advancing our aim to be a leading regional LNG supplier,” Santos Chief Executive Officer Kevin Gallagher said in a statement.Santos has been expanding its position in the Australian oil and gas market having acquired Quadrant Energy for about $2.15 billion in 2018. Its latest deal could help it become Australia’s top independent energy producer: Santos and Conoco’s northern Australia assets produced about 94 million barrels of oil equivalent last year, compared to Woodside Petroleum Ltd.’s 91.4 million.Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts said Conoco’s northern Australia business has a net asset value of about $1.8 billion, citing Rystad Energy AS. The deal has “compelling strategic merit,” RBC energy analyst Ben Wilson said in a note to clients, adding that the price looked reasonable based on RBC’s valuation of the assets at around $1.63 billion.Santos, which posted its biggest share gain this year, said it would fund the acquisition from existing cash and $750 million in new two-year debt. Conoco will receive a further $75 million once Barossa enters final investment decision.Conoco is the second U.S. energy major to announce plans to sell down its interests in Australia after Exxon Mobil Corp. in September said it would start a process to find a buyer for its Bass Strait producing assets off the coast of southeast Australia. Conoco completed the sale of its stake in the Greater Sunrise field to Timor-Leste’s government for $350 million earlier this year, and the Santos deal will free up capital to invest in U.S. shale and return cash to shareholders, two of its priorities in recent years.Conoco is also operator of the Australia Pacific LNG export facility in Queensland, which is not part of the Santos deal.Advanced TalksSantos plans to sell 25% of Conoco’s interest in the Darwin LNG export plant to South Korean firm SK E&S as part of the agreement. The company is also in talks with the facility’s joint venture partners, which include Inpex Corp, Tokyo Gas Co. Ltd., Jera Co. and Italy’s Eni SpA, to sell equity in the Barossa field, which has been earmarked to back-fill the Darwin plant once Bayu-Undan reserves run dry around the end of 2022. Santos will target ownership stakes in both the assets of 40%-50%.“What we’re seeking is alignment,” said Gallagher on a media call. “What we’re looking for is people to be balanced on both sides of the joint venture,” he added, referring to partners having stakes in both Darwin LNG and Barossa.Gallagher said the company is in advanced discussions with LNG buyers for gas off-take from Barossa, including with an existing partner in Darwin LNG, and was looking to contract 60%-80% of gas volumes for the project prior to taking a FID, which is expected in early 2020.As an upstream, brownfield project, Barossa was “low risk” compared to new greenfield LNG projects around the world, “and because of that it’s got a very competitive cost of supply,” said Gallagher. Its location close to Asian markets also meant that shipping costs were less than from other competing projects. “It’s got very robust economics, even in this soft market that we find ourselves in today.”Santos has ambitious plans to grow DLNG capacity by up to 10 million tons per annum, compared to 3.7 mtpa currently. Over the longer term, the potentially huge onshore gas shale reserves in the Beetaloo and McArthur Basins could be processed through DLNG, Gallagher said.Santos’s shares ended 5.7% higher in Sydney trading Monday, having risen as much as 7.7% at one point.Following the SK sell-down, Santos’ holding in Darwin LNG is expected to be 43.4%, with SK at 25%, Inpex at 11.4%, Eni at 11%, Jera at 6.1% and Tokyo Gas at 3.1%. Santos will hold 62.5% in Barossa, with SK owning the remaining 37.5%.(Updates share price in sixth and penultimate paragraphs)&#92;--With assistance from Dan Murtaugh.To contact the reporter on this story: James Thornhill in Sydney at jthornhill3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Aaron Clark, Jasmine NgFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conoco-sells-north-australia-assets-221307166.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-10-13	2019-10-13 06:00:05	COP	ConocoPhillips	America’s Great Shale Oil Boom Is Nearly Over	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- America’s second shale boom is running out of steam. But don’t panic just yet, a third one may be coming over the horizon.The U.S. Energy Information Administration published its latest short-term energy outlook last week and has cut its forecast of oil production by the end of 2020 for the fourth straight month. It now expects American output to rise by just 370,000 barrels a day over the course of next year. That will be the slowest growth in four years and is yet another indicator that the latest period of rapid shale expansion is faltering.The number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. has fallen in each of the last 10 months, dropping by a total of 20% since November. And productivity gains are waning. Drilling in the Permian, the most prolific of the shale basins, fell by 11% in the nine months to August, according to the EIA.The development of the U.S. shale patch is a bit like that of a person. During the first growth spurt in the four years to 2014 the industry was in the toddler phase. Everything was new and exciting, the toddlers stuck their fingers (or in this case their drill bits) into everything, just to see what would happen, and they pushed the boundaries in every direction. The toddler developed quickly, but the outside world taught it a hard lesson with a crash in the oil price in 2014.The second boom from 2016 has been more like the adolescent phase. After picking themselves up and learning to live in their changed world, the young adults developed their muscles and concentrated only on the things that interested them (the sweet spots in the shale deposits) to the exclusion of everything else. This focus has brought bigger output gains than the first boom. In the three years between December 2016 and December 2019 output is expected to have increased by 4.2 million barrels a day, compared with 3.9 million barrels a day between December 2010 and December 2014.The biggest challenges of the second shale boom have been identifying and exploiting those sweet spots, consolidating acreage to enable the use of longer wells, and building infrastructure to move the gas and liquids to markets (including overseas).But with a WTI oil price of about $50 a barrel, some in the shale patch are struggling. Shale companies are being forced to produce more to service their high debts, but they aren’t making any surplus profit to cut their borrowing or pay shareholders. Now those investors are starting to demand more of a return.With the crude price seemingly stuck close to where it is — despite the tensions in the Persian Gulf region which flared up again on Friday —  the next round of discussions between the shale producers and their lenders could be difficult. Some mergers may follow.Yet fans of U.S. oil shouldn’t be disconsolate. The end of the second shale boom will usher in a third: the period of young adulthood. This will bring a range of new skills, but production will grow at a more measured pace.This third boom will be driven by the international oil majors and will be characterized by a focus on better extraction, rather than rapid output growth. The application of enhanced oil recovery techniques, consolidation of ownership, automation of drilling, and rationalizing of supply chains will increase the volume of oil extracted over the lifetime of a well and reduce costs. But it won’t deliver the same pace of growth as seen recently.The recovery rate of oil from shale deposits is typically about 5%-10%, but ConocoPhillips has pushed recovery as high as 20% in some parts of the Eagle Ford shale play in Texas, and it could reach 40% under the right circumstances. The upside to the lifetime recovery rate from Eagle Ford would be huge, potentially extending higher production rates for longer.The third shale boom is coming. Just don’t expect it to look like the first two.To contact the author of this story: Julian Lee at jlee1627@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Julian Lee is an oil strategist for Bloomberg.

2019-10-08	2019-10-08 13:25:34	COP	ConocoPhillips	Conoco and Saudi Aramco Know What You Want	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Discretion won't get you anywhere with oil investors these days. They want pledges, not plans.ConocoPhillips is bumping up its dividend by 38%. The company also issued guidance for buybacks next year of $3 billion, down from this year’s expected $3.5 billion. The dividend increase is roughly the size of that $500 million difference. It seems to be worth more, though: Conoco was one of only a few large-cap oil stocks to close up on Monday, adding about $1.7 billion of market cap relative to the sector.(1)Dividends, like stock buybacks, are technically discretionary, but boards are loath to cut them except in dire circumstances. Conoco has a history here, having come unstuck in early 2016 when oil prices troughed. Even after the latest raise, the new dividend is still 43% lower than back then. Buybacks have helped make up that gap in cash terms, albeit with something of an out if things turned sour again. So Conoco effectively taking $500 million from the prospective buyback column and putting it in the dividend pledge signals confidence in its ability to weather any storm – which isn’t nothing, given how ugly 2020 might be. Similarly, a certain ginormous national oil company with its eye on an IPO has gone all out to convince investors that future  dividends are as good as in their pockets. Saudi Arabian Oil Co. issued guidance last week of a “base dividend” of $75 billion in 2020, albeit “at the board's discretion.” As I wrote here, even Saudi Aramco’s prodigious profits may not necessarily cover that if Brent crude averages $60 rather than $70.As it turns out, Aramco’s website now hosts an updated presentation with a whole new slide on its “dividend prioritisation mechanism,” which is a fancy way of saying it will guarantee a minimum payment to minority shareholders for five years; like a temporary preferred stock. They would get a minimum of their pro-rata share of a $75 billion dividend regardless of whether Aramco actually paid that in total, while the government would just get their portion of whatever actual amount was declared. In other words, if investors end up buying 5% in an IPO, they would get a collective payout of at least $3.75 billion a year through 2024, come what may.The cost to the government in terms of potentially foregone payments looks negligible. Even if Aramco’s crude oil output averaged just 9.5 million barrels a day and Brent averaged just $55 a barrel, Riyadh would forego an aggregate $5 billion in payments spread across five years (using my numbers and assuming a 5% free float).Even so, the sudden switch from the “board’s discretion” to we’ll-pay-come-what-may is striking. It fits with the recently announced change in Aramco’s royalty rates, which effectively negate any gains for investors if oil spikes above $100 but boost the capacity to pay dividends at today’s levels. Aramco’s owner wants this IPO done at a high valuation and appears to recognize nobody’s buying oil companies today because of what oil might do in the future; rather, they’ll consider it if there’s a steady check guaranteed upfront.While oil companies compete in terms of free cash flow yields, they’re all fighting for attention in a stock market that has become largely indifferent to the sector. Conoco has actually been an exemplar of prioritizing payouts and cutting costs since 2016, yet its stock has languished so far this year. The dividend bump, coming a month before a strategy update, feels like an attempt to reset things, taking Conoco’s yield above 3% to a wider relative yield premium – or valuation discount – versus the market. French oil major Total SA also announced a dividend hike a couple of weeks ago, essentially promising to pay out every cent of an anticipated $5 billion increase in projected cash flows through 2025. Exxon Mobil Corp., meanwhile, continues its long track record of raising its dividend but finds its stock now yields north of 5% anyway, close to its highest levels ever since the merger with Mobil. That may reflect the long absence of buybacks, which, for this company, were once regarded as a given. However, it may have more to do with the fact that Exxon is effectively borrowing to pay its current dividend.Buybacks remain useful window displays for company management; certainly, Chevron Corp.’s resumption of them has helped put Exxon in the shade. Yet, as Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, puts it: “A dividend is a promise and share repurchase is a goal.” Dividends offer a surer constraint on capex budgets and more of an obligation to pay out cash sooner rather than later in a sector grappling with intimations of mortality. Investor decks emphasize resilience against adversity rather than dangling the prospect of a windfall. Even Aramco has had to take the extraordinary step of guaranteeing a payout, which doesn’t exactly scream bullishness on oil.Markets are often said to be driven by just two emotions: fear and greed. The majors’ shifting payout priorities appear to be a perfect synthesis of the two.(1) Conoco's stock was up 2.1% versus the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund's 0.9% decline.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2019-10-01	2019-10-01 19:17:44	COP	ConocoPhillips	Conoco’s Shift to Keep Canadian Synthetic Oil Under Pressure	(Bloomberg) -- ConocoPhillips’s shift to a cheaper substitute to dilute the thick bitumen coming from its oil-sands operations may deal a blow to companies that turn heavy oil into more-valuable lighter grades.The company currently uses synthetic crude produced in local upgraders to thin out the bitumen extracted from wells at its 150,000 barrel-a-day Surmont site. But by end of the fourth quarter, Surmont will be able to switch to using condensate -- a very light hydrocarbon produced from natural-gas wells -- as a diluent instead, according to documents submitted to the Alberta Energy Regulator.Using condensate to dilute the heavy crude so it can flow through pipelines has some advantages. While an entire barrel of synthetic crude is typically needed to dilute one barrel of raw bitumen, half a barrel of condensate is needed. Also, condensate is almost $3 a barrel cheaper, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Work to enable our Surmont 2 central processing facility to utilize either condensate or synthetic crude oil is nearly complete,” Katherine Springall, spokeswoman for ConocoPhillips Canada, said in an email. “While we currently use a small percentage of condensate in our blend, this work, when complete, will allow us to use either diluent in order to react to changing market conditions.”A switch by the Surmont operation to 100% condensate would amount to more than 10% of the total volume of synthetic crude produced in Canada, according to Canadian Energy Regulator data. That loss of demand may depress prices of synthetic crude, hurting companies such as Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. that process bitumen in refinery-sized plants called upgraders to make the lighter grades. Neither company returned emails seeking comment.Sturgeon RefinerySurmont isn’t the only headwind for synthetic crude demand. By year-end, the North West Redwater Partnership’s 79,000 barrel-a-day Sturgeon refinery in Alberta is poised to start processing bitumen rather than the synthetic crude it’s been using since early last year.Synthetic crude prices have weakened ahead of the changes. After trading at a premium to West Texas Intermediate futures since June, the grade flipped to a discount last week and is now trading at $1.10 a barrel below WTI, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Edmonton condensate strengthened Tuesday, with the discount shrinking $1.05 to $3.60 a barrel.Oil-sands producers have been switching to condensate from synthetic for several years after upgrader breakdowns caused shortages. Cnooc Ltd.’s Long Lake site, as well as Surmont, were forced to throttle back output two years ago after Syncrude Canada Ltd.’s upgrader went down. Athabasca Oil Corp.’s Leismer site, previously owned by Equinor ASA, switched to condensate before the Syncrude disruption.The loss of local consumption from Surmont and Sturgeon could be partly offset by demand from refiners elsewhere, Kevin Birn, IHS Markit’s director of North American crude oil markets, said by telephone. International regulations will require oceangoing ships to burn lower-sulfur fuel oil or diesel starting next year, a change that is expected to boost refiners’ thirst for lighter, lower-sulfur grades of crude that yield higher-quality fuel.“Synthetic crude is particularly attractive in that world,” Birn said.But an increase in exports would place more pressure on Canada’s already-rationed pipelines, according to Birn. Alberta’s largest oil producers are under mandatory production limits after delays in building new lines caused local oil prices to collapse last year.(Adds condensate price in seventh paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Robert Tuttle in Calgary at rtuttle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Catherine Traywick, Mike JeffersFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conoco-shift-keep-canadian-synthetic-234700604.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-09-19	2019-09-19 20:05:59	COP	ConocoPhillips	7 lsquo;Strong Buyrsquo; Oil Stocks to Buy Now	Oil stocks have been put through the volatility wringer of late.On Sept. 14, drones attacked a key processing facility in Abqaiq as well as an oil field in Khurais, temporarily knocking out about 5.7 million barrels of Saudi daily production. That represents half of Saudi Arabia's output and approximately 5% of global oil supply, so unsurprisingly, the news sent U.S. crude oil prices soaring by almost 15% on Sept. 16 - the largest gain in more than 30 years.But a day later, oil pulled back nearly 6% following Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman's announcement that the country's oil production will be back at normal levels by the end of September. Crude closed another 2% lower Sept. 18.Was this merely a quick flash in the pan for energy investors? Maybe. But heightened regional tensions still could bode well for oil prices in the coming months. And Citi analysts argue that the attacks highlight a fundamental problem for the kingdom's oil production. &quot;No matter whether it takes Saudi Arabia five days or a lot longer to get oil back into production, there is but one rational takeaway from this weekend's drone attacks on the Kingdom's infrastructure - that infrastructure is highly vulnerable to attack, and the market has been persistently mispricing oil,&quot; they write.Here are seven analyst-loved oil stocks to buy in this volatile energy environment. Here, we've used TipRanks' stock screener to find energy stocks that have earned a Strong Buy consensus rating from the analyst community over the past three months. We'll examine each one, including price targets and what the pros are saying about their potential.

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 22:00:11	COP	ConocoPhillips	This Tiny Nation Should Beware China's Belt and Road	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Given a sad history of exploitation by foreigners, the young democracy of Timor-Leste can hardly be blamed for being hell-bent on self-sufficiency. But its current drive to cement its independence risks squandering the faltering progress the country has made. If the government doesn’t tread carefully, a future of debt peonage to China beckons.Friday marks the 20th anniversary of the final dark episode in Timor-Leste’s 24-year occupation by Indonesia, which killed about 100,000 Timorese and came after centuries of colonial neglect by Portugal. On Aug. 30, 1999, a referendum delivered an overwhelming majority in favor of independence for the half-island also known as East Timor, but unleashed a wave of retaliation from Indonesian forces and militias that left more than 1,400 dead and destroyed public infrastructure.Australia, the most forthright defender of Timor-Leste in that period, turned around to betray its new neighbor five years later. During negotiations over how to divide the oil and gas reserves along the undersea boundary between the two nations, Canberra used the cover of a foreign aid project to install listening devices in the office of Timor-Leste’s prime minister and eavesdropped on negotiating tactics, thus winning a larger share of resources for itself.Timor-Leste has nonetheless managed to pick itself up. Gross domestic product per capita more than tripled in the first decade after formal independence in 2002, before slumping with oil prices in the years since. Infant mortality rates have been cut nearly in half, while secondary school enrollment has roughly doubled.More to the point, the nation’s mineral wealth has been managed with more foresight than is normally the case with poor, newly independent states.The country’s Petroleum Fund has assets of around $15.8 billion, equivalent to more than eight years’ worth of non-petroleum GDP. Relative to the size of the economy, that’s larger than the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait or Norway. Drawing on fund surpluses to finance budget deficits has left Timor-Leste with minimal levels of public debt. In terms of corruption, the country scores around the same levels as Brazil, Thailand and Colombia, and ahead of Vietnam – not a terrible result, given the circumstances.It’s not all so positive. Half of employment is in agriculture, mostly at subsistence levels, and the country struggles to feed itself. Levels of undernourishment have declined only slightly and remain among the world’s highest.Worse lies ahead. The Bayu-Undan offshore gasfield which has provided Timor-Leste’s petroleum wealth for the past few decades will run out by 2023. The Petroleum Fund will be exhausted a few years later, according to one 2014 study. Further revenues will depend on developing the nearby Greater Sunrise field – and there the problems of self-sufficiency become most apparent.Bayu-Undan’s gas was brought ashore in the Australian city of Darwin, but Timor-Leste’s government is determined that Greater Sunrise product will be processed at home as the heart of a major new industrial zone, known as Tasi Mane. For all the powerful nation-building symbolism and potential revenue from such a plant, Tasi Mane may never be viable – especially given the collapse in gas prices and extreme difficulty around the world in financing major new projects. Building a whole new facility on Timor-Leste’s coast will cost around $12 billion, according to a 2016 report, even making the dubious assumption that it’s physically possible to build a pipeline through the seismically unstable Timor Trough to get there. A far better option would be to hook into the ready-made export terminal in Darwin or use a floating LNG plant instead – but those have been ruled out by Timor-Leste’s government.“The Timorese leadership has thrown all their economic eggs in this one basket because it has limited other options,” said Bec Strating, an expert on the country at Melbourne’s La Trobe University, “but I’ve never met an oil or gas expert who thinks this is a workable project.”The original commercial partners in Greater Sunrise are voting with their feet. Timor-Leste spent $650 million over the past year buying ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell Plc out of the venture, leaving only Woodside Petroleum Ltd. and Osaka Gas Co. The former has been adamant it won’t put significant amounts into developing Tasi Mane. With commercial finance steering clear, the most likely option increasingly looks like China’s Belt and Road Initiative. National oil company Timor Gap earlier this year signed a $943 million construction contract with a unit of state-owned China Railway Construction Corp. Countries in the region “go where they can to obtain either grants or soft loans,” former Timorese President Jose Ramos-Horta said in an interview with SBS News last year. “And that, today, is China.”Such a prospect risks a tragic waste of Timor-Leste’s potential. The Belt and Road is already notorious for building costly bridges to nowhere that leave governments with little to show beyond hefty interest bills. China’s growing presence in the Indo-Pacific via the Belt and Road has raised concerns that military and strategic aims, rather than purely commercial logic, underlie many of the projects. A $500 million highway built for Tasi Mane by a Chinese consortium in recent years and a $120 million airport are looking like white elephants.Gas-export plants are in any case too narrow a base for a national economy, with just 350 local employees at the ConocoPhillips terminal in Darwin. More likely, the orgy of contracts that a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure project would kick off will offer a potent temptation for the sort of public corruption that Timor-Leste has so far mostly been spared. It’s understandable that this young country feels betrayed by its neighbors. Entering a new abusive relationship with Beijing isn’t likely to be the right way to secure its future.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 17:24:37	COP	ConocoPhillips	Enbridge Oil-Shipping Revamp Hits Snag as Regulator Steps In	(Bloomberg) -- Enbridge Inc.’s proposed shift to long-term crude shipping contracts on its Mainline pipeline network is drawing the ire of a growing number of producers, and now Canada’s energy regulator is getting involved, which could delay the process.After ConocoPhillips and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. became the latest companies to object to Enbridge’s search for long-term shipping commitments, the regulator on Tuesday asked all involved to present their views. It’s asking for arguments on whether the so-called open season should be delayed until the new system has been approved by the regulator. Enbridge has argued that it needs the commitments before it seeks approval.The tussle is just the latest outcome of a pipeline bottleneck that’s dogging the Canadian oil industry as producers await major projects like Keystone XL and the Trans Mountain expansion to be built. With a dearth of options, producers fear a shift from the current monthly sign-up system will leave them less room to maneuver.Enbridge says that long-term contracts, which would only apply to Canadian segments of the system, would be the best way to balance the needs of all shippers. The change could also lend an advantage to some of the largest refiners in the U.S. Midwest, such as BP Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp., who source crude on the Mainline, according to Mike Walls, an analyst at Genscape Inc.“Producers are concerned that if a relative few large refiners in the U.S. control a large portion of the Mainline space, their access to customers will be limited as well as their ability to get to more diverse markets like the Gulf Coast,” Walls said in an email. “They would have less spot capacity and in the end would have to sell to the owners of the committed capacity.”Exxon declined to comment. BP didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Enbridge wants to reserve as much as 90% of space on the Mainline to companies with multiyear contracts, charging them whether they ship oil on the line or not. The 2.8 million barrel-a-day Mainline has seen heavy rationing as surging production has run into nationwide pipeline bottlenecks. Enbridge aims to start sending contracted volumes down the line in 2021.“The offering that we’ve got in that open season is responding to the needs of our customers and is supported by shippers representing the majority of the volume on our system,” Guy Jarvis, Enbridge’s executive vice president for liquids pipelines, said by phone. In his objection Tuesday, Canadian Natural President Tim McKay argued that the plan disadvantages non-integrated producers in favor of “shippers who can supply their own downstream” facilities.Separately, ConocoPhillips Canada President Kirk Johnson said the plan creates uncertainty for companies with contracts to ship on connecting pipelines such as the Flanagan South system that runs from Illinois to Oklahoma. The plan already has drawn objections from Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest integrated energy producer, as well as oil-sands driller MEG Energy Corp. and the Explorers & Producers Association of Canada, which represents small- and medium-sized producers.To contact the reporters on this story: Robert Tuttle in Calgary at rtuttle@bloomberg.net;Kevin Orland in Calgary at korland@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Carlos Caminada, Simon CaseyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enbridge-pipeline-contracts-seen-putting-110000044.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-08-28	2019-08-28 07:00:10	COP	ConocoPhillips	BP's Alaska Exit Is a Sign of Oil's Times	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There goes the other pipeline. Back in the day, BP Plc was sometimes dismissed as a “two-pipelines company.” This referred to two of its biggest positions: The Forties field and pipeline system in the North Sea and the Trans Alaska Pipeline bringing oil south from the Prudhoe Bay wells in Alaska. Forties was sold off in 2003 (the field) and 2017 (the pipes). Now, BP is leaving Alaska.In some respects, the $5.6 billion sale of the company’s Alaska portfolio is par for the course. BP has been selling assets for much of this decade in order to fund compensation and reshape the business after 2010’s Macondo blowout. More generally, selling mature oil and gas fields to smaller, independent companies planning to squeeze out more is a standard part of the development cycle. In 2003, Apache Corp. took Forties; the Alaska sale is to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co. To be an oil major is to be constantly ranking projects in terms of potential and deciding if you’re better off keeping them or flogging them.Yet the symbolism is inescapable. Alaska is embedded deeply in BP’s history and identity. Former CEO Lord John Browne, who led the late 20th-century mega-mergers that transformed BP from a two-pipeline company, kicked off his career there in 1969, just after BP struck oil. One of those big deals he ended up doing, the $33 billion acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co. in 2000, was predicated in part on consolidating BP’s position in Alaska – only for antitrust regulators to force the sale of those particular assets to Phillips Petroleum Co. (now ConocoPhillips).Back then, BP was on the hunt for “elephants,” or giant oil and gas fields that typically took many years – and country-sized balance sheets – to develop. Hence Browne’s acquisition spree.The world has moved on. While producers still relish big discoveries, the intervening boom and bust in oil prices has made investors leery of big-ticket investments and more demanding in terms of payouts. Apart from, by and large, holding capex budgets in check, oil majors have been retreating from traditional strongholds, with Royal Dutch Shell Plc virtually leaving the Canadian oil sands, Chevron Corp. recently exiting the U.K. North Sea and Exxon Mobil Corp. putting its Norwegian assets up for sale. BP put its own Norwegian business into a joint venture in 2016.Meanwhile, they have been diverting cash to dividends and buybacks in order to keep investors onside – BP’s stock yields almost 7% – as well as directing more of their capex to shorter-cycle shale development.BP paid BHP Group Plc $10.5 billion in cash for its shale assets last year. Besides reducing BP’s leverage at a dicey time for oil prices, the Alaska deal can be seen as swapping out of an old, conventional position to help fund expansion in unconventional oil and gas. In that sense, selling Alaska throws the spotlight on these new assets where, like several of its peers, BP is trying to prove that the majors’ scale – which worked in such places as Alaska – can also be an advantage in shale.Alaska is viewed by some as a growth area, particularly – with grim irony – as climate change and the energy-dominance aspirations of the current U.S. administration open up more of it for potential development. However, as a sensitive, remote and challenging environment, it carries extra risks and costs for producers, including the potential for future administrations to restrict activity there again. The state’s oil boom truly began when the panic of the 1973 oil shock swept aside opposition to the construction of the Trans Alaska Pipeline. Its future from here will be shaped at least in part by the challenges of excess oil and associated emissions.Faced with this much change and the need to adapt, there really can be no sacred cash cows.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

Or with the specter of a recession looming, should they sit tight and buy at a better price?Let's take a closer look at XOM and see what's the verdict.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Increased Exploration Offers Opportunity (and Risk)As I discussed in July, the company is pursuing high-ROI exploration opportunities. So far, their Permian Basin project has been a large success. Based on the most recent earnings announcement, production is up 20% from the prior quarter, and up 90% year-over-year. The company's Guyana project is still in the early stages. But Exxon Mobil expects gross production could be over 750,000 barrels per day by 2025.Exxon Mobil stock needs exploration success to move the needle. The company's upstream operations are the current profit driver. Downstream (refining and marketing) operations continue to struggle. The refining unit swung from a $256 million loss in the first quarter of 2019 to $451 million in earnings for the second quarter. But quarterly earnings continue to be down from the prior year's quarter ($724 million).Refining margins are starting to improve, and the company is wrapping up required maintenance. XOM's chemical unit also continues to struggle. Unit earnings for the quarter were $188 million, down from $518 million in the first quarter of 2019.  * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects But it isn't all smooth sailing. A lot could change in the oil market between now and 2025. A global recession could cause oil prices to fall further. Even if Exxon's new exploration efforts have a low breakeven point, the return on investment would be impacted.As InvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth discussed last week, the company is taking a big risk boosting exploration efforts. The potential payoff is significant. But when oil could potentially fall further in the coming years, their capital investments may not produce a significant return. In addition, cash flow could decline, threatening both the dividend and the XOM stock price.With this in mind, is XOM stock worth the risk? Let's take a look at valuation and see how Exxon Mobil stock stacks up to peers. XOM Stock ValuationExxon Mobil stock continues to trade at a premium to its integrated oil and gas peers. XOM stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.4. The company's enterprise value/EBITDA ratio is 9.4. Here are the corresponding earnings multiples of the company's closest competitors:BP (NYSE:BP): Forward P/E of 9.4, EV/EBITDA of 5.8Chevron (NYSE:CVX): Forward P/E of 13.7, EV/EBITDA of 7.4ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP): Forward P/E of 12.1, EV/EBITDA of 4.1Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A, NYSE:RDS.B): Forward P/E of 9.2, EV/EBITDA of 5.5The company's high dividend yield (5.2%) may help sustain the XOM stock price. With interest rates continuing to fall, it's tough to find a high-quality 5%+ yield in today's market. But is the company's dividend sustainable? Exxon's payout ratio is currently almost 80%. This means that the company needs increased earnings to grow the dividend. XOM is for now a dividend aristocrat. But a tougher oil market and increased capital expenditures could change that. Any sort of slowdown in the annual dividend increase (or a dividend cut) could materially impact the XOM stock price. Exxon Mobil Stock Is Stable, But Not a Big OpportunityExxon Mobil stock is not the biggest opportunity in the oil and gas space. While the company is making big moves with their Permian and Guyana projects, this ramp-up in capital investment is going on as global oil prices remain volatile. If oil sees a jump in price over the next five years, the XOM stock price will see a massive boost. But if oil prices continue to fall, the company may not be able to continue their long track record of growing the dividend.What does this mean for investors? Should they avoid Exxon Mobil stock? The other oil and gas names may be better buying opportunities. But a material drop in the XOM stock price could make it a screaming buy. However, with the stock's current high yield, it is doubtful the stock will start trading closer to the valuation of its peers.XOM stock is stable, but look elsewhere for big returns.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-12	2019-08-12 16:06:51	COP	ConocoPhillips	3 Energy Stocks to Sell Now	Oil prices fell to their lowest levels since January last week as trade war fears returned. Energy stocks fell in sympathy and remain one of the weakest sectors heading into the new week. Today we'll analyze the downside reversal and identify three energy stocks to sell.Source: Shutterstock The easiest way to spot the bears' emergence in oil stocks is by using the Energy Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE). We saw downside momentum surge during last week's whack suggesting the downtrend should have staying power. Volume surged alongside the slide revealing mass distribution and an environment where rallies should be suspect. The mid-week recovery was cut short ahead of the weekend. Friday's bearish reversal candle is seeing follow through this morning making now a prime time to deploy short trades in the sector.  * 10 Real Estate Investments to Ride Out the Current Storm I've scoured its constituents and discovered three high-quality stocks to sell. Let's take a closer look.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Conoco Phillips (COP)Source: ThinkorSwim ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) carries one of the best characteristics for bearish candidates: relative weakness. This year's descent has far outpaced the energy sector making it one of the weakest large-gaps in the space. Last week's plunge pushed COP stock to a 52-week low, and it's now down 14% year-to-date.Thursday's rally was quickly reversed on Friday showing just how fast sellers are to reject any strength. With all major moving averages pointing lower and buyers unable to muster together more than a one-day rally, the path of least resistance remains lower.To bank on further weakness, buy the Nov $55/$50 bear put spread for $2.20. The risk is limited to the initial cost, and the reward is $2.80. Schlumberger (SLB)Source: ThinkorSwim Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) also slipped to a 52-week low last week and found itself down 5% year-to-date. While the damage isn't as severe as what we've seen in COP stock, SLB remains in a secular decline with countless failed rallies. Thursday's rebound attempt was pathetic and rapidly reversed by Friday's slide.I see zero reasons to be bullish here or fight the trend, which is pointing lower across all time frames.Implied volatility sits at a lofty 40% or the 56th percentile of its one-year range so short premium plays are attractive right now. This should allow us to build a cash flow trade with robust metrics.  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Sell Right Now If you're willing to bet SLB sits below $35 at September expiration then sell the $35/$37.50 bear call spread for 70 cents. The reward is 70 cents, and the risk is $1.80. Halliburton (HAL)Source: ThinkorSwim Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) rounds out our trio of bearish beauties. From a performance perspective, it's the worst of the three with a year-to-date loss of 27%. It has been poison to portfolios. Last week's oil drop didn't just push HAL stock to a new 52-week low; it knocked to its lowest level since 2009.As you would expect with such atrocious performance, everything on the chart points to lower prices. The trend on all time frames is cruising lower, moving averages are falling, and relative weakness has followed the stock like a hellhound.Implied volatility is sky-high at the 77th percentile of its one-year range. To combat the expensiveness of option premiums, spreads are a must.Buy the Oct $20/$17.50 bear put spread for around $1.05. The risk is limited to $1.05, and the reward is limited to $1.95.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-02	2019-08-02 21:11:29	COP	ConocoPhillips	Pay Up, Oil Traders. Trump’s Steel Tariffs Now Affect You Too	(Bloomberg) -- Oil traders will be paying for President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel.On Friday, Plains All American Pipeline LP issued tariff rates to ship on its 670,000 barrel-a-day Cactus II pipeline moving oil from the prolific Permian Basin to Corpus Christi, Texas.While the tariff detailed the difference in rates between those with long-term volume commitments and those looking to ship on a monthly, spot basis, it also included a small footnote that outlined an additional peculiar surcharge.This additional surcharge, at 5 cents a barrel, will be effective April 1 of next year and is in connection to “increased construction costs as a result of governmental regulation and tariffs.” The filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission adds that this fee will be assessed until such capital expenditures have been recovered by the owner.Trump’s tariffs on metal were put into place last year to aid the domestic steel industry as it competes with imports from abroad.It’s not the first time the oil industry has been impacted by steel tariffs. Last year, ConocoPhillips said that prices for steel used in pipes, valve fittings and other equipment rose by 26% since the start of 2018.Plains All American had earlier requested the federal government for relief from higher ferrous prices for Cactus II, citing that the duties will add $40 million to the cost of its Permian pipeline. The request was denied, however.To contact the reporter on this story: Catherine Ngai in New York at cngai16@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Joe CarrollFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pay-oil-traders-trump-steel-211129176.html?.tsrc=rss
2019-08-02	2019-08-02 20:14:56	COP	ConocoPhillips	10 Stock Picks That Should Love Lower Interest Rates	It's official. The United States' base interest rate, the Fed funds rate, has fallen for the first time in over a decade. The last time the Federal Reserve ratcheted interest rates lower was in 2008, when the subprime mortgage meltdown still was in full swing. The nation's central bank was willing to try almost anything to kickstart the recovery that finally took shape in 2009.The Fed's governors aren't nearly as desperate now as they were then. In fact, the country's economy remains surprisingly robust. Despite the measurable impact of an expanding tariff war with China and a handful of other trade partners, last quarter's initial GDP growth estimate of 2.1% topped expectations. While S&P; 500 corporate earnings for the second quarter are off 2.6% year-over-year so far, they're still expected to grow through at least 2020. The nation's unemployment rate remains near multiyear lows, too.&quot;The trajectory of growth is really turning a corner, and the Fed is trying to be proactive,&quot; Glenmede Investment Strategy Officer Michael Reynolds told Bankrate ahead of the decision. &quot;The way we view an insurance rate cut is, it's a proactive move to protect against what seems to be potential but unpredictable risks.&quot;The Federal Reserve may not be done pushing interest rates lower, either. Futures traders are betting on another quarter-point cut being put in place in September, when the FOMC is slated to make such a decision again.Interest-rate cuts have a slew of effects that in turn help bolster some companies while chipping away at others. With a new lower-rate paradigm starting to gel, here are 10 stock picks that are perfectly positioned to get the most out of this environment of cheaper money.

2019-08-02	2019-08-02 13:30:53	COP	ConocoPhillips	Bad Week for Energy Stocks? Wait Till Next Year	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One word to describe this week in energy stocks is “painful.” Another is prologue.Energy stocks were not particularly popular coming into this week anyway. To one degree or another, they were losing the confidence of investors that they will manage their capital responsibly and profitably.Now their deserved reputation for squeezing ever more oil and gas out of shale has also taken a big knock. Concho Resources Inc. plunged 22% on Thursday, to its lowest level since the panic of early 2016, after it cut guidance and revealed weak results from an experimental project of drilling wells much closer together than usual. Other Permian producers, such as Diamondback Energy Inc., also took a hit on fears this reflects a shale-productivity issue, rather than just a Concho issue. It’s sobering to think that Concho, valued at more than $23 billion in the spring of 2018 and having since absorbed the $7.6 billion purchase of RSP Permian Inc., now sports a market cap of less than $16 billion.Meanwhile, the industry also has a problem with a man who is nominally its champion: President Donald Trump. His offhand tweet-threat of more tariffs on Chinese goods on Thursday afternoon took what was already a flaming dumpster fire, hitched it to a truck and took it straight over a precipice (the Federal Reserve’s quarter-point rate cut fading quickly in the rear-view).Trust, trip-ups, Trump. They seem like separate problems for the sector, but they actually add up to the same problem: cost of capital.Equity and bond issuance has faltered across the energy sector. Services giant Schlumberger Ltd., which has talked consistently of a recovery for several years, just changed its CEO, and its stock languishes around levels plumbed during the financial crisis. The pipeline sector, meanwhile, is undergoing a painful transformation away from the once-dominant (and so hot) master limited partnership structure. Missed expectations there are punished swiftly, while good behavior is rewarded with a stable, rather than surging, stock price.Concho’s problems with its “Dominator” project affected only a small minority of the wells it has drilled so far this year. But investor tolerance for wasted capital – as well as sharp revisions to guidance given only a few months ago – has evaporated. When Pioneer Natural Resources Co. surprised in mid-2017 with a snafu of its own, its stock was trading at parity with the market and a one-third premium to the sector in terms of Ebitda multiple. It never recovered that poise. Today, it trades below both.Many companies in an industry predicated on growth are struggling to make the pivot to prioritizing return on capital and shareholder payouts. It has traditionally been a sector that took in capital rather than spat it out. This is a particular problem for smaller and mid-cap companies, which tend to carry higher unit costs and struggle to attract attention and investors (though not, of late, activists). And a new report from Rystad Energy, a research and analytics firm, suggests smaller is worse when it comes to productivity too(1):The basic equation here – rising cost of capital and flat-but-volatile oil prices – demands radical change. There’s really no reason why dozens and dozens of companies should be cheek-by-jowl in the Permian basin, other than a steady flow of external capital that has dried up.If, as seems likely, 2020 hosts a confluence of weaker economic growth – with added Twitter trade-war frisson – and high non-OPEC production growth, this week’s wash-out will have been a mere prologue to what’s coming. The cure is consolidation, which would cut costs and rein in the barrels pushing into an already oversupplied market. However, it appears we still aren’t quite there yet.One obvious potential acquirer, ConocoPhillips, was asked on this week’s earnings call whether falling E&P valuations had piqued its interest. In response, the COO said:We still believe that there is a mismatch between what people expect for their assets and what we compete as a use of capital for our capital, and that may change over time.Translation: Stuff isn’t cheap enough yet.One obstacle to deals is, paradoxically, something that also lies behind the sector’s chronic de-rating: misaligned incentives for management vis-a-vis shareholders. In a new report, Evercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson calculates that, for a sample of nine large E&P companies, the average value of the pool of stock and option awards held by their CEOs at the end of 2016 was $26 million. By the end of 2018, that had risen by $21 million – of which just $1 million reflected higher share prices; the rest was new awards. The total return of the E&P sector in that time was negative 35%.As long as the corner office enjoys a more positive outcome than shareholders do, it suppresses any willingness to negotiate a deal that could change the occupant of that corner office. As this week demonstrates, though, pressure for change is building inexorably. The cost of capital is getting just too damn high.(1) In the accompanying chart, 'Majors' refers to BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell.

2019-07-30	2019-07-30 13:55:55	COP	ConocoPhillips	Even Boone Pickens Is Falling Out of Love With Oil	(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Venerable oil baron T. Boone Pickens is giving up on oil – sort of. Less than 18 months ago, his fund launched an ETF tracking stocks of companies expected to benefit from any increase in Brent crude oil prices. But soon, BOON – the ticker of the NYSE Pickens Oil Response ETF – will be no more. Instead, it will be relaunched as RENW, offering exposure to stocks benefiting from the transition to toward “a low-carbon economy.”BOON’s most obvious problem was that it hadn’t really lived up to its ticker as far as investors are concerned. Underperforming the Brent oil price by about 7 percentage points since launch isn’t catastrophic. Worse perhaps is the fact that the ETF didn’t really partake in last fall’s oil rally (less than half its holdings are classified as “energy” companies). Still, that shielded it somewhat from the subsequent crash, unlike more heavily exposed E&P funds.Move past the symbolism, and there’s a simpler tale here.Not too long ago, the E&P sector had a shortage of oil and a trove of trust. Today, those positions are entirely reversed. Buoyed by the “peak oil” scare of the prior decade, investors funded a drilling spree, including in U.S. tight-oil basins. The result is a languid oil market barely able to rouse itself even when conflict threatens in the Persian Gulf. Return on that investment bled away to bad bets, cost-inflation and, all too often, fattened pay and perks in the c-suite. Meanwhile, Big Tech (among other sectors) competes successfully for investors’ interest. Less than a decade ago, pundits speculated on the meaning of Apple Inc.’s market cap tentatively overtaking Exxon Mobil Corp. to be the biggest in the world. Now, it is just normal that Exxon isn’t even in the top 10 (it is 13th right now).Despite oil prices more than doubling since the trough of early 2016, energy’s weight in the S&P 500 Index has actually slipped further, from more than 6% then to an all-time low of about 4.8% today.Looking at that relationship between energy’s weight and the oil price over the long term reveals a sobering trend for the industry. The chart below divides the annual real Brent oil price by energy’s weighting to provide a ratio that can be thought of like this: How many real dollars per barrel does it take to buy the sector one percentage point in the S&P 500?Before you begin drafting that email, this isn’t intended to say there’s a hard and fast relationship between where oil is trading and where the energy sector’s weighting should settle. The direction of that line is undeniable, however.For most of the two decades leading up to 2000, the relationship was pretty stable, as oil prices fell in real terms from the spike of 1979, and the sector’s relative value drifted down with it. That changed as the supercycle took hold after 1998. Oil equities rallied strongly – the sector more than tripled by mid-2008 – though not as much as the underlying commodity. That makes sense, as cyclical rallies, even daubed with the motto of “peak oil,” aren’t expected to last forever, and cost inflation within the business was becoming quite evident by 2006.The real oil price demanded to support the sector’s place in the index has kicked into overdrive this decade. That is also partly a reflection of the underlying commodity, as rallies since 2014 have faded quickly amid excess supply.But it’s also due to that shortage of trust. Investors have been conditioned to expect energy firms to allocate any windfall from rising oil prices to drilling budgets, M&A or executive pay, with precious little making its way back to shareholders. Also, unlike in the early 2000s, they now worry more about “peak demand” and climate change (hence, RENW’s imminent emergence from BOON’s chrysalis). So it takes a lot of dollars per barrel to persuade them there will be some left over for distributions.That is changing as some companies, particularly at the bigger end of the scale, have adopted strategies prioritizing payouts explicitly. The deficit is large, however. For example, ConocoPhillips has been the exemplar of putting returns over growth in the past few years. However, its stock actually traded down on Tuesday morning after reporting capital expenditure came in about $200 million above expectations in the second quarter – despite twinning that with a $500 million bump to share buybacks.Yet Conoco’s playbook remains sensible. If energy stocks are proving unresponsive to oil then, like Boone Pickens, it’s time for a radical change of approach.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

Adjusted per-share earnings came to $1.01, below the FactSet consensus of $1.04. The company did not provide a revenue number, but said production excluding Libya came to 1.290 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED), exceeding the high end of its guidance. The company generated cash from operating activities of $2.9 billion. Excluding working capital, cash from operations came to $3.4 billion exceeding capex and investments, generating free cash flow of $1.7 billion. The company is expecting third-quarter production to 1,290 to 1,330 MBOED and full-year production of 1,310 to 1,340 MBOED. Both exclude Libya. &quot;Operating plan capital is now expected to be $6.3 billion versus $6.1 billion, attributable to additional exploration and appraisal drilling in Alaska and the addition of a drilling rig in the Eagle Ford Field at mid-year,&quot; the company said in a statement. Shares fell about 1% premarket and are down 6.7% in 2019, while the S&P 500  has gained 20.5%.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/16bb4010-62ed-3830-ac0b-e659aa24592e/conocophillips-q2-net-income.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-07-25	2019-07-25 12:10:51	COP	ConocoPhillips	Credibility Issues Are Going to Keep Weighing down BP Stock	Say what you want about big oil firms: at the end of the day, they represent an indispensable part of our everyday lives. Until the time that renewable energy sources take over, oil is essentially what powers our high-tech societies. However, that concept alone hasn't done much for BP (NYSE:BP) or the BP stock price.As our own Dana Blankenhorn explained earlier this year, the company was at the center of the Deepwater Horizon explosion. Aside from sparking yet another Mark Wahlberg movie, the oil-rig explosion caused severe damage to the Gulf of Mexico. And after nearly a decade removed from the incident, Deepwater Horizon still levers an unfortunate impact on the ecosystem.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor environmentalists and those concerned about big corrupt corporations, it's quite fitting that the BP stock price never recovered from the incident. It got close in 2014, but for the most part, shares have traded well inside a bearish trend channel.  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season But even more startling, BP essentially hasn't moved on an adjusted basis since 1997. To put that into perspective, some of our readers weren't even born at that time.This is Wall Street's version of the money pit: BP does just enough to keep you interested. However, it never reaches its true potential.And Blankenhorn makes a strong case that you shouldn't hold your breath. The company is deeply in debt, oil supplies are booming everywhere, and renewables are making substantial progress. As a trade, the stock might be worth a shot. However, its days as a long-term investment are gone. BP Stock is a 50/50 PropositionUndeniably, the British multinational oil firm is one of the most frustrating names within the energy sector. Companies like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) have at least made progress since the 1990s.As I stated earlier, the BP stock price is largely flat over the same period.One of the reasons is that the stock price and oil prices don't have the strongest correlation. Let's face it: surging gasoline prices starting from the early 2000s coincided with the run-up in big oil.  Click to EnlargeUnfortunately, BP really didn't benefit from oil demand. Between June 1999 and June 2019, the correlation coefficient between oil prices and the stock price was only 54%. That's not the greatest strength in terms of a direct relationship between the two metrics.  However, from January 2017 onward, the correlation coefficient is 86%. In other words, as oil prices rise, so too does the BP stock price. Additionally, I would argue that finally, BP is becoming a rational or logical investment by tracking the underlying oil market.In terms of trading, I think this is good news. If you can forecast oil prices, you'll statistically have a better chance at actualizing profits from BP.But predicting the oil market is an especially tricky affair right now. Blankenhorn referenced reports that oil demand from automobiles will peak in the mid-2020s. If I'm reading the long-term chart for Brent Crude objectively, I admit this is a big concern.Oil prices peaked in the summer of 2008, and it has never reached that lofty point since then. Moreover, &quot;black gold&quot; appears to be charting a series of lower highs. BP Stock Has a Small Chance of SuccessIf oil declines or goes rangebound, I'm not sure if I trust BP. After all, the data suggests that the BP stock price is dependent upon a robust underlying market. Anything less than that may cripple shares because the company has a credibility problem.That said, I think oil prices may tick up. Due to a strong labor market, for example, more people are traveling. Yes, historically lower fuel prices may contribute to that, but robust labor plays a far larger role. Eventually, if this trend continues, oil prices will rise due to normal supply-demand dynamics.Finally, I think the renewable energy case as it relates to autos is overstated. While electric vehicles have captured consumer attention, they require an overhaul of our energy infrastructure. Even if that occurs, what happens if millions of drivers plug in their EVs during a record-breaking heatwave?As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-19	2019-07-19 11:50:25	COP	ConocoPhillips	Stable Dividend, Minimal Growth Makes Exxon Mobil Stock a Hold	Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) stock is treading water. After rallying from roughly $69 in January up to over $83 in April, shares in the oil and gas giant have dipped below the $75 level.Source: Shutterstock While offering a solid dividend yield, a lack of catalysts means the XOM stock price will likely stay within the $70 to $80 trading range. Read on to see why Exxon Mobil stock continues to be a hold. Downstream Business Facing ChallengesFor the first quarter of 2019, the big oil firm saw quarterly earnings fall from $6 billion to $2.35 billion. Downstream (refining) was the biggest cause of the earnings decline.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne-time events such as asset sales in Q4 can explain some of the downstream earnings decline. But the lion's share was due to lower refining margins. The downstream segment went from a $2.7 billion profit in Q4 2018 to a $256 million loss in Q1 2019.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Scheduled maintenance was another factor in the downstream unit's weak performance. Moreover, the company expects to spend similar amounts on maintenance in Q2. Upstream Offers Stability in XOM StockWhile the downstream business faces headwinds, upstream provides some positives for the XOM stock price. The company continues to increase production in the Permian Basin. Exxon Mobil's exploration off the coast of Guyana has also yielded strong production opportunities.In their June 2019 JP Morgan Energy Conference presentation, Guyana and other projects provide a high internal rate of return with a low breakeven rate. The company's expertise in developing new production partially outweighs the cyclicality of the downstream refining business.The relative strength of the exploration and production segment has blunted refining challenges. But additional weakness across Exxon Mobil's other business lines could hurt Q2 results. Q2 Earnings OutlookExxon Mobil is scheduled to release Q2 earnings in early August. While the company expects improved refining margins, this may not be enough to counter additional issues. Analysts project the oil firm's natural gas and chemical businesses to lower operating earnings.A decline in natural gas prices offsets an estimated $400 million to $600 million boost to Exxon Mobil's profitability from increased crude oil prices. Low margins and continued maintenance negatively impact the chemical unit.While earnings growth does not appear to be in the cards, there is a positive takeaway: Exxon Mobil stock continues to pay out a solid dividend, providing income-oriented investors a strong reason to consider a position. XOM Remains a Dividend AristocratExxon Mobil stock has seen annual dividend increases for 37 consecutive years. The five-year average growth rate of the dividend is 5.6%. With a current dividend yield of 4.6%, XOM stock is a solid opportunity for passive-income investors.The XOM stock price receives strong price support from the dividend. This somewhat coerces Exxon Mobil to continue the payouts to keep shareholders happy.Without a long-time rise in oil prices, it may be tough for XOM to continue growing the dividend. However, thanks to continued global demand for oil, the company may have the long-term earnings growth necessary to sustain approximately six annual dividend increases.But can investors count on the dividend yield alone to deliver value? Is the current valuation sustainable, or could the XOM stock price see additional declines? Let's see how Exxon Mobil compares to its peers: Exxon Mobil Stock Overvalued Relative to PeersAt the current XOM stock price, the company trades for 20.2-times forward earnings, and an enterprise value (EV)/EBITDA ratio of 9.7. This valuation appears stretched relative to the company's integrated oil and gas rivals:BP (NYSE: BP): 13-times trailing earnings, EV/EBITDA of 6Chevron (NYSE: CVX): 16.9-times forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 8ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP): 12.4-times forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 4.8Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A): 11-times earnings, EV/EBITDA of 5.9One may think that the XOM stock premium is the result of a high dividend. But Exxon Mobil stock does not have the highest yield: For instance, BP has a 6.26% yield, while Royal Dutch Shell sports a 5.94% yield. And Chevron and ConocoPhillips aren't too far behind at 3.83% and 2.04%, respectively.Therefore, looking at both earnings power and dividend yield, it is crystal clear Exxon Mobil stock is not an outstanding opportunity for value or dividend investors. Bottom Line: Exxon Mobil Stock Is a HoldExxon Mobil stock has been hammered by weak refining margins. Despite these risks, XOM stock trades at a premium to its fellow integrated oil and gas companies.The company continues to be a dividend aristocrat, raising the payout for the 37th consecutive year. The dividend yield is solid, but not as high as those paid by BP and Royal Dutch Shell.With improved refining margins, Q2 earnings (anticipated for early August) could satisfy investors. However, weakness in natural gas and chemicals could outweigh a rebound in refining margins.With upside questionable but downside protected by the dividend play, XOM stock is a hold. Investors should consider entering a position if the company starts trading at a discount to its peers.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Chevron (CVX)Chevron (NYSE:CVX) shares are dropping away from the prior highs hit in March and April, setting the stage for a test of the April-May lows near $114, which would be worth a loss of roughly 7% from here.

2019-06-19	2019-06-19 18:56:44	COP	ConocoPhillips	7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for a Noisy Market	No matter where you look recently, the concept of stocks to buy in any industry looks risky. For years, poor and worsening relations between the U.S. and China have dominated media headlines. That situation does not appear to have an imminent solution. But several other factors are now weighing on domestic markets.First, the Trump administration threatened tariffs on imported goods on Mexico unless they helped control Central American migration. The two sides reached an agreement, but the underlying relationship is icy. Second, India has hit the U.S. with retaliatory tariffs due to the latter kicking out the former from its preferential-trade program. Finally, an inverting yield curve threatens the markets, including even viable blue-chip stocks.Again, from all angles, this environment looks like an absolute mess. Invariably, if these headwinds come to roost at once, we would face substantial volatility. Still, I'm confident in the longer-term case for blue-chip stocks to buy. No matter how bad the economy gets, companies must still get business done.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Expects to Soar for the Rest of 2019 Therefore, I think it pays to pick relevant, &quot;big-ticket&quot; names for your portfolio. Should the worst happen, they'll likely ride the storm better. If not, even better: a rising tide lifts all boats. With that in mind, here are seven blue-chip stocks to buy now: AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock Let's face facts: giant blue-chip stocks to buy are simply not in vogue anymore. Markets now place more emphasis on nimble organizations that can react to business changes. That's a good quality, particularly if a recession occurs. I still think some wiggle room exists if your name is AT&T (NYSE:T).Is T stock a perfect play? No. I understand the many criticisms that focus on AT&T's massive debt load. At just under $164 billion on the latest read, it's like the gross domestic product of a small nation. I also hear rumblings about its massive and so far disappointing deals, such as DirecTV. Finally, AT&T is hardly what you call a great growth opportunity.Those are all fair points. But it's also important to note that almost every business-related innovation of tomorrow will require 5G technology. With geopolitical tensions with our greatest adversaries in China and Russia, leading in 5G is absolutely critical. Like it or not, this simple fact benefits T stock, and I'm willing to roll with the punches. International Business Machines (IBM)Source: Shutterstock One of the aforementioned innovations that will benefit from the 5G rollout is the cloud; specifically, the mobile-cloud segment. Prior-generation mobile technologies lacked the connectivity speeds to make mobile-cloud apps anything but rudimentary. But once 5G becomes the new standard in wireless internet, it opens up the door for innovators like International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM).I concede that among blue-chip stocks to buy, Big Blue doesn't typically generate excitement. After a strong start to this year, pensive trading has characterized the last few months. Stakeholders of IBM stock are left to wonder if the company's old version is coming back to bite them.Certainly, I sympathize with the hesitation. However, I think it's important to understand that at its core, IBM stock represents viable, big-ticket synergies. IBM is one of the top cloud providers, but it's more than that. The company leads in multiple high-value technologies, such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, and automation.What has set back IBM stock in the past is a lack of cohesion in bringing these synergies together. But key acquisitions, such as the recent Red Hat deal, offers a new vision. Essentially, IBM is laying the groundwork for a comprehensive and scalable solution for cloud applications. We're really talking about IBM 2.0, but the market doesn't realize it yet. Therefore, this is easily one of the stocks to buy right now. ConocoPhillips (COP)Source: Shutterstock So much has changed over the past few decades. One huge development I noticed was in the parking lot of my local Target (NYSE:TGT) store. I noticed rows and rows of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) electric vehicles all waiting to park in a designated area. Initial confusion led to a quick realization: they're waiting their turn to &quot;gas&quot; up.Given the EV revolution, it's hard to imagine spending too much investor dollars on oil giants like ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Although COP stock benefits not just from automotive use, demand is demand. Back when EVs were not a thing, oil companies could play fast and loose with their pricing: at the end of the day, we could complain but what good would it do?Now that consumers have alternatives to fossil-fueled cars, it seems blue chips that are levered to traditional energy markets are going to plummet. However, EVs have their own quirks and inefficiencies that obviously don't make it to the dealership brochure. Plus, let's think about what would happen if EV owners had their way.Imagine if millions of EV owners across America decided to charge up their cars in the dead of summer: we're talking wide-scale brownouts and blackouts. And are we likely to upgrade our infrastructure to accommodate EVs? That's why you should still take a look at COP stock. Southern Co (SO)Source: Shutterstock Speaking of energy-related blue-chip stocks to buy, concerned investors should take a look at Southern Co (NYSE:SO). Logically, if we do have a comprehensive EV revolution, investments like SO stock could jump far higher than they already have.I want to point out that I'm not a fossil-fuel snob. Admittedly, it's a little weird when I see a car silently streak from a standstill to 60 miles per hour. And the cars from the green Formula E racing series sounds like a dog whistle…if I were a dog. But EVs are better for the environment and I get all that jazz.But folks, energy is energy, which requires conversion of a static element to a kinetic force. That process necessarily impacts the environment, but it's something that we all put up with to power our digital lifestyles.For sure, an underlying political factor exists. At some point in the future, fossil-fuel energy may go by the wayside. However, utility firms like Southern Co will very likely be always relevant. They represent an essential cog of our digitalization gear, which is why I like SO stock. Toyota (TM)Source: Shutterstock It's not a perfect comparison, but it's a good starting point for a discussion. On a year-to-date basis, Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) -- an automotive titan among blue-chip stocks to buy -- is up into double-digit territory, albeit slightly. Tesla, however, is staring at a staggering loss of nearly 30%.Of course, TM stock is winning bigly against TSLA, which is supposed to represent the best of American automotive engineering. I don't think this is a fluke. While the two companies differ in their choice of catalysts, they still have the same headwinds. For example, millennials don't really care for car ownership. Second, geopolitical tensions and trade-related conflicts impose significant pain. Thus, one is doing okay while the other is floundering under the same circumstances.Furthermore, after recently looking into the details of EV ownership, I've come to this conclusion: pure EVs are rich people's toys. They're quirky, lose significant capacity under temperature extremes, and for Tesla, they're not very reliable. That really hurts because EVs, with fewer moving parts, should be inherently more reliable than internal-combustion powered vehicles.Now let's consider the implications for TM stock. For decades, Toyota has garnered worldwide accolade for reliability. In fact, many of their cars are what I would call stupid-reliable. Plus, Toyota has the luxury Lexus brand that appeals to the snob.So while autos generally aren't a great play, TM is one of the stocks to buy for the long haul. Boeing (BA)Source: Phillip Capper via FlickrIf you're judging Boeing (NYSE:BA) strictly on the headlines, it's almost impossible not to have serious doubts. When the first fatal accident involving a Boeing 737 Max occurred, the company enjoyed the benefit of the doubt. As a result, BA stock experienced a relatively quick recovery from the Lion Air incident.But when a 737 Max operated by Ethiopian Airlines tumbled out of the sky, we had a horrific pattern. With mounting evidence against Boeing, BA stock had nowhere to go but down. Understandably, shares still haven't recovered from its bearish trajectory because the optics remain terrible. For instance, Boeing's CEO recently admitted mistakes in communicating the company's onboard-safety system that's at the center of the debate.Sadly, that's just the human-tragedy element of this story. BA stock also faces a competitive threat from Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY). Airbus offers very similar products with one obvious advantage: their planes don't kill people.Yet I'd still put Boeing on my list of blue-chip stocks to buy. Of course, this is a riskier contrarian play. However, because the airplane-manufacturing industry is so massive, airliners can't just willy-nilly switch producers. Basically, they have to suck it up, which like it or not benefits BA. Aflac (AFL)Source: Shutterstock I've been around the block long enough to know that the best laid plans don't always go your way. That's the primary catalyst driving stocks to buy in the insurance industry. The biggest one on most people's minds is health insurance. But contrary to common assumptions, just having basic medical coverage won't protect you from financial catastrophe. That's where Aflac (NYSE:AFL) comes in.You probably know Aflac from their comical commercials featuring the talking duck. But AFL stock and its underlying entity does serious business, specializing in supplemental insurance. Their website gives a great explanation of one of their products, demonstrating that a broken leg averages costs over $7,100. Traditional health insurance may only cover 60% of that care, leaving you on the hook for nearly $2,900.For most families, they may not have that money laying around to pay off this unexpected bill.

That's why you shouldn't overlook Aflac when considering blue-chip stocks to buy.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long T stock.

2019-05-06	2019-05-06 10:00:44	COP	ConocoPhillips	Buy ConocoPhillips Stock Following Its Beat on Earnings, Revenue	ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) fell in Wednesday and Thursday trading despite beating earnings and revenue estimates. The Houston-based oil producer beat estimates on production levels and plans to cap capital expenditures. Despite a partial recovery in Friday trading, COP stock still sells below pre-announcement levels.Source: Shutterstock However, investors may want to take a second look at this oil stock. Over time, a focused strategy, its reasonable valuation, and rising geopolitical tensions could lead to a turnaround for ConocoPhillips stock. COP Stock Fell Despite Beating on Earnings, RevenueConocoPhillips reported first-quarter earnings of $1.00 per share, just over 4% higher than the 96 cents per share the company earned in the same quarter last year. This also surpasses Wall Street estimates by 10 cents per share. The company beat on revenues as well, reporting $10.06 billion when analysts had predicted $9.16 billion. The company brought in $8.96 billion in the same quarter last year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Wednesday, COP stock initially surged higher on the news, but it ended up falling on the day by over 0.7%. Many blame higher expenses, as the company has sought to increase production. These costs have weighed on ConocoPhillips stock for more than two months.  * 7 Stocks Worth Buying When They're Down COP stock suffered last fall, as oil fell to lows of just over $42 per barrel. As oil recovered, COP rallied from its $56.75-per-share low. For a brief time in February, it surpassed $70 per share. COP trades at over $62 per share at the time of this writing.Recently, COP has expressed a goal to become profitable even if oil falls to the $40 per share range. As a result, it has put many of its non-core assets on the market. Last month, the company agreed to sell oil and gas assets in the British North Sea to Chrysaor for $2.7 billion.This transformation may have caused some concerns as the stock has sold off in recent weeks. Now, COP stock trades about 12% below the highs of mid-February. Peers such as Hess (NYSE:HES), Apache (NYSE:APA), and Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) saw similar declines. COP Stock Looks More Like a BuyConocoPhillips operates in the upstream, or exploration and production, segment of the oil industry. As such, it sees more volatility due to its sensitivity to oil prices. As mentioned earlier, the company is working to make itself profitable even when oil prices fall. For this reason, the recent drop may have created a buying opportunity. Thanks to the lower stock price, COP stock trades at at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of just 13.6.Moreover, geopolitical tensions have risen. Venezuela remains in limbo amid its economic crisis. Also, the Middle East has again become volatile as the U.S. begins a ban on Iranian oil. This has led to tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, as the Saudis increase production to fill the gap.Whatever happens between those two countries, it lessens the likelihood of low oil prices. While ConocoPhillips maintains some operations in Libya and Qatar, the firm operates primarily in more stable regions of the world. That places the firm in a position to produce oil even if the world becomes more dangerous. Final Thoughts on COP StockStrategy, valuation, and political issues in some parts of the world could finally turn COP stock around. ConocoPhillips stock fell despite beating estimates on both earnings and revenue. It has also slid in recent weeks, possibly on rising costs.  * 10 Vice Stocks to Spice Up Your Portfolio However, ConocoPhillips has focused their strategy to prosper even when oil prices fall. Also, a low PE ratio and rising political tensions in some oil-producing countries could work in the company's favor. Such pressures could become the catalyst COP stock needs to finally resume its move higher.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-06	2019-05-06 09:46:49	COP	ConocoPhillips	Recent Dip Poses Opportunity To Load-Up On Exxon Stock For The Long-Term	To put it bluntly, this is a quarter that Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and its investors may want to forget about. It truly was a mess across a variety of metrics, operations, and overall profits/revenues. It certainly wasn't the Exxon of old or just a few quarters ago. Perhaps, what's troubling is that several rivals have managed to report better numbers and make some serious strategic moves. At the same time, longer-term investors may not want to count out XOM stock.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)The recent earnings-related dip in Exxon stock has made shares the cheapest they've been in years. Meanwhile, the integrated giant still offers plenty of ways to win organically and its hefty cash, treasury stock/credit lines make M&A very well possible.In the end, Exxon's poor earnings today could be a great chance to buy the stock for the longer term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What Went Wrong At ExxonExxon Mobil's problems began in its refining segment. Turning crude oil and natural gas into gasoline and other chemicals have been a real bright spot over the last decade or so, as these refining assets have been able to feast on the lower feedstock costs. Meanwhile demand -- thanks to a growing world economy -- has been steadily rising. This created amazing margins that helped cover-up some of the issues in the exploration segment.  * 7 Stocks That Are Soaring This Earnings Season Unfortunately for Exxon, those margins and their benefits disappeared this quarter.Because of weakness in the refining segment, as well as poor price realizations for its production segment, XOM only managed to generate around $2.35 billion in profits. That's only about half of what the energy stock made in during the year-ago quarter and below analyst estimates. Likewise, revenue also took a huge hit, sinking 6.7% year-over-year. Both of these widely missed analyst expectations.To make matters potentially worse, Exxon had some trouble with its cash flows.For the quarter, XOM managed to pull in $8.3 billion in operating cash flow. Backing out expenses and other charges, free cash flow only hit $2.5 billion. That's nothing to sneeze at and most firms would be envious to realize that level of free cash flow. The only problem is that over the quarter, XOM stock holder distributions weren't covered with its free cash flow. That's not necessarily a path it wants to go down for very long.With all the negatives, it's no wonder why Exxon stock fell more than 2.2% on the news and has been drifting lower in the days since. Still Plenty Right For ExxonThere was plenty right with the quarter, as well. For one thing, Exxon is killing it on the production side of the equation. And that could be one of the biggest positives of all.Declining production was a huge problem for the major energy stocks in the early years of this decade. This included Exxon. However, XOM seems to have righted the ship, as evidenced in this latest quarter. Thanks to prolific low-cost shale production, Exxon oil production grew 5% year-over-year. That's big for an energy firm of this size. Much of that came from its 140% growth in the Permian Basin.The Permian is one of the most-expansive shale formations and features some of the best geology in the entire country. Exxon has about a 10 billion barrels worth of reserves in the region and currently has plans to expand its production to more than 1 million barrels per day by 2024. As the quarter showed, this oil still churns an operating portfolio at low prices, something that should come as a huge comfort for Exxon stock investors over the long haul.Secondly, despite its cash flow woes, Exxon still has one of the best balance sheets in the business. Today, long-term debt makes up just 9% of its capital structure. Meanwhile, the firm has nearly $225 billion in treasury stock on its balance sheet. Both of these factors make it easy for the firm to add additional debt or issue stock to fund expansion projects or even pay its dividend, something that rivals like ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) couldn't do when the oil market got tough -- sort of like it is now.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares Speaking of that dividend, Exxon did make amends with investors for its &quot;meh&quot; quarter by hiking its payout by more than 6%. That kept the streak of 37 years' worth of dividend hikes alive. Bottom Line on Exxon StockSo, yes. Exxon had a bad quarter. But the reality is, the energy giant is able to get through the malaise just fine and in the longer term, it could do very well. Perhaps the best part is that XOM stock is trading at some of its best valuations in years.The firm has a had a banner year, but the recent dip has left it dirt cheap on a number of metrics. When looking at a forward P/E, XOM clocks in at just 14x. That's much lower than the broader market and many of its rivals. Meanwhile, looking at its book value, Exxon Mobil stock today trades at near 30-year lows. Speaking of 30-year periods, Exxon's dividend yield -- currently 4.33% -- hasn't been this high since the 1990s. All of this points to one heck of a deal for longer-term investors.While the quarter was an overall bust, the longer-term growth story at Exxon -- shale production and its ability to profit in low price environments -- is still very much alive. XOM stock investors now have the ability to score it at a huge discount.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not have a position in any of the stocks mentioned.

And by 2024, according to IEA, it's projected that if the U.S. keeps up its oil export growth, it will surpass Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world top oil exporter.And the Permian Basin in Texas is leading the way.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Seven energy stocks to buy to light up your portfolio are featured below. Most are focused firms in one sector of the business; they're not the big diversified firms. This gives them even more growth potential. Energy Stocks to Buy: National Fuel Gas Co (NFG)Source: Shutterstock National Fuel Gas Co (NYSE:NFG) is a diversified natural gas company. It is not only an E&P firm, but also has storage, marketing and even utility operations.Generally you don't find a natural gas firm that does it all, unless you're looking at one of the big integrated energy firms. But NFG has been around since 1902, so it has had plenty of time to refine it business model. Most of its operations are in New York and Pennsylvania, where most of its customers are.It just reported Q1 earnings, which were in line with expectations. But the prospects for the sector are improving, and as more and more companies and consumers transition to natural gas from coal or oil (especially in NFG's service area) this will help boost demand. Also, as liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals start coming online, that will also boost business for NFG's various divisions.Its 2.9% dividend is a nice addition and its $5 billion market cap means it has a reliable business, come what may with the economy. CNOOC Ltd (CEO)Source: Shutterstock CNOOC Ltd (NYSE:CEO) is a Chinese E&P with operations all around the world.As China began to emerge as a world power, it began to expand its ability to sustain its growth. CEO was launched in 1999 and is now a major energy firm, with a nearly $80 billion market cap.Recently, its fortunes have been lackluster since the Chinese economy has been sputtering. But as recent economic numbers reveal, China's economy is recovering, and that means growing demand for energy.Also, as global demand ramps up, China will be one of the beneficiaries and that also equates to greater energy demand. Year to date the stock is up 15% and it delivers a 5%-plus dividend on top of that.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May It recently signed a deal with the Russians to drill for and transport natural gas from a Russian site in the Arctic. And also formed a JV with PetroChina (NYSE:PTR) to drill in the South China Sea. Black Stone Minerals LP (BSM)Source: Shutterstock Black Stone Minerals LP (NYSE:BSM) is in the minerals and royalty business. This is kind of like a real estate investment trust (REIT) for energy and minerals.Basically BSM buys properties -- it has properties in over 40 states -- and then leases them to E&P firms to develop and takes a royalty for the minerals (including oil and gas) taken from the properties.This means it doesn't have to spend a lot of money on all the manpower and equipment to explore for the oil, it's merely a landlord. And it's set up as a limited partnership, so investors are also part of the ownership and get paid their share of net income as a dividend payment. Right now, that dividend is paying out more than 8%.As this energy boom heats up in the U.S., demand for quality properties that aren't already bid to the moon to explore will increase. Because BSM has been acquiring properties for quite a while, it's now enjoying the fruits of decades-long labor.This can be a cyclical industry, and right now, BSM's time is arriving. It's also a tempting acquisition for larger integrated energy firms. ConocoPhillips (COP)Source: Shutterstock ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is the largest E&P company operating today. With operations all around the world, it has diversified its portfolio to take advantage of any inefficiencies in the market.The old saying &quot;make hay while the sun shines&quot; is especially appropriate for upstream firms today, as oil prices rise. This is their time, and it's no surprise that ConocoPhillips is looking to increase production 5% this year.A strong global economy means widespread demand increases for COP's customers.It recently reported Q1 earnings that beat expectations. Q4 was a stronger quarter for COP, but Q1 earnings this year still beat Q1 from last year, which is encouraging. Plus, energy prices are on the move so far in 2019, and that trend is likely to stay in place. Even if energy prices stay flat from here that will be good for COP.  * 7 Stocks That Are Soaring This Earnings Season Its dividend comes in just under 2%, but with a $70 billion market cap, this is a blue-chip E&P that will deliver during an upcycle, but won't be a heart-stopping ride compared to smaller E&Ps. Chesapeake Energy (CHK)Source:  Philadelphia 76ers Via FlickrChesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) was started by Tom Ward and the larger than life Aubrey McClendon. The latter also was part owner of the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder, which he brought to his home city from Seattle.Chesapeake was founded when both owners were in their late 20s, and they were some of the first people to take on unconventional drilling at their fledgling E&P firm. And as an MLP in the heyday of MLPs, CHK stock was a high-flier.But those days transitioned into a much tougher energy market and structural issues regarding MLPs and CHK business operations in general. When McClendon unexpectedly died in 2016, it also marked a slow decline in CHK stock's fortunes.But the company has endured and is now at bargain prices as oil and natural gas prices continue to rise. The stock is up 32% year to date. And given the consolidation in the upstream sector, this is a potential takeover candidate at this point. Berry Petroleum (BRY)Source: Shutterstock Berry Petroleum (NYSE:BRY) is a unique E&P firm in the sense that it primarily focuses its efforts in California and Utah. While there's plenty of talk about the shales in Texas, Montana and the Appalachians, Berry has the West.But there is a lot of oil and natural gas in California. It's just that the state has been more regulated about extraction techniques and that has made it tough to drill freely.Recent legislation has passed to alleviate some of the regulatory hurdles, and that has been to the great benefit of BRY. The stock is up nearly 32% in the past year, which shows that it has been a strong grower, even when prices collapsed at the end of 2018.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares Now, it's a much brighter picture and this would surely be a great acquisition at a premium. It will also continue to succeed on its own as well. And the 4.3% dividend is also a nice kicker. Cabot Oil & Gas (COG)Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG) an E&P firm that primarily focuses on the Marcellus Shale that runs from New York to Tennessee. COG concentrates most of its efforts in Pennsylvania.This is one of the most productive shales in the U.S., but its geography is a bit more challenging than the shales in west Texas like the Permian Basin. But that being said, there is plenty of opportunity and COG stock is taking full advantage.The stock has a slim 1.4% dividend, but the real opportunity here is rising energy prices and a decent sized company that is leverage to that price growth. Add to that the consolidation in the E&P sector right now and you have a good stock priced very well for the growth that is coming over the next quarters.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-05-02	2019-05-02 11:21:43	COP	ConocoPhillips	3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: Cisco Systems, ConocoPhillips and Brighthouse Financial	What started out as another record-breaking day for the market ended on a sour note. Already feeling the weight of incredible gains, the wrong interest rate rhetoric from Fed chief Jerome Powell sent the S&P 500 to a close of 2,923.73, down 0.75% from Tuesday's final trade.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) set the tone, and pace, for that pullback, losing 3.0% following a Q1 earnings report that was better than what analysts were expecting, but it still failed to fully satisfy traders' unspoken expectations. Molson Coors Brewing (NYSE:TAP) fell more than 7% after missing its first-quarter forecasts.There were a handful of winners. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of them, jumping nearly 5% in response to a quarterly earnings report that topped relatively low expectations. Sales, as well as unit sales of the iPhone, were down year-over-year, but investors were and still are optimistic about the potential of its services business.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May None are great trading prospects headed into Thursday's session though. Rather, it's stock charts of Brighthouse Financial (NASDAQ:BHF), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) that are shaping up as your best bets. Here's what's happening, and what has to happen next. Cisco Systems (CSCO)The tone and timbre of Cisco Systems changed late last month, by virtue of a move out of a well-established uptrend and into a sideways rut. CSCO isn't in an irreversible downtrend just yet. But, as of yesterday's action, it's one bad day away from falling into more serious trouble.Just as bad, there's a ton of room and reason for Cisco to slide lower if the bears can deliver just one more decent blow. The stage is already set.  Click to Enlarge  * The make-or-break line is around $55.40, plotted in red on the daily chart. Cisco has found a low near the first three days of this week.  * CSCO shares are certainly ripe for some selling. The stock is now 16.7% above its white 200-day moving average line, which is about as much divergence as shares have demonstrated in the past.  * Fanning the flames of a potential pullback is the weekly chart's RSI indicator now being in bullish territory above the 70 level. Brighthouse Financial (BHF)Brighthouse Financial isn't exactly a household name. Not only is its $4.9 billion market cap just not enough weight to garner much in the way of media attention, but the company has also only been a publicly traded entity since the middle of 2017, when it was spun off from Metlife. It didn't get started on a great foot either, falling out of the gate, and then continuing to fall through late last year.The past few months have been distinctly different though, and decidedly better. They've been so good, in fact, that the stock is one step away from kicking off a self-fueled rally supported by an oddly low valuation.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Are Worth Your Money   Click to Enlarge  * Last month, BHF pushed its way back above the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. This instance looks like it's going to stick.  * As of this week, the purple 50-day average has crossed above the aforementioned 200-day line. This event, highlighted in blue, is called a golden cross and generally portends the beginning of a bigger rally.  * The volume since the turn in January has been leaning bullishly, as suggested by the fact that the weekly chart's Chaikin line is above zero, and still rising.  * The last line to watch is the resistance line that tags all the peaks since October. That technical ceiling is plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts. ConocoPhillips (COP)When we last looked at ConocoPhillips a week ago, it had just broken below a key technical support level, but it had been meeting increasingly tough resistance for several weeks. The stock followed through on that rekindled downtrend that very day. But, it was a flawed follow-through in that it left behind a gap that needed to be filled.Sure enough, the stock bounced, closing the gap yesterday. The stock may well be back in serious trouble again though, given the shape of Wednesday's bar and the backdrop of that move.  Click to Enlarge  * The gap is highlighted on the daily chart. Yesterday's high of $64.53 filled the gap, but the sellers tore right back in to close near the low for the day. That's a sign that the mode remains net-bearish.  * Bolstering the bearish case is the degree of volume behind Wednesday's rollover. But, that wasn't exactly a shocking development. Bearish volume has been above average and growing since mid-April.  * For better or worse, ConocoPhillips is still being pushed around by the sentiment surrounding oil and natural gas prices. COP can't be traded entirely in a vacuum.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-01	2019-05-01 14:16:25	COP	ConocoPhillips	Is ConocoPhillips Stock in the M&A Hot Seat?	ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a big energy exploration and production (E&P) player around the world. This is also referred to as the upstream part of the oil business. And right now, things look good for upstream stocks like COP stock.Source: Shutterstock Midstream players are the pipeline and distribution companies. Downstream players are the refiners, wholesalers and retailers. The big integrated oil companies do it all -- from upstream to downstream. Other firms work their niche.The upstream players generally have the biggest risk-reward ratio since they are very price sensitive to the price of oil and natural gas, and they have to risk getting the balance right between exploring for more opportunities and producing from active wells.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo far, 2019 looks very bullish for energy prices from an energy company perspective. COP as an Upstream M&A TargetIt's also easily witnessed in the battle that has begun for E&P Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC) by fellow E&P player Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE: OXY) and integrated oil firm Chevron Corp (NYSE: CVX). OXY boosted its offer for APC 20% higher than CVX's current bid.  * 7 Stocks That Are Soaring This Earnings Season COP is the biggest global E&P player at this point, according to GuruFocus.com. If OXY and APC merged that would strip COP stock of that title.On the other hand, CVX is the second largest integrated oil and adding APC would bolster its position in the upstream oil sector.Regardless how this plays out, the point is, big energy companies are looking to consolidate the industry and have the money to do it. And given the amount that this battle is going to cost the winner, it's likely the loser may want to turn its sights to COP next.At this point, COP is producing from its current sites around the world, having just recently sold 2 properties in the UK for $2.7 billion. It doesn't expect to amp up production in the near term, but is strengthening its current portfolio and using some of the proceeds to fund its stock buyback program. This may prove to be a smart move if prices drop as quickly as they have risen, or if the dollar loses strength.You see, since oil is priced in dollars, a strong dollar boosts oil prices, and vice versa.However, if the rally keeps its legs under it, COP could miss out on the opportunity to sell more oil and gas into a rising market, boosting earnings and expanding margins.This is part of the risk of being in the E&P sector. But bear in mind, COP has been around long enough to see this game played out before. And in 2002, Conoco merged with Phillips Petroleum to build this firm, selling off its downstream assets in 2012.COP is in a great position regardless if there's a merger in its future or if it continues to operate under its own steam. And that's why my Portfolio Grader gives COP stock a B rating.It's a rock solid upstream choice that may seem some increased interest in the near future. But even if it keeps chugging along, it's a reliable energy pick in a growing global economy.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

In the biggest reversal of fortune for the commodity since it rebounded from its 2016 crash, oil has surged about 50 percent from the 52-week lows it set back late in December.  Now, thanks in part to production cuts from members of OPEC, Brent Crude is priced above a solid $70 level, and OPEC claims it doesn't plan on ramping up production until it reaches the $80 level it last hit back in October of 2018.  As a result, equities correlated to energy prices have seen decent growth through the first few months of 2019, with the likes of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) up 17 percent and Schlumberger Limited (NYSE: SLB) up an impressive 20 percent on the year.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/headline-edge-surge-oil-price-161816757.html?.tsrc=rss

The direction of the market's undertow, if there is one, remains unclear.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)3M (NYSE:MMM) did more damage than any other name, falling nearly 13% after reporting disappointing first-quarter numbers and ultimately deciding to cull 2000 jobs to adjust for a poor outlook. Nokia (NYSE:NOK) wasn't far behind with more than an 8% stumble though, after swinging to a surprising first-quarter loss.There were some winners, though not as many, and no major names made meaningful gains. New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV) jumped more than 5% yesterday on news surrounding its new Marley-branded CBD drink, but NBEV shares gave back more than 2% in yesterday's after-hours trading.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Automation Stocks to Buy for the 21st Century None of them are great trading prospects headed into the final trading day of the week though. Rather, it's the stock charts of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) that have earned closer looks. ConocoPhillips (COP)Back on April 12, ConocoPhillips was put under the trading microscope as a potentially bearish candidate. A major floor was being tested, repeatedly, but more than that COP stock was logging more lower highs thanks to increasing resistance at key moving average lines. Most noteworthy of all was that ConocoPhillips was being left out of a rally most other energy names were enjoying.As of Wednesday, that support line has been snapped. As of Thursday, the bears put some distance between that floor and COP stock.  Click to Enlarge  * The big line in the sand is right at $65, plotted with a red dashed line on both stock charts. Although shares had been lower since that floor was defined, that's the low that has been found the most since the middle of last year.  * Bolstering the bearish tide is the volume behind it. The weekly chart's Chaikin line has already crossed below zero, which tends to be a good signal of a sizeable pullback.  * It's subtle, to the point of being mostly overlooked. But, as of Thursday's action, all four key moving average lines are sloped downward, pointing to the depth of the bearish momentum now in place. MGM Resorts International (MGM)In January, MGM Resorts popped out of a well-defined downtrend. Although the effort continued to get traction for a few more days, that move was ultimately unwound -- and then some -- in February and March.The bulls appear to have regrouped since then, pushing the stock back above all the key moving average lines. It's this second effort, in fact, that largely seals the deal on the bigger rebound effort. The key is the interplay of those moving averages.  * 5 Cheap Energy Stocks to Buy Under $10   Click to Enlarge  * This week's triggering event is the move back above the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts.  * Also, take note of the way the moving average lines are starting to converge again after a big bearish divergence last year. The impending bullish crosses of those moving average lines are buying triggers in and of themselves.  * The clincher for the budding rebound effort would be a break above $27.96, plotted with a red dashed line on the daily chart. That's where MGM has peaked a couple of times since last week.  * Although compelling, the budding renewal of the breakout so far lacks volume. If the volume is still light after any move above $28, close caution remains advised. AbbVie (ABBV)With just a quick glance, AbbVie looks like it's in serious trouble. Shares have been trending steadily lower since April, and are within easy reach of new 52-week lows … again.ABBV stock may be better positioned for a rebound than it seems on the surface, however. While there's still some significant work that needs to be done to snap AbbVie out of its bearish rut, a great deal of the needed hard work has already been done.  Click to Enlarge  * The game-changer here is the horizontal support that has developed around $77 over the course of the past few months. That floor is plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts.  * Curiously, although it has not helped make much forward progress, the past three days have not only been bullish, they've been on above-average volume. The bulls may be testing the waters.  * From here, ABBV will need to hurdle the falling resistance line that tags all the key highs going back to May of last year. That line is plotted in light blue on both stock charts, and currently rests at $85.60.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-25	2019-04-25 14:14:38	COP	ConocoPhillips	Occidental Petroleum Fires Back at Chevron, Starting a Bidding War for Anadarko	High margins and a huge footprint were the reasons behind energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) finally pulling the trigger and buying independent rival Anadarko (NYSE:APC) last week. The deal seemed to be a match made in heaven for CVX stock and its investors. It had everything that Chevron could want. And APC stock investors were also smiling after a few years of scraping by. Yep, everything seemed to be going just right for CVX.Source: Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement via FlickrThat is, until another buyer stepped up to the plate.It turns out that Anadarko would be a great fit for another integrated oil giant. No, not Exxon (NYSE:XOM). We're talking about often-forgotten Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). For OXY, Anadarko represents a chance for it to finally join the supermajors and gain access to even more land in its core areas.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor Chevron, the booming buyout battle represents a major headache as it'll be forced to step even further up to the plate. Chevron Gets OverbidAs we said, Anadarko features plenty of assets that fit under Chevron's umbrella perfectly. The key to CVX's $33 billion bid and 39% premium is the prolific Permian Basin. The Permian continues to be the hotbed of drilling activity in the U.S. as its geology makes it wonderful for fracking and horizontal drilling. Thanks to its low-costs, high-margins and abundance of oil, the Permian has cemented itself as the place to be in America's shale.  * 7 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Over the Next Five Years Both Anadarko and Chevron have been very active in the Permian and the deal would connect their acreage together -- with CVX controlling more than 1.4 million net acres. The synergies write themselves.But Chevron isn't the only one with massive holdings in the Permian. OXY isn't no slouch either. The firm is one of the largest acreage owners, holding about 2.7 million net acres in the region. It produces about 10% of the Permian's total oil production. All in all, the Permian represented about 57% of OXY's total production last year.Anadarko would represent a great addition to OXY's overall system in the area.For starters, APC's production would boost Occidental's overall output to more than 1.5 million barrels per day. This would instantly push OXY to the top chunk of the E&P pack. For example, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) only produces about 1.3 million barrels per day. And there's an opportunity to boost that further with Occidental's expertise of enhanced oil recovery/CO2 injection in the area. Analysts peg that OXY could pull a potential to 1 million barrels per day from APC's assets by the late 2020s.Secondly, like with Chevron, Anadarko's assets would represent a chance to pull costs lower and improve margins. This includes APC's midstream assets -- which OXY pays to use already. The cost savings alone would help OXY's bottom line. Occidental estimates that the buyout can increase free cash flow by $3.5 billion over the next two years through these synergies and CAPEX reductions.Finally, many of Anadarko's other assets -- such as global deepwater and liquefied natural gas -- would represent new areas of operation for Occidental. However, OXY has a rich global portfolio and can spin-off/sell these non-core items to help pay for the deal and bring in extra cash.All in all, OXY and APC makes as much sense as the combination for Chevron. So, it's no wonder why OXY topped Chevron's bid by about $11 per share. Chevron Will Need To Buckle DownFor Chevron, this poses a big problem. As we said, it takes a take boost in production to move the needle at such a giant energy stock. And with production flatlining for most the majors, CVX has to buy someone the size of Anadarko to make a real dent in its production issues. And the assets here are just perfectly matched to suit CVX's needs.That means CVX is going to be forced to up its bid in order to get what it wants.Chevron has deep pockets, so scoring APC won't be a problem. But it's going to have to cough up plenty of extra cash to do so. Analysts estimate that CVX will need to add between $5 to $10 per share to its bid just to have a chance to score Anadarko. But that still might be enough as APC shares have traded above the price OXY is willing to offer. Meanwhile, Occidental has hinted that it will challenge the buyout if Chevron wins and their offer isn't marginally better.All of this could hinder the appeal of the deal for Chevron. The original buyout is already large. Tacking on extra cash and shares to sweeten the pot could hurt some of the synergies and benefits as well as stretch out the time until the deal truly pays off. That's something to consider. Chevron? OXY? The Real Winner Is AnadarkoBidding wars like this in the energy sector are very rare. In fact, they never happen. So, it'll be interesting to see how this plays out. Both OXY and Chevron are moving into unknown territory and the costs to play could be high. The real winner in this situation could be Anadarko.After suffering for a few years, APC stock is on fire because of the buyout potential. And no matter who buys it out, the premium is certainly nice for shareholders. And we can't forget about the other majors like Exxon who could make the love triangle a foursome.  * 5 Hot Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Weather Heats Up In the end, APC stock could be the way to play the most exciting M&A opportunity in the energy patch in a long time.

These are companies like Extraction Oil & Gas (NYSE:XOG) and Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN).What they have in common are steady production and balance sheets that let them put their new gains into something other than paying back old debt. If they can buy their own stock instead, it can float upward and that gives them a currency with which to do new deals.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Speculators WinThis has been a play for speculators, not investors, because if you were buying and holding these stocks over the last year or two, you're wondering what the excitement is about.Take Extraction Oil as an example. This stock is up 30% since the start of the year. Much of that gain has been achieved in just the last week, before April 23, as the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the primary U.S. grade, has gone from $60 per barrel to $65.  * 10 Oversold Stocks to Run From Extraction has had been profitable since last spring, but its balance sheet still shows $1.4 billion in debt, against a market cap of $946 million, when the stock opened for trade April 23. Over the last year, it is down 60%. It's only this month that it has started to pay off.Devon is in much better financial shape. It remained profitable during the worst of the oil bust, which started in 2014, reporting 2018 net income of $1.14 billion. The balance sheet shows debts of just $5.8 billion on a market cap of $15.4 billion.Yet if you have been in this name for a year, you have just broken even, and over two years, the return is a negative 10%. The dividend, currently at 9 cents per share, a yield of 1.14%, doesn't make up that loss. What you needed to do was time your trade to the start of the year. If you bought early in January, you have a gain of over 50% in Devon.This is a game for traders and speculators, not investors.What the small fry hope for is a bailout, from a major oil stocks player like Chevron (NYSE:CVX).Chevron recently announced it will buy Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) for $33 billion. Or try Conoco Philips (NYSE:COP), which has sold assets to firm up its balance sheet. It could now buy back stock or a smaller domestic producer. Analysts are pounding the table for these stocks.But what they're pushing are sellers, not buyers. Conoco Philips has been a net seller of assets. Anadarko is trading above the Chevron bid because Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) may still launch a hostile bid for the company.In any case, what analysts are praying for is consolidation. Fewer players, more concentrated in the Permian, could become &quot;swing producers&quot; that can hold prices steady, and increase production when the market is tight, limiting it when the market is glutted. The Bottom Line on Oil StocksIran is going to come back online. Venezuela is going to come back online. Huge new pools of oil, like the one Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has found off Guyana, are going to come online.Production will rise, and demand will fall, because there are now alternatives to oil in the market. Efficiency, technology, and renewable energy are still the market drivers. The Permian &quot;control&quot; of the market has a sell-by date, and you don't want to be long when it comes.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Reuters had reported on Wednesday that Chrysaor and Conoco were close to sealing the deal, citing sources close to the process who put the value of the assets at up to $2.8 billion.  The North Sea has undergone a major transformation in recent years, as long-standing producers have sold assets to smaller players such as Chrysaor who say they can squeeze more money out of fields due to their nimbler operations.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conoco-sells-uk-north-sea-122009397.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-04-12	2019-04-12 11:36:32	COP	ConocoPhillips	3 Big Stock Charts for Friday: ConocoPhillips, Caterpillar and Morgan Stanley	Stocks were back and forth all day on Thursday, and by the time the closing bell rang, the game ended in a tie. The S&P 500 only mustered an 0.11 point gain yesterday, which wasn't even enough to register a percentage change. Underscoring the lack of conviction behind the action is the fact that yesterday's was the lowest-volume day in months.Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) wasn't fazed by the broad lethargy. Its budding recovery effort was bolstered by whispers that it would soon be putting itself up for sale, sparking a 3.9% advance. At the other end of the spectrum, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) fell 4.3% on the heels of growing political uncertainty regarding the future healthcare. Thursday's jaw-dropper was the 10% tumble Weight Watchers (NASDAQ:WTW), now called WW, took after JPMorgan analyst Christina Brathwaite rang the alarm bells about the company even louder than she had been.Headed into the week's final trading session, the stock charts of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) are worth the closest looks. Here's why, and what's about to happen.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips ConocoPhillips (COP)Most oil stocks are doing reasonably well, catching a tailwind driven by the rising price of oil. That dynamic, however, hasn't applied universally. The oil names that aren't being picked up by that rising tide stand out -- and do so for the wrong reason.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives ConocoPhillips is one of those names, and worse, is knocking on the door of a major breakdown. One more poor day could push COP over the edge.  Click to Enlarge • The line to watch is right at $65, plotted with a red dashed line on the daily chart. That's where ConocoPhillips has made lows since February, and where it found support before the December drubbing.• There may be even more to that technical floor than readily meets the eye. Plotting Fibonacci retracement lines from the well-established floor at $42 from 2017, the $65.60 area is also a key 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line. Notice the other Fibonacci line at $56.60 has also been a key support level.• It's subtle, and perhaps means little. But, yesterday's small pullback took shape on huge volume. There could be a lot of sellers just waiting in the wings for a triggering event. Caterpillar (CAT)Last year was a tough one for Caterpillar, and by extension, for CAT shareholders. After a fantastic 2017 that served up promise of a major earnings revival, fears of rising steel prices and a tariff war put Caterpillar shares back in a downtrend. From its January-2018 peak near $173 to October's low of $112, CAT stock lost a total of 35% from high to low.Over the course of the past few months, however, we've seen hints that the downtrend has been snapped. The new uptrend isn't fully formed yet, but the lines in the sand are very well defined.  Click to Enlarge • The key from here is getting above $142.80, where Caterpillar peaked a couple of times since October's capitulatory low. That resistance level is plotted in yellow on both stock charts.• At the same time, since October's bottom, the bulls have managed to form a clear rising support line, plotted in red on both stock charts.• While a move above $142.80 is still the make-or-break event, the possibility of that happening is bolstered by the golden cross that formed on Thursday. That's where the purple 50-day moving average line crosses above the white 200-day line. Morgan Stanley (MS)When we last looked at Morgan Stanley back on April 5, we were impressed by the breakout thrust that attacked the 200-day moving average line, but were concerned about a gap that had been left behind in the process. It was a perfect setup for the bears to push back.And they did, as would be expected with any fresh encounter with a major moving average line. It's what happened in the meantime and what's about to happen that makes MS worth a refreshed look.  Click to Enlarge • Morgan Stanley danced with the 200-day moving average line for a day, but slipped back under it. That slide, however, was just enough to almost close the gap that had been left behind on the April 3.• At the same time, the technical ceiling around $45, marked with a yellow dashed line on both charts, still stands and augments the potential resistance made by the 200-day moving average line.• Though not yet over that one last hump, if Morgan Stanley shares can clear that line, there's little left to hold a rally back.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

In March 2016, BP agreed with China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) to explore and produce natural gas from shale rock formations in the Neijiang-Dazu block in Sichuan, its first such contract in China.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-latest-oil-major-exit-095844426.html?.tsrc=rss

2019-04-02	2019-04-02 11:38:36	COP	ConocoPhillips	ECA Stock Is Right Where It Needs to Be as Oil Prices Start Rising	After weeks of stagnation, Encana (NYSE:ECA) is poised for bigger things. The Canadian exploration and production company completed its purchase of Newfield Exploration in February. ECA stock could finally see a move higher for a couple of reasons.Source: Shutterstock This makes Encana the second-largest producer of unconventional resources in North America. More important, the company also appears poised to benefit from rising oil prices.Due to the increasing value of its unconventional energy, Encana stock looks poised to drill for increasing value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The Elite 8 Stocks to Buy for Massive Outperformance  ECA Stock and an Oil-Focussed ApproachBased in Calgary, Alberta, Encana owns key assets in the Duvernay and Montney resources in the Canadian Rockies. ECA also benefits from substantial holdings in Texas's Permian Basin and Eagle Ford shales.Now, the Newfield deal brings access to fields in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma. Moreover, much like its embattled peer Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), it moves to decrease its dependence on natural gas. Thanks to the assets from Newfield, liquids will now make up more than 50% of the company's total production.ECA also has moved to enhance its financial stability. It has paid down more than half of the debt it had built up from the energy boom in the early part of the decade.Holding $3.7 billion in long-term debt may look heavy compared to its $7.45 billion in stockholders' equity. Still, it compares well to close competitors such as Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) and larger peers such as ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) The Encana RecoverySince hitting lows in 2016, revenues have trended higher every year. The company returned to profitability in 2017. Despite falling back this year, analysts expect profit growth to resume next year. On average, Wall Street forecasts 12.52% earnings growth per year over the next five years for ECA. And this stands despite a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of only 7.6.In some respects, one can understand the low multiple. Encana operates in the volatile upstream oil market. Exploration and production companies depend on higher oil prices to remain profitable. Hence, ECA and its peers will likely take a hit if another oil price slump occurs.Indeed, the oil price slump of late last year took the stock from the $13 per share level to as low as $5 per share by late December. It quickly recovered to the $7 per share level by mid-January. However, ECA has seen little movement since then. OPEC and ECA stockThat could change. Due to the Newfield deal, Encana raised its dividend from 1.5 cents to 1.9 cents per share every quarter. Moreover, ECA shareholders appear positioned to receive a much larger &quot;payout&quot; thanks to OPEC.As oil prices go so goes upstream oil stocks. This becomes even more true for ECA as the production of liquids becomes increasingly important. Members of OPEC and ten non-OPEC countries instituted production cuts in early January. This had led to a substantial turnaround.WTI Crude briefly traded below $43 per barrel in late December. Now with the reductions, prices have rebounded above $60 per barrel. If the market can sustain or exceed that price point on oil, ECA &#92;will probably receive the boost it needs to return to double-digit price levels. Final Thoughts on ECA StockDue to a de facto status as a proxy for oil price, ECA stock should rise along with these prices. The recent purchase of Newfield makes Encana more of an oil than a natural gas company.For this reason, it stands to benefit more from rising oil prices than it had in the past. Now, with the OPEC-led production costs pushing oil prices higher, its drilling activity should lead to more profits.As things stand now, the production cut will only hold until the end of June. Admittedly, if production cuts end and prices fall back, the near-term investment prospects could fall apart. Still, for at least the next three months, investors should like what they see from ECA stock.As of this writing, Will Healy is long CHK stock. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

Neil George's pick for the contest is Viper Energy Partners (NASDAQ:VNOM).The InvestorPlace stock picking contest for 2019 is a showcase of ideas from the collection of editors and contributors. And it also demonstrates the process each different person uses to come up with a company.My recommendation is for Viper Energy Partners (NASDAQ:VNOM), which year to date is up in price by 27.7%. And with its dividend yielding 6.1%, the total return to date is over 29%. This compares to the price gain of the S&P 500 Index of 12.8% and a total return of 13.4%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsViper Energy Compared to the S&P 500 Index Total Return Source BloombergThis contest isn't about throwing darts but showcasing how ideas are generated and why. And in the process, throughout the rest of the year, you'll get a better feel for how each of us work.At Profitable Investing, one of my core mechanisms for finding the best stocks for growth and income is finding economic, market or even social or political developments that will spur more demand for specific goods and services.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business I do this by consuming a great deal of news from numerous daily papers, constant streaming of BBC World Service and Bloomberg Television, subscribing to many industry and professional journals and, of course, being glued to my Bloomberg Terminal with all of its analytical and data tools.When I find some developments that support more demand, I drill down and find the companies that are best focused to capitalize on that pending new demand. Then I identify the leaders and vet them to find the best of the best. I go through those to determine which will be sales growth leaders while watching for those with the best and most improving margins. After that, I ask what will go wrong to dampen future sales or result in higher costs. And I run what ifs to see how they will cope with challenges. And finally, I put my banker hat on and look at the debts of the companies.At the end of this process I determine if I would lend to this company. And if not, then I have no business recommending it as a buy for you.Viper Energy ticks all the boxes in a market with positive developments. And as a landlord of the petroleum market -- it is a unique company in that it doesn't drill or operate oil and gas equipment -- only collecting lease income and royalty payments.Read on to see how and why I recommend the company and its stock. Petrol is PowerfulPetrol is a big part of the U.S. and global economy, and that's why we have a collection of up, down and midstream petroleum companies inside the model portfolios of Profitable Investing. And like most market segments, the market for petroleum and the underlying companies and their stocks never moves in a continuous straight line.But as I've been writing in Profitable Investing this year and over the past year, there are some major overriding developments that favor profitability for US petroleum companies. And to start, all it takes is to look at price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. Since 2016, the market for U.S. crude oil has gone from a low of $35.70 to a current level of $60.01 a barrel for a gain of 68.1%.US WTI Crude Oil Price Source BloombergThe price, of course, was higher in October, but with the sell-off in the general stock market, oil slipped to a near term low on Dec. 24 -- corresponding to the lows in many of the stock market indexes.But like for stocks, the realities of a growing U.S. economy and profitability of U.S. oil companies at even lower crude prices has been supporting the underlying market. And note, as I've written, the much lower crude oil prices five years and more ago worked to drive U.S. producers and related companies to increase technology in the fields to drive down lift costs for crude. This means that U.S. companies can pump crude at lower costs so that margins at sale can be positive even with lower market prices.This had been leading to a continued upward march in U.S. production, which since 2016 has soared by more than 33%.US Crude Oil Production Keeps Climbing Source BloombergAnd according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), this continued climb in production should result in that the US will be a net oil exporter by 2021.Adding to the positive market developments are that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries plus Russia and other nations (OPEC+) continue to largely adhere to production cuts, resulting in the proven data from shipping records of December 2018 showing production cuts of 1.2 million barrels per day (MBPD), with only Russia and Iraq showing some slippage in their cuts. More Crude on the MoveWhat has been a limitation for U.S. crude has been domestic stockpiles of stored crude. One of the big limitations has been the infrastructure to move crude to refineries and marine terminals for export. But as I've been writing, the approval process for additional pipeline capacity has been stepped up with pipeline companies continuing to add capacity to move stuck crude to the market.This now is showing up with the dramatic drop in U.S. stockpiles of crude as tracked by the EIA. The stockpiles are now down to lows not seen since last June and may well head lower with the further developments in transportation.US Crude Stockpiles Down West Texas WTI Up Source EIA, BloombergThis drawdown in stockpiles is showing up in the export market. And what is particularly interesting is how much more U.S. crude is being shipped to Europe. Over the past five years, U.S. crude exports have gone from zero to nearly 1.4 billion barrels according to records from the U.S. Census Department.US Crude Exports to Europe Source US Census, BloombergThis surge in U.S. crude in Europe is now driving the price of European crude prices. For North Sea crude prices set at ports in the Netherlands, Argus Media (Private), a business intelligence analytics company, is stating that one third of the time, U.S. crude imports in Europe are driving the prices for European crude oil.That puts U.S. producers further on the way to narrowing the price discount of WTI in the U.S. to the higher Brent crude prices. And this in turn, should help to increase the margins for U.S. producers and related companies. Globe Takes More than MakesNow, OPEC+ isn't going to limit production forever. However, there are some reasons to see limits in their capacity to bring significantly more crude oil to the market. First, Iran remains under U.S. sanctions with no daylight in negotiations in sight. And waivers are running out, particularly with more availability of U.S.-exported oil such as what is now surging to Europe and noted above.In addition, even if other major former producers get sorted out politically -- they will take years to get back into the oil business. This includes the imploding nation of Venezuela, the broken-apart Libya as well as the very unsettled West African nations including Nigeria.Second, as I wrote in the September Issue, Saudi Arabia and Russia are both post peak in production with the major fields in Saudi Arabia being drained with dropping reserves.Meanwhile, the globe's demand for crude oil remains firmly on the ascent. And even with rising U.S. production and exports, there continues to be shortfalls in supply against global consumption of crude oil. The EIA tracks overall supply and consumption and as the graph shows -- consumption keeps peaking over supply on an ongoing basis over the past many years.And add in the U.S. drop in stockpiles -- and the supply and demand statistics favor supported crude oil prices.Global Oil Supply (White) Global Oil Consumption (Gold) Source EIA Bloomberg My Permian PlayThere are many companies, from upstream producers through midstream pipelines and downstream refiners, that are benefiting from the petroleum market developments that are underway.But the company that is right at the source of all of this additional U.S. production of oil and gas is Viper Energy, which I hold in one of the model portfolios of Profitable Investing.Viper Energy is the leading landlord of the petroleum patch primarily in the Permian Basin which is at the center of the shale oil development in the U.S. market. As a landlord, the company doesn't drill or operate a single well -- but instead, leases out its land for exploration and development companies (E&P) for fee income and royalties on the oil and gas that gets pumped out of its land.This means little capital is needed beyond the land. And it means that the company doesn't have to worry as much about the price fluctuations in oil and gas for its operations. But of course, the higher the price of crude and the higher the price for natural gas -- the higher in royalties and the higher the income.It has a large collection of operators on its land including Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), BP (NYSE:BP), XTO Energy, EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) and many others. Each and all continue to develop leased properties.Since coming to the public market in 2014 through a drop-down of assets from Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) in which it took land assets and set up Viper to manage and own the properties while taking and keeping an ownership stake in the company, the proven developed reserves of petroleum have climbed by 764%. And royalty income per acre of its land has grown by 368%.Overall oil and gas produced on Viper's land was up 63% in 2018. And the company is projecting that on an organic basis (meaning existing land statistics and not counting additional land and land development that production will climb at least by 24% for 2019.In addition, Viper completed an extra share sale this year. That additional cash is going to expand its land properties. And with Diamondback having much more land it its existing assets -- there is more room for a further drop down for more productive petroleum land in its portfolio. This will mean more growth potential for leases and royalty income. Venom Stock for Better ReturnsTotal Return for Viper Energy Source BloombergViper Energy has been a good performer. Over the trailing year, the stock has generated a total return of over 58%, including its ample and rising dividend. And this even includes the slip with the general stock market in the fourth quarter of last year.But since Dec. 24, 2018 to date, Viper has soared by 46% reflecting the realities of the economy and the market for high and rising royalty income from its leased lands. VNOM Stock by the NumbersViper, as noted above, is working well as a landlord. Revenues for the trailing year are up by 67.90%. And since it doesn't drill or pump oil -- its operating margin is a whopping 70.30%. This in turn drives a great return on shareholders' equity of 20.60%. It has gobs of cash and its debts are at a minimal 24.8% of its valuable assets so its credit is very good.Then we come to that nice dividend. The current distribution is at 51 cents which has been climbing over the last three years by an average annual gain of 37.32%. That distribution equates to a yield of 6.19%. And in recent tax filings, even though Viper changed from a passthrough to a taxable entity effective on May 10, 2018 the dividends paid on  August 20 and November 19, 2018 have been deemed as return of capital.The stock has been performing and paying well. And yet, the shares are reasonably valued with a price to book at nearly 3.19 times. This is down from over 4.5 times book seen earlier last year. And more important, the underlying book value per share has climbed over the past year by 36.36% meaning that the underlying value of the book of assets is up and growing and not just the stock price.Now that the additional shares have been placed in the market successfully, the stock makes for a continued good buy for growth and income under $38.00 per share.Neil George is the editor of Profitable Investing and does not have any holdings in the securities mentioned above.

2019-02-07	2019-02-07 19:17:44	COP	ConocoPhillips	Chesapeake Stock Still Is a Top Way to Play an Oil, Gas Rebound	In late October, yours truly here touted Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) as an underestimated turnaround prospect. Chesapeake stock promptly fell from that day's close of $4.54 to a Dec. 24 close of $1.73, confirming that I am neither clairvoyant nor infallible.  Click to Enlarge Source:  Philadelphia 76ers Via Flickr Since then, Chesapeake stock has made its way back to its current price near $2.60. Most investors also fully recognize the steep selloff was due to a combination of major market-wide selloff and a meltdown in crude and natural gas prices. The company didn't unexpectedly hit a wall. Still, nothing undercuts a stock's future like broken confidence.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond Chesapeake Energy is a name I'm standing by though. While it's fighting an uphill battle of weak commodity prices, it remains the best-of-breed pick within the exploration and production arena.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A Closer Look at Chesapeake StockFor the record, none of its rivals have fared much better since late October. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) hasn't been hit quite as hard, though it's still down to the tune of 5%, while Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) has fallen 24% for the three-month stretch. There's been nowhere for any energy name to hide from the 23% setback in oil prices for the timeframe in question.And yet, though Chesapeake Energy desperately needs oil prices to rebound to prompt a corresponding rebound from Chesapeake stock, there's arguably no better company poised to support such a bounce.Thank CEO Doug Lawler, mostly.Lawler was named CEO in 2013, recruited from rival Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). Though he handled international and deepwater operations for his previous employer, he was actually a holdover from Oklahoma's Kerr-McGee, which was acquired by Anadarko in 2006.His experience and familiarity with the area have proven invaluable.Lawler is reshaping the company to focus first and foremost on the Powder River Basin and Eagle Ford. The former covers a swath of southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming, while the latter sweeps through the heart of Texas.The recently-completed acquisition of WildHorse Resources adds 420,000 acres of exposure to Eagle Ford, and simultaneously triples the company's proved-but-undeveloped oil reserves to 320 million barrels.Meanwhile, Chesapeake is shedding properties outside of the area of focus, like its Utica shale assets in Ohio.There's more to the remix of properties than streamlining and debt-reduction though. The company explained in the middle of last year (and not for the first time) &quot;The Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas remains Chesapeake's EBITDA-generating backbone, consistently delivering high-margin oil volumes and stable production.&quot;It's similarly mastered the nuances of the Powder River Basin.The development of properties in those two regions goes beyond an expertise of that turf, however. Both areas are close to the Gulf Coast, where premium prices for crude can be found more often than not. It's the Little ThingsThe new configuration is bearing fruit, when tepid oil and gas prices aren't prematurely picking it.It's not an easy premise to prove. A quick review of its historical balance sheet data reveals its total liabilities of $12.8 billion is more or less in line with 2017's final tally of $12.4 billion. Take a look further back in time though. As of 2014, when gas and crude prices were on the verge of collapse, that figure was a stunning $40.7 billion.That's enough progress for Moody's to upgrade the company's remaining debt to B2, making it cheaper for Chesapeake to secure new debt or refinance existing debt.More important, the cost and headache of restructuring hasn't crimped production. Chesapeake Energy reported in early January it believes it produced about 463,000 BOE per day, versus analyst estimates of 448,000. It's a hint that the outfit is getting more out of its assets than anticipated, or at least doing so at a faster-than-expected pace. WildHorse may drive more growth than currently expected as well.Lawler isn't thinking or acting recklessly though. Also early in the year the company announced it was culling its rig count from 19 to what should be an average of 14 by year's end, to reflect contracted oil and gas prices.Shuttering those rigs will reduce unnecessary expenses until higher crude prices justify their reactivation, adding onto cost cuts that have already been realized. During the third quarter of last year, production costs fell from $3.03 per BOE a year earlier to $2.68 per BOE thanks to sales of lackluster properties and smarter use of remaining ones.Chesapeake's post-implosion rebuild has arguably been one of the best in the business. Bottom Line for Chesapeake StockNone of these initiatives are readily evident to current and prospective shareholders, however, keeping a cap on CHK stock in an environment that's already been less than friendly to energy stocks. It will take an oil rebound for the upside of the Lawler-led effort to become clear and buyable.That recovery is more likely to be a matter of &quot;when&quot; than &quot;if&quot; though.In spite of the economic caterwauling, the EIA forecasts that consumption of oil will continue to grow in 2019 as it did in 2018, with no great net increases in production capacity on the horizon. And, to the extent new oil spigots could be opened, OPEC is curtailing its output this year to counterbalance the United States' ramped-up production.Although oil stockpiles in the U.S. are moving slightly higher now, the total days' worth of crude in inventory has been quietly falling since February of last year.If nothing else, its forward-looking P/E of 4.6 makes CHK stock a ticker to add to a watchlist, for the point where crude and natural gas prices finally make their pivot.The fourth quarter earnings report slated for Feb. 27 could make or break the bullish argument.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

That's weakening the U.S. dollar, which in turn, is helping lift commodity stocks.

Energy stocks are a big beneficiary and quickly becoming some of the best stocks to invest in now. In fact, the Energy Select SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLE) is rising up and over its January resistance levels to return to prices not seen since early December -- marking a 22% rise off of its recent low. A run to the 200-day moving average, which looks likely now, would be worth a gain of roughly 8% from here.

A number of energy stocks in the industry group are looking good for new money. Here are five of the best stocks to invest in the energy sector now.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### 

### Exxon Mobil (XOM)

Shares of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) are surging higher on Friday, up 3.3% in a cut above XOM's 50-day moving average, capping a gain of roughly 17% off of its late December lows. The company reported earnings of $1.41 per share, 33 cents ahead of estimates on $71.9 billion in revenue. CEO Darren Woods told CNBC that streamlining operations has improved results and that he expects profits, even if oil prices remained low -- with their Permian basin operation in the green below $50-a-barrel.

When the company last reported on Nov. 2, earnings of $1.46 beat estimates by 24 cents on a 25.4% rise in revenues.

### 

### Chevron (CVX)

Chevron (NYSE:CVX) shares are also on the move, rising 3.5% to move up and over their 200-day moving average thanks to a solid earnings report. Earnings of $1.85 beat estimates by 6 cents on a 10.76% rise in revenues. Upstream revenues, net of last year's tax change benefit, grew from $360 million to $964 million.

  * 10 High-Yield Monthly Dividend Stocks 



When the company last reported on Nov. 2, earnings of $2.11 beat estimates by 5 cents on a 21.5% rise in revenues.

### 

### ConocoPhillips (COP)

Shares of ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are rising above their 200-day moving average, capping a rise of more than 21% off of their recent lows. The company reported results on Thursday, with earnings of $1.13 per share beating estimates by 12 cents. This good news follows a series of analyst upgrades back in December from the likes of Wolfe Research and Tudor Pickering.

The company will next report results on May 2 before the bell.

### 

### Hess (HES)

Shares of Hess (NYSE:HES) the mid-size exploration and production company, are extending away from their 50-day moving average to close in on resistance from its 200-day average not tested since early November. Shares have been mired in a sideways bottoming pattern since 2015. Watch for a run at the prior high set in early October, which would be worth a gain of nearly 40% from here.

  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy 



The company will next report results on May 1 before the bell. Analysts are looking for a loss of 18 cents per share on revenues of $1.4 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 30, a loss of 31 cents per share beat estimates by 7 cents on a 30.3% rise in revenues.

### 

### Devon Energy (DVN)

Shares of Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) are consolidating above their 50-day moving average, setting up a possible run at the 200-day average that was last touched back in October. Analyst sentiment has been mixed, with upgrades form the likes of CapitalOne and downgrades by Johnson Rice and others. But with the wind at its back, and the benefit of an inverse head-and-shoulders reversal pattern developing, an upside extension looks likely.

The company will next report results on Feb. 19 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 31 cents per share on revenues of $2.1 billion. When the company last reported on Nov. 6, earnings of 63 cents per share beat estimates by 21 cents on a 33.4% rise in revenues.

As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-01	2019-02-01 13:43:49	COP	ConocoPhillips	ConocoPhillips Stock Is a Growth and Income Double-Whammy	"ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has been around since 1875, doing pretty much what it does today -- it looks for oil (and natural gas, nowadays), produces it, then ships it to refiners and then sells the component parts.

COP isn't a completely integrated big oil like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) or BP PLC (NYSE:BP) but it has built a solid niche and knows how to get through good and bad times.

It also has expanded its operations around the world from its Texas home, although it is a significant player in the U.S. energy patch, having been one of its pioneers over 100 years ago.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Oil prices now sit in the low $50's, and nowadays, that's a decent price -- it's cheap enough for consumers in the U.S. but is still profitable for producers. This wasn't the case a few years back, when Saudi Arabia drove the price of oil down dramatically to run U.S. oil firms out of business.

Since then, exploration and production (E&P) firms have automated their operations and now have better margins, which gives them better downside protection.

  * 7 Stocks With Too Much Riding On China 



At this point, U.S. production is humming along and as the economy continues to recover, demand will also continue to rise. Right now it's in a sweet spot where margins are solid for E&P firms and prices are helping consumers and businesses.

But beyond the U.S. demand, the rest of the world is also looking for more energy, and they pay handsomely for oil and natural gas. And this is where COP's global strategy gives it an opportunity beyond the domestic market. It can supply into overseas markets from overseas facilities. This makes delivery easier and helps keep margins strong by shortening the supply chain.

The other strength COP brings to the table is its healthy mix of oil and natural gas operations. In 2017, oil made up about 50% of the company's production. Natural gas made up 38%. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) made up about 7% and bitumen (basically asphalt, which is derived from petroleum products) made up 5%.

Having this balance means COP isn't too heavily weighted into either energy market. That's a good thing when we're in the kind of economy we're in right now.

Companies are continuing to transition to natural gas from coal because it's a more efficient fuel, which means it's cheaper to burn. And it's cleaner, which means it's easier to keep the equipment that burns it operational.

Also, natural gas prices in Asia and Europe are several times higher than they are in the U.S., so the margins are incredible. Because COP stock has global distribution channels it can take advantage of these pricing disparities much better than US-focused companies.

And as an established energy company with a $78 billion market cap, it is shareholder friendly. It delivers a 1.8% dividend and the stock is up more than 8% in 2019.

While that kind of growth won't be typical, it will be a solid grower with a solid dividend as long you need gas in your tank or flames on your stove.

2019-01-25	2019-01-25 18:45:11	COP	ConocoPhillips	10 Triple-A Stocks to Buy in February	"They say it's a bullish sign when the markets climb a wall of worry. That means, while things look grim -- government shutdown, unimpressive earnings, slow trade talks with China, Brexit confusion, saber-rattling in oil-rich Venezuela -- the market keeps on chugging upwards.

Something good must be happening just beyond the horizon. Remember, the market is always looking six months out, so whatever is happening this quarter was priced in more or less last year.

It's likely the market sees lower interest rates that will revive real estate and housing sectors, solid consumer spending that will help retail and a happy ending to the trade war with China.

  * 5 of the Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term 



With that in mind, I thought it might be a good idea to feature 10 triple-A stocks to buy in February from my Portfolio Grader. All took high marks in sales, earnings and quant categories, the latter meaning there's gathering interest in the shares.

### Amazon (AMZN)

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an easy one to start with. After a sluggish 2018 -- the stock only rose a mere 28%, when its three-year average is around 58% annually -- it is already moving quickly to get back on its uniquely powerful growth pace.

And as long as consumers keep spending, AMZN will keep racking up the gains.

AMZN is moving into the beauty sector now, launching its &quot;find&quot; brand in the UK, with move regions to follow. Its focused on beauty supplies at the $20-and-under price level, but if its popular, you can be sure AMZN will expand up the price chain.

The one tough spot is its move into the Indian market. Having already sunk at least $5 billion developing the market, new laws may make its headway more difficult. But it still has plenty of opportunities beyond India.

### ConocoPhillips (COP)

ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one of the oldest oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) firms in the U.S. And it's also one of the biggest E&Ps in the world, having operations around the globe. It even has an LNG (liquified natural gas) export port in Australia to ship natural gas to Asia, where margins are the highest in the world.

COP is a story of economies. When economies are expanding, demand for energy rises. When economies contract, energy demand slacks. In either case, the first sector to feel the move is E&Ps, since their focus is on getting it out of the ground or finding new places to explore.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



Because of its size, COP is a great choice in this sector right now. It's big enough to absorb some of the short-term volatility but it will still keep some of the leverage when demand increases. It's a solid value right now.

### Veeva Systems (VEEV)

Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) is up more than 20% in January and up nearly 83% in the past 12 months. This stock was completely unaffected by last year's tech tumult.

Why?

Because it has built a unique niche where it is the leading firm -- it makes cloud-based software solutions for life sciences companies.

Life sciences is a unique animal when it comes to the demand on a cloud-based system. There all sorts of regulations and protocols about information sharing and documentation. Plus, all the research aspects and then the marketing side of things make for a very complex system.

Veeva is a leader in this sector. And given the generally conservative nature of doctors and research scientists, going with a proven name is a big deal. And it shows in VEEV stock's success.

### Abiomed (ABMD)

Abiomed (NASDAQ:ABMD) is a medical device company that has carved out its own unique and important niche in the sector. It makes artificial heart pumps -- the smallest in the world. And it makes equipment that helps monitor and manage diagnostics on heart function with its Impella-brand pumps.

This is one of those devices that are valued by all parties -- surgeons, patients, hospitals and insurers. It means less invasive surgeries, which means less down time and risk of infection, which means less costs.

  * 7 Stupidly Cheap Stocks to Buy Now 



As industrialized world, where quality healthcare is reasonably accessible, ages, these kinds of solutions become much more in demand. And given its reputation in this sector, ABMD is at the top of the list when healthcare professionals and insurers are ordering equipment.

### Medpace Holdings (MEDP)

Medpace Holdings (NASDAQ:MEDP) is one of a new breed of companies that specializes in partnering with pharmaceutical and healthcare equipment companies to work through clinical trials.

These types of companies are also known as clinical research organizations (CROs).

With clinical trials for pharmaceuticals running about $2 billion per drug, it's important that pharmas are doing it right the first time.

Traditionally, big pharmas would take a drug from its own R&D, develop it, get it through trials and then market it. Nowadays, big pharma can buy a promising drug (or drug company) or partner with another firm, assess its potential, contract out the trials and then market it. MEDP takes that trial piece.

This is a very promising sector and MEDP is one of the leaders. It has had a solid move in January and that should continue for a long time to come.

### Trade Desk (TTD)

Trade Desk (NYSE:TTD) is a new advertising company that is making a big splash. It basically has built a digital advertising platform that allows marketers to create personalized marketing experiences across platforms and channels.

Essentially, it allows marketers to buy space on mobile, social and desktop, and develop targeted audiences with targeted messages and video. It's the next wave in advertising and is a trail that was blazed by big firms like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon and is now finding its way to the mainstream.

  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks You Really Need to Look at for 2019 



The stock is up a stunning 185% in the past 12 months, and over 20% in January alone. The one caveat here is its trailing price-to-earnings ratio is around 100, which given its growth seems fairly reasonable. But advertising revenue is tricky and can vary. If it varies to the downside, volatility will ensue. Be patient.

### Ritchie Brothers Auctioneers (RBA)

Ritchie Brothers Auctioneers (NYSE:RBA) is a unique company that is in an ideal position in the current market.

It is one of the leading auction houses for industrial and agricultural equipment in North America. It has onsite auctions and online auctions as well as brokerage services.

If you're a construction company that needs more equipment but aren't sure if buying new is a good move right now, RBA is a good source. And the same can be said of farmers who are looking to offload some equipment or pick up something without spending big on a new rig.

It's not growing like a tech stock, but this is a solid business that has been around since 1958, so it knows its customers and respects its shareholders.

### Sabra Healthcare REIT (SBRA)

Sabra Healthcare REIT (NASDAQ:SBRA) has been on a roll in 2019, up more than 20% so far. That's impressive for a REIT (real estate investment trust) that specializes in properties for healthcare-related companies.

Actually, that's pretty impressive for most REITs -- or most stocks for that matter.

A REIT is structured so that shareholders are &quot;paid&quot; out of the company's net profits, like they're an owner. REITs usually do this in the form of a dividend. SBRA is delivering a 9% dividend at this point, and that's after its big run.

This is one of the top growth sectors in the REIT universe at this point. And it has a long way to go before it starts to slow down. If you're looking for a long-term total return play, this is it.

### Inogen (INGN)

Inogen (NASDAQ:INGN) is a healthcare equipment company that has been very good at establishing itself in a long-term trend with a specialized product in a growing sector.

INGN makes portable oxygen concentrators for long-term use. Traditionally, people that had respiratory issues and needed supplemental oxygen had to wheel around tanks of oxygen. The tanks are heavy, so they needed a small cart to wheeled around. The whole process is difficult and cumbersome, especially for those it was trying to help.

INGN products essentially take the oxygen from the air and concentrate it, so there's no need for the tanks. Their products can be carried on your shoulder. And units for the house are also less ungainly. What's more, there are no more oxygen tanks -- full or empty -- laying around the house and getting delivered.

### Rexford Industrial Realty (REXR)

Rexford Industrial Realty (NYSE:REXR) specializes in industrial properties in Southern California.

Bear in mind that the two top seaports in the U.S. are the Los Angeles seaport and the Long Beach seaport. That means enormous amounts of goods are coming and going out of these ports and need to be stowed somewhere until they're ready to be shipped or distributed.

REXR has only been in business for about six years, so it's still in its acquisition phase. While the China-U.S. trade war may slow it business a bit, it's also an opportunity to buy up properties from companies that are having a tough time operating their properties.

  * 5 of the Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term 



It's delivering a 1.9% dividend right now, which isn't a lot for a REIT, but REXR stock is up 12% this month. More positive movement on trade talks will help lift it even more.

2019-01-10	2019-01-10 16:59:46	COP	ConocoPhillips	Did Trade Talks Impact Oil-Weighted Stocks More than Oil?	"Did Trade Talks Impact Oil-Weighted Stocks More than Oil?

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Oil-weighted stocks

The following oil-weighted stocks could be the most sensitive to US crude oil’s movements. They might be impacted the most by oil’s price movement based on their correlations with US crude oil active futures in the trailing week:

  * ConocoPhillips (COP) at 70.5%
  * Concho Resources (CXO) at 65.6%.
  * Oasis Petroleum (OAS) at 49.2%
  * EOG Resources (EOG) at 37.4%
  * Diamondback Energy (FANG) at 27.3%



## Impact of trade talks

In the trailing week, US crude oil active futures rose 12.5%. Occidental Petroleum was the third-largest gainer on our list of oil-weighted stocks. The top gainers, Callon Petroleum (CPE) and Whiting Petroleum (WLL) rose 30.5% and 20.6%, respectively, in the trailing week despite having a mild negative correlation with oil prices. The trade talks between the US and China might have caused these stocks to increase. In the previous part, we discussed that easing trade war concerns might be behind the rise in oil prices. ConocoPhillips had the highest correlation with oil. ConocoPhillips has risen 4.8%—the lowest among our selected oil-weighted stocks.

All of these oil-weighted stocks are part of the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP). They have production mixes of at least 60.0% in liquids based on their latest quarterly production data. Liquids include crude oil, condensates, and natural gas liquids.

2019-01-09	2019-01-09 20:37:02	COP	ConocoPhillips	10 Best Energy Stocks to Buy for a 2019 Gusher	"Energy stocks have had a difficult 2018. Mostly flat performance through most of the year turned into a tailspin in October as oil prices plunged from above $75 per barrel to below $50. That in turn has pinched oil companies that rely on elevated commodity prices to drive larger profits.

The headwinds are clear. Demand has slowed to a crawl, and supplies have piled up despite production cuts from several nations. Fears about U.S.-China trade relations have weighed, as have worries about sanctions on Iran.

It's no wonder why energy stocks have taken it on the chin.

But the skies are starting to clear as we head into 2019. OPEC and other nations are beginning to discuss additional output curbs, and with U.S. shale producers running at full capacity, there really isn't much room for them to pick up any slack. The U.S. and China have made progress on trade talks, too, including a 90-day moratorium on increasing tariffs.

Investors diving into the sector still need to be choosy. A rebound in oil is far from a certainty, which means it's necessary to put a premium on quality right now. Here, we look at the 10 best energy stocks to buy for 2019 - those that can best take advantage of the current energy environment.

The move - a shift from previous practices where QP used to  borrow up to 70 percent of its needs from banks - might be a  disappointment for banks.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qatar-petroleum-invest-20-bln-122657702.html?.tsrc=rss

Kaabi was concerned OPEC membership could be a stumbling block for QP's ambitions in the United States, where it has one of the world's biggest LNG terminals, and a distraction as Doha doubles down on gas production, three industry sources said.  Proposed U.S. legislation known as NOPEC (No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act) could expose members of the oil exporters club to antitrust lawsuits, a risk for QP at a time it is planning to invest billions more in the United States.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opec-exit-frees-qatar-u-074059044.html?.tsrc=rss

The swift growth of American shale production has complicated efforts by OPEC and its allies to trim supply and support prices.

A chronic lack of investment, new military-led management at  state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA,  known as PDVSA, and sanctions imposed on the company by U.S.  President Donald Trump's administration have contributed to  lower exports of Venezuelan oil in recent years, especially to  the United States.  Shipments of Venezuelan crude to the United States had  exceeded 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September as PDVSA  raised cash to pay creditors, including bondholders and U.S.  producer ConocoPhillips.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/venezuelan-crude-sales-u-fell-170946899.html?.tsrc=rss

On Monday, private equity firm Carlyle Group became  the latest to place a bet, proposing with the Port of Corpus  Christi what it said would be the first onshore U.S. export  facility able to load the world's largest crude tankers.  The contest comes as the shale revolution is expected to  send the nation's oil production to 11.8 million barrels per day  by the end of 2019, from 9.35 million bpd in 2017, according to  the U.S. Energy Information Administration.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rising-u-crude-output-sparks-164230125.html?.tsrc=rss

Natural, many oil stocks have sunk hard as well — with the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLE) down about 14% since the start of October.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-beaten-down-crude-oil-162135603.html?.tsrc=rss

Martin Rowe, Zennor’s managing director, said the year had been “transformational for Zennor”, citing the acquisition of a 9 per cent interest in the ConocoPhillips-operated Britannia platform last month, which doubled the company’s output to 5,000 boe/d and provided it with the infrastructure to develop Finalaggan as a subsea tieback.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/bb32b232-95fb-310b-aea0-1591c8626c03/%5B%24%24%5D-zennor-gains-regulator.html?.tsrc=rss

State-run oil company PDVSA has drawn up a plan to process up to 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) of foreign crude in June at the country's largest refinery.  The fuels produced would fulfil export contracts largely to Russian and Chinese customers and reduce purchases of fuels for domestic use, the documents seen on Wednesday showed.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-venezuela-eyes-first-ever-212658434.html?.tsrc=rss

Citgo Petroleum has been buying crude from multiple countries worldwide as PDVSA has been unable to comply with the contractual volume of heavy crude due to falling output and port congestion slowing deliveries, according to the traders.  Declining oil production, lawsuits by creditors, shortages of spare parts for terminals and executive braindrain have all reduced PDVSA's ability to export oil.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citgo-seeks-crude-supplies-venezuela-214500204.html?.tsrc=rss

From January through April, Citgo was the customer most affected by PDVSA's inability to fulfill its supply contracts due to declining oil output, which this year has fallen to its lowest level in 33 years, according to internal PDVSA data.  U.S. producer ConocoPhillips' actions to seize PDVSA's assets in the Caribbean since May have extended the Venezuelan firm's export delays, leading to a tanker backlog representing nearly a month's worth of shipments from its main terminal.	https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citgo-seeks-alternative-oil-supplies-163242574.html?.tsrc=rss

Falling production from Venezuela has contributed to a rally in global oil prices (CLc1) (LCOc1) to a near four-year high, and other OPEC members may boost output at a meeting later this month to compensate for the shortfall and other risks to global supplies.

Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he planned to impose sanctions on Iran and that the U.S. would sanction any nation that helps Tehran pursue nuclear weapons as well as U.S. and foreign companies and banks that continue to do business with the country.  Although investors had widely anticipated the news,  oil prices and shares of energy companies climbed in response, as many expect fresh sanctions to hurt Iranian crude exports and reduce global supply.	https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f3b32bab-b771-39a9-bc98-83a0a265b9f0/u.s.-stocks-rise-as-energy.html?.tsrc=rss
